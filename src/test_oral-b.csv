We chose the brand name dependent on the reviews and have been very happy with them.

The text on the package is in several languages including English.It is a Braun product, not any imitation. I immediately started using one of the brush heads to test it. It seems perfectly normal and fine, exactly the same as the brush heads that came with the original Braun toothbrush.Mr. Bargain\'s service was outstanding. Within about 2 hours of placing the order on Amazon.com, I received an email from Mr. Bargain that it was being shipped. The email included the USPS tracking number. I received the product the next day by US Mail, packed in a nice padded envelope."

I just wish they weren\'t so pricey, but if this means healthier teeth (my boyfriend\'s dentist knew that he had been using an electric toothbrush when he went to his check up, because it was night and day) it is probably worth the investment."

However, when I ordered last time I also received a free Dual Action brush head, and I really, really like this one.  I will probably order the Dual Action next time because it works so well; it outperformed the Flexisoft brush head.I also like the great price I received from American Beauty, and the timely manner in which I received my order."

47,48,20051207,B00006ANDJ,3,"December 7, 2005",A198CCH4NNLI2E,Bristles seems engineered to fail quickly,"Remember when you didn\'t need to replace your toothbrush every 12 weeks? It\'s almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money. While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year."

If you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex, your teeth suffer. The Oral B head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth, you can. I have not had a cavity in years. My pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed. If only these woked on abs."

56,57,20050308,B00006ANDJ,5,"March 8, 2005",A2WXIJTI5PEV9N,Making a dent in the war against tooth decay,"This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it\'s kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is currently for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $9.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are 3 of them).  There are other offers through Amazon for this exact same item for up to $19.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!  Currently, this listing is the best price for this item, but it might not always be in the future."

When I contacted the company, they wanted me to incur the cost of returning the product. After complaining to the service rep, the company finally relented and provided me with a prepaid shipping label. After the product was returned, it took another 10 days for the company to send me the correct product. Accordingly, I would rate my overall experience as fair and I am not sure if I would order other products from this company"

They are smaller and seem to me to do a great job.The one thing I miss from my Sonicare brushes is the head cover.

I used to buy this type, because this was the only choice that I could find in the retail stores. Usually, \'Dual Clean\' heads also were available, but I do not like them. They are just so big. I wanted to switch to another type, and I did a little research. I found Oral-B \'Sensitive\' heads, and I found good reviews on this product. I am using this heads for a few weeks now. I bought this product because it probably has the highest bristle density, and the bristles are extra soft so they are very gentle on the gum. In my opinion, they do a very good job. I feel that they clean better than \'Precision Clean\' heads. I use HydroFloss after brushing. When I was using \'Precision Clean,\' I used to still see some stuff coming out of the area between my teeth during cleaning with HydroFloss. However, this stopped when I switched to \'Sensitive\' heads. I feel that \'Sensitive\' head is cleaning better. It is also more gentle on my gum."

I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head).

While the packaging looks OEM, the quality of these heads is vastly inferior to ones purchased off the shelf at Target/CVS/etc.  The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  I\'ve used Oral-B electric brushes for over 10 years, and these heads behaved very differently.  After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!) during operation.  Also, I noticed that the \'blue indicator bristles\' never changed color at all after 8-12 weeks of use.  I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  I have noted other reviews echo these same problems.My opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...I am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product."

I somehow found the first three but, unfortunately swallowed the forth today. The small piece makes thebrush head rotate in a uniform patten.  When it breaks you can stilluse the toothbrush but, with lesses results; what\'s the point in that?If your order packaging looks old and worn, the plastic is old also causing premature aging of the plastic heads making them brittle.

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It\'s kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

They do come loose and fall off in my mouth, there is not the same vibrating motion, they are a little rough. Also, I closely compared an off brand one to an Oral-B and found that there are less bristles on the cheaper one. The bristles are in little groups: Oral B=26, offbrand=18. So, you get what you pay for, I am afraid. Still, Oral B could be kinder and charge less for these simple little things, we know it costs very little to make them.

The outer bristles are raised about two millimeters above the middle ones- meaning that you have to gnash them into your gums just to make contact between the middle bristles and your teeth. Then there\'s the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush. It\'s like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face. There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience."

Now you might suggest that I prefer it because I\'ve got a big mouth, but that\'s not the case (surprised?). I find smaller toothbrushes take too long to get the job done, even allowing 2-3 minutes per brushing.The Oral B 60 brushes are hard to find in stores (and I do look), so a 6 pack lasts me a while. The brushes aren\'t too soft or hard, and my dentist thinks my old teeth aren\'t in all that bad condition, and seem to be reasonably well cleaned. I even give away the toothbrush he hands out at each visit and use the Oral B 60 instead."
426,434,20120414,B0002KHTG6,2,"April 14, 2012",A34E2DIWNBEJ19,"Too big, too hard",This is a nice idea for a brush but poorly executed. The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision. The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure. Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums. I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.

They are brand name Oral B replacements. If you\'re thinking about being cheap and buying a knock off replacement please don\'t! Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the real thing. Your Oral B toothbrush was meant to be used with Oral B heads. The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand. As far as the advertised \'Pro White\', I cannot attest to that. I seem to highly doubt that just by using a different head that you\'re teeth are magically gonna become whiter.

The Dual Action / Dual Clean is another matter. It started out working alright, although like many others I found the brush head to be a bit too large. One day while brushing, the brush severely pinched my tongue causing it to bleed. Upon close inspection, the lower oblong brush seemed loose with a substantial gap between it and the brush housing. I suspect that over time friction wears away at the internal parts leading to looseness.I was not happy about the experience and sent the defective brush to Procter & Gamble for evaluation. I was quite surprised when they replied that no manufacturing defect was present, despite being informed of the loose lower brush. They could provide no explanation as to how the injury occurred and would not provide any contact information for me to escalate the issue.

Cleans great and does not hurt my gums.  I have had my Oral B for eight years now. I almost purchased a Sonicare but toothbrush but then read reviews.  Figured i would give my Oral B one more chance.  This head saved the day and i continue to be happy with my toothbrush."

At first I was afraid to open the packaging because of all those reports about brush heads having no repacement ring, having an oral-B insignia with a grey background, and made in Germany are counterfiet. But, eventually I opened the package, and nothing is wrong with the brush head. It is Not a Tongue Mutilator, nor does it have out of shape bristels, not is it a counterfeit. All those pieces of information are either false, or just one time bad experiences. My brush head still has its shape maintained, isn\'t too hard and hasn\'t done anything funky. I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time and I just like it. If someone has a smaller than average mouth then, or if you\'re one of those people who was used to small brush heads back in the day (when you used conventional brushes), then this brush head is not for you. Otherwise its a wonderful brush head and it definitely beats the precission brush head by far (I haven\'t used the floss action brush head yet so I dont know if that one is any better)."

You will have to stand over the sink while using these, but that is not an issue for me.  If it is a problem for you, I\'d definitely recommend the FlossAction over the ProWhite.  The Dual Clean heads don\'t fit in the traveling case, so I still purchase the FlossAction for traveling and when my mouth was swollen and sore after getting some wisdom teeth pulled.

Upon receiving the product, it did not look anything like the original brush heads that I received with the toothbrush I bought months ago from Amazon. The primary differences were: the bristles were the wrong color(the center green was a darker translucent color instead of the opaque light green), the bristles were splayed out instead of in tight clusters, and the gray logo was much lighter. I chalked this up to maybe changes in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the first brush head I tried did not work at all. I chalked that up to manufacturing defect. The second one worked, but didn\'t quite feel right. I decided to just go with it however, and after a month the brush head became very loose. I saw the other reviews and photos and realized that I had received fake product directly from Amazon.Here is the worst part. I decided to purchase replacement heads from Walgreens retail store. I got home and realized that they were also fake product. So, then I went to Target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine. I was floored to find fake product in a retail chain store as well as at Amazon.So, TLDR buyer beware of fake product when ordering online or shopping at retail. Look at the brush heads carefully before you make your purchase. It seems like there is a major counterfeiting problem right now and it hopefully gets resolved soon."

I\'ve been reading that these heads fall apart in your mouth while brushing so I\'m returning mine before they have a chance to do that.

This hole spits out your toothpaste/saliva mix anytime that you happen to maneuver the brush so that this part come out through your lips.  The result is a flow of toothpaste and saliva all over your brand new shirts - this sucks unless you like paying for unnecessary dry cleaning.  The alternative is to lean over the sink so that gravity will pull this flow down into the sink, not down on to yourself.  This is rather uncomfortable after about 2-3 minutes of standing in this awkward position.  The projectile saliva/toothpaste mix is an inevitability with this design - it sucks!  I hate this product and will never buy it again.  What a waste!  Supposedly the best on the market?  What a joke!"

They are 3 times as expensive as non-flossing heads.  They do a better job of cleaning for me, penetrating deeper into the teeth gaps and gum layer.  I use the other brush heads too because I am not sure whether these create gum wear.  I still floss, as these brush heads are not a real substitute.  When I use these flossing brush heads I feel more comfortable flossing just the deep areas between my teeth.  This means I\'m hacking at my gums less with floss, but feel just as clean.

I bought mine a little over a year ago and immediately fell in love with it. It works wonderfully, it cleans your teeth amazingly. My teeth have been whiter and strong since I started using it. The replacement heads aren\'t too expensiuve either. I get my 3 packs here on Amazon for $13 and you only have to replace them every 2 months I\'d say - but you could wait longer and it still works fine. It even tells you when it\'s time to replace by starting with blue bristles that slowly turn to white as it\'s used. It has a timer on it so you brush your teeth for the full recommended time. When your done it shows a smiley face. It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want. It doesn\'t hurt your teeth and does a great job, you don\'t even have to press it to your teeth. If your looking to buy one - buy this one. It\'s so great I even bought myself a second one for when I travel. :)"

1106,1131,20080428,B000AUIFCA,4,"April 28, 2008",A3VYKXHQDICC6,OK,"I\'ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for the last 10+ years. Usually, I buy the regular, round Flexisoft brush heads. The last time I tried to purchase them, however, the store was out of stock. But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.They work well. They deliver that nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and expect from our Oral-B\'s. In this regard, they are at least the equivalent of the Flexisofts, and they may even be slightly superior.Braun embeds 4 little rubber \'paddles\' into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss. I can not detect any \'flossing\' from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess. It may be that the \'paddles\' do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell. They cause no discomfort. The brushing feels slightly different, but not unpleasant.The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers. Rather than being circular, like the regular heads, it is an oval. The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large. I think that one of the Oral-B\'s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth. That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.When I need to replace these, I will look for the regular Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. In my opinion, those are the best. But if I can\'t find them, I would not hesitate to buy these again.***UPDATE 2/2011: It amazes me, but there appears to be a *thriving* market in counterfeit Oral-B Brush Heads! I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon. Under the price, where it says \'Sold By\' make sure that it says \'Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\' If it doesn\'t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \'More Buying Choices,\' and see if you can find one that says Amazon. Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don\'t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon."

In fact, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.  For regular toothbrush users, the difference is huge.  I could never go back to a regular brush.However, I have a huge gripe with people who post products for a ridiculously cheap price only to essentially double the cost with shipping.  In this case, $16 for the heads and $11 to ship them.  I can\'t imagine from their weight, that they cost anymore than $2-$3 to ship, so how someone justifies the extra $9 is beyond me.Bottom line is that this is a fantastic product that I have been extremely happy with, but the seller\'s price is (in my opinion) misleading at best and probably could be more accurately described as downright dishonest."

I would give it three stars except that it still functions flawlessly in my coffee maker.To the people who are getting grounds through, change your grind to a slightly courser grind.

It makes great drip coffee whether you like it light or strong, and the filter is the reason why. We won\'t ever go back to paper filters; the gold filter is the way to go. Our only complaint is that if you like REALLY strong coffee AND want a lot of it (i.e., more than 8 cups...according to the water gauge), you are out-of-luck  because  the coffee grounds flow over the top of filter. Grounds in coffee - not so good.Finally, the Brita water filter that is a part of this coffee-maker (sold separately of course) works well too."

It just doesn\'t feel natural to simply stand there while it does the work. The Pulsonic is a nice middle ground, with me doing a minimalist interpretation of the standard brushing motion and the machine providing supplementary brushes that greatly exceed anything I would be able to do on my own. I also like that it is much less bulky and feels more natural in my hand. I went into my dentist four months (and zero uses of dental floss) after starting with the Pulsonic and she said \'finally, you\'re actually using dental floss! I\'m so proud of you\'. I didn\'t want to break her heart, so I just nodded and smiled.My only problem with the refills is the stupid pick thing that you have to buy along with the three heads, and thus the three star review.

So much for corporate diagnostics and sales grids.  Not stocking the Oral-B Brush is similar to the Republican Party blaming the Democratic party for all of the offenses and bullyism that the Republicans commit.Political skullduggery aside, the Oral-B Brush keeps my teeth as white and clean as nothing else I have used in the past.  Using the brush is an integral part of my teeth cleaning ritual and practice morning, noon, and night.  It also keeps me smiling and out of the dentist\'s chair.  Thank goodness Amazon made the decision to carry it.  For the price and the result, my recommendation is that you start brushing with the Oral-B Brush today.

The brushes arrived in perfect shape much more quickly than expected.  I would buy from this seller again and give them 5 stars.Dec update: I wish this came in an actual 4 pack. I can\'t use the one that is supposed to clean between your teeth as I don\'t have that much space between my teeth so that one is wasted on me. I\'d rather they had a pack of brushes and a pack of those so that we could purchase only what we actually need.  The brushes however, while harder than I am used to are color coded so that the head can be switched for multiple people to use.  The thing to remember about brushing with these is what I keep in my head every single time, let the brush do the work, otherwise you will be brushing too hard and hurt the enamel on your teeth.  What I really wish is, that I could use the oral b sonic complete brushes with this brush handle, I don\'t understand why they make different brush heads for each of their sonic toothbrushes or barring that, they would actually be consistent in their brusheads, these really should be softer."

The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.  I bought this second one in 9/2010 while Amazon & OralB had a 50% off rebate so ended up paying only $25 for it - a definite buy at that price!

The lower \'sensitive\' speed does not tickle the gums, and the pick like brush allows me to carefully brush the gum line and the crevices between teeth.  After a month of use and a recent perio exam, the dentist says it is looking much better, and to keep up the routine with the new electric tooth brush."

When I asked my dentist, he said getting used to the vibration might take a bit of doing but otherwise he feels the cleaning is superior to brushing. I tried this one because the handle is slim, the charger is small & the reviews said the vibration wasn\'t quite as strong as the more expensive one.  Also, there are 2 settings.

I looked at the oral B Pulsonic and decided to switch due to its smaller diameter like a regular toothbrush. The first time I used it I wasn\'t so sure as you brush in a circular motion. The 2nd time i was hooked. It does a great joband I can honestly say with the sonic care I could feel light tartar after brushing, so i would use a regular toothbrush every other brushing. This Oral B not so, its fantastic. Easier to clean by far. One last thing don\'t press hard let the brush do the work. I have always after brushing with tooth paste then redo with just a clean brush. No problems in 12 years from the dentist. Hope this helps."

Oral B did a pretty good job of ripping off the Sonicare technology.  What  I did not like is that the Oral B didn\'t shut off automatically after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, plus the shutoff button accumulates toothpaste runoff in the process, which can be kind off gross to turn off.  Maybe it is the shape of the Oral B brush, but it sometimes felt like it missed those hard to reach places too.  Still a decent product with a decent price.  If I had it to do over though, I would probably spend more money and buy the Sonicare again."

Better portability; however, because of the small diameter of the base, it doesn\'t stand upright that well (but too big to fit in any toothbrush holder slots)- Charging Base...takes up a very small footprint on sink- Price...much lower than many newer Oral-B/Sonic-care brushes- Performance...cleans extremely well, takes a week or so to get used to it.I did try it out for a day or so, too (don\'t tell the wifey!!!) and was quite pleased by the pulsing sensation and the way it made my teeth feel/look.

It\'s small, inexpensive, and works even better, she says. Thus, she\'s happy, I\'m happy, and I guess her dentist is happy.

Great product!I\'ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in it\'s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I\'ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don\'t know what they\'re talking about. I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down. Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.Don\'t hesitate to purchase a Pulsonic. But shop around for replacement heads. I found there\'s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive. However, this Pulsonic has two speeds, and she has found the slower speed to be perfect for her.Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he\'s happy with it too.

The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  There are no recesses to collect toothpaste, moisture etc., so it is easy to keep clean.  I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...my whole mouth.  It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone. I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \'between\' brush would be a good thing to use. The only change I would make would be to slant the head a bit to enable reaching inside surfaces.  All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...in fact it is still working. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the Sonicare, but for the money, this is the best buy. After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  AND, I do not work for Oral B.  Come on...get real paranoid people...09/10/09:  I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  I have not had this problem.  I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed and I can see where that might create the above mentioned problem.  I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  Just food for thought if trying to decide on this product.  I still love it."

Today it costs $60 on amazon while the Oral-B Pulsonic costs $47.  If you are in the market for a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I\'d say either of these would be a good investment.  Both have two settings, except it seems the Oral-B has the \'faster\' setting start first whereas the WaterPik starts a slower speed first.  The Oral-B is slimmer, lighter, easier to hold onto.  Both brushes come with base units but the unit for the Oral-B is smaller and lighter than that of the WaterPik, but it also is easier to push around by accident.  The WaterPik comes with 2 brush heads, the Oral-B, just one.  When recharging the WaterPik blinks and when it stops, you know it has been charged fully, the Oral-B does not.I have not experienced the trouble of the brush head falling off the Oral-B brush, and overall I would say that the Oral-B seems more \'powerful\' in its vibrations.  I can\'t say that\'s a bad thing, but after using the WaterPik for so long, it\'s something one has to get used to.  Overall I\'d say either electric brush is a good investment.  While you get a little more with the WaterPik, it is also a heavier brush and more expensive.  In the end, all they really do is vibrate and you have to move them around.  If I had a choice, I\'d probably choose the Oral-B (which I switched to as soon as I received it), only because it\'s slimmer and lighter and I find it easier to use."

Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use. Why the three stars and not just one? It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip brush.I have both a Oral-B Triumph and a Sonicare (can\'t remember the model number), and find both to be excellent performers. They are different, and each has its strengths/weaknesses, so I alternate between the two. The one shortcoming neither address well is getting between teeth to get out tea and coffee stains (and the occasional cigarette). For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside. My 6-month dental cleaning/checkup gets rid of them, but by month 4 or 5, they\'re back.Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it\'s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains. The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great. After brushing with either the Triumph or Sonicare, I finish with a 30-60 second run using the Precision Tip. Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth using.For everything else, the Pulsonic is a so-so performer at best. Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I\'ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.If you\'re looking to stop or get rid of in-between teeth stains, get this model and use it in combination with another model. If in-between teeth stains are not an issue, don\'t even bother with this. Pick up a different Oral-B or a Sonicare -- you\'ll be a lot happier with it than the Pulsonic."

That is not the experience I have had with the pulsonic.  Although the brush head vibrates significantly and loosens plaque, I find I\'m having to perform the laborious back-and-forth to the extent that I do with a manual brush.

Consumers are depressed and clenching tighter to their dollars. Companies need innovations in their products in order to stimulate more sales. I get it. However, simply miniaturizing a perfectly good product (like the full-size SonicCare) without adding more values is hardly worth anyone\'s time or money. What is more unnecessary is to sacrifice performance just to make something more, to quote another reviewer, \'aesthetically pleasing\'. When it comes to my dental health, thanks but no thanks, I will take performance any day over form. Compared to the other brushed I have used, this tiny brush definitely feels less effective. Don\'t get me wrong though, this is not a horrible brush. Had I never used any other electric toothbrushes before, I probably would be satisfied with this brush just fine. But after using/reviewing a number of different brushes from Vine program, I\'m used to that more powerful and super fast cleaning offered by the full-size models. In fact, I don\'t mind - and actually prefer - that slightly weightier feel of other brushes in my hand. Mind you, I do travel quite often, but the old brush fits my suitcase just fine."

I didn\'t weigh them, but the Pulsonic is definitely lighter than my Sonicare brush. I also appreciate the fact that the Pulsonic comes with an extra brush head for deep cleaning, along with the standard charger. The basic brush head\'s shape does more for me than the Sonicare\'s as well.The Bad: Unfortunately, I just never felt like the Pulsonic was vibrating/cleaning as hard as my Sonicare. Instead of holding it in place and letting the brush do the work, the Pulsonic requires a fair amount of manual manipulation, during which the brush head can disengage from the main unit.The Verdict: It\'s slicker and cheaper than the competition, but in this case I think you\'re better off spending your money on the deeper cleaning, more reliable Sonicare line."

You need Philips Sonicare.There are good things of this toothbrush, but I think the disappointing things outweigh them. For one thing, the brush\'s head is larger than the Sonicare\'s. This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.The one positive thing is the toothbrush\'s compactness. It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior. But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare."

The first time I have tried it, it felt a bit unpleasant, but I have gotten used to it very quickly. The best thing about this brush is the bigger brush head as compared to Oral-B Triumph. The brush allows you to use twice as much toothpaste (I have always been concerned that I was not using enough toothpaste with round Oral-B brushes), and it seems that it cleans teeth faster on flat surfaces. Getting into corners requires as much effort as with any other toothbrush.What I did not like: the charger is big and you cannot remove extra brush holders; to turn it off you have to push the power button twice (the first time it switches to sensitive mode); you are supposed to use it in a circular motion, and I tend not to be very good at it. In old days I had problems with traditional toothbrushes as I used to move them up and down and ended up scratching my teeth, so I am afraid this might happen with this brush as well.

All have been from the Sonicare and Oral-B line of products.  I have been amazed at how the technology and design of these products have changed over the years.  They continue to get smaller, more powerful, and now tend to include multiple operation modes and interchangeable brushes and accessories.  Although there is clearly nothing wrong with scrubbing your teeth the traditional way, with a good old-fashioned toothbrush, I find that the power toothbrushes tend to remove stains better and keep my teeth whiter.Gone are the days when a power toothbrush was a rather bulky, noisy product.  Oral-B has introduced a new, extremely slim, power toothbrush that is not much bigger than a traditional (manual) toothbrush.  The new Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is truly a breakthrough in power toothbrush design.  Weighing a mere 1.8 oz., with the brush head attached, the dimensions of the handle and brush assembly is roughly 8 1/4\' long and only 11/16\' (just under 3/4\') around at the thickest part of the handle.  The brush head is about 2/3 of the width and 3/4 of the length of a traditional toothbrush.  The charging base measures approximately 1 3/4\' - H x 1 5/8\' - W x 3\' - D.  While I like the small footprint of the charging base, I find it a bit too light, which causes it to slide around on the countertop too easily.Some of the manufacturer boasted features of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush are as follows:* Provides Gentle Sonic Vibration - More than 27,000 Vibrations per Minute* Multiple User Modes:  Clean (normal) and Sensitive* Super-Thin Bristles for Precision Cleaning, Polishing  and Whitening*  Professional Timer, Providing Tactile Feedback at 30-second Intervals for Changing Quadrants of Your Mouth, and Once the Dental Expert Recommended 2-minute Brushing Time Has Been Reached* Provides Up To 30 Minutes Of Use Between Charges* Reduces Up to 94% of Surface Stains in 2 Weeks* Lightweight Slim Handle Provides Effective Maneuverability and Control* Warranty:  2-Year LimitedThe current Pulsonic S15 kit includes the following items:-  Oral-B Pulsonic Power Handle- One Standard Pulsonic Brush Head- One Precision Tip Brush Head- Charging Base w/ Brush Head Storage- Instruction Manual- Misc. Warranty and Registration PaperworkSetting up and using the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush couldn\'t be any easier.  The small charging base simply plugs into an available A/C outlet and sits on your countertop.  Although the instruction manual doesn\'t specifically mention anything about mounting the charging base, there are two slotted holes on the backside, which would allow for wall mounting.  Once the charging base is plugged in you simply sit the Pulsonic Power Brush handle into a recessed opening on the front of the base.  As with most rechargeable products these days, you must initially wait several hours for the device to charge before you begin using it.  The Pulsonic toothbrush requires 12 hours on the charging base before it is fully charged.  The instructions do not say anything about using the toothbrush before it is fully charged, so I guess one could try it out within an hour or two if they wished.  There are two other recessed openings on the base, to allow for storage of the included Precision Tip brush head and a spare standard brush head.  The front of the toothbrush handle has a single power/mode button and three indicator lights.  Two of the LED indicators show what cleaning mode the brush is in, when powered on (clean or sensitive), while the third LED lights up when the device is charging.  A single push of the power/mode button activates the power toothbrush in \'Clean\' mode, while a second push of the button switches the toothbrush into \'Sensitive\' mode.  Pushing the button a third time powers the toothbrush off.  Therefore, if you push the button once, and use the standard clean mode, you will need to push the button twice more in order to power the device off.Unlike the typical oscillating head type power toothbrushes that Oral-B is known for, which require the user to simply hold the head on each tooth for cleaning, this Pulsonic model requires you to move the head around in a circular motion while cleaning.  This can take a little getting used to if you are more accustomed to the oscillating brush-type models, like I am.  There is no need to scrub your teeth with the Pulsonic toothbrush.  You simply move the brush head gently over your teeth (in the aforementioned circular motion), letting the sonic vibrations perform the work of cleaning and polishing your teeth.  Although these vibrations are fairly gentle, switching to the sensitive mode reduces the strength of the vibration by about 1/3.  The vibration speed remains the same, but the intensity becomes gentler and feels less abrasive against your teeth.  While brushing, the Pulsonic toothbrush provides a short stutter (a single break in vibration), at 30-second intervals, to let you know that you are supposed to switch quadrants in your mouth.  Once you have brushed for the professionally recommended 2-minutes, a longer stutter (two breaks in vibration) can be heard and felt.  This form of tactile feedback is quite effective in keeping the user informed as to the status of their brushing session.Once you have finished brushing with the Pulsonic toothbrush, cleanup is a snap.  You simply run the brush head under water and rinse thoroughly.  To better clean the top portion of the toothbrush handle, you can easily remove the brush head attachment by turning the head counter-clockwise (about 1/4 turn) and lifting it off the handle.  The top portion of the handle can be rinsed under running water, but it is not recommended to run water over the lower, controller portion of the handle.  Reinstalling the brush head onto the handle is as simple as lowering it into place and giving about a 1/4 clockwise turn.  You will hear and feel it click into place.  Cleaning the charging base is just as easy.  Since you should never get the electrical portion of the charger base wet, Oral-B has designed the base with a removable top, which can then be cleaned under running water.  To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  After cleaning the removable portion, you can wipe the bottom portion of the base with a dry cloth.  To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  She has been using it regularly and has given me the following pros and cons for this Pulsonic model:Pros******- Extremely slim and lightweight.- Comfortable to hold and is well balanced- Very quiet operation- Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth & gums- Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth & gums- Easy to use and clean- Perfect size for travel- Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work- Charging base takes up very little space on the countertopCons*******- Charging base slides around countertop too easily- No low battery warning indicator- No indication of when charging is complete- Spare brush storage is not covered- No travel/storage case includedMy wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  She has stayed away from power toothbrushes in the past because she didn\'t like the fat handles, noisy operation, and uncomfortable brush heads.  Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  She doesn\'t like leaving the brush heads exposed, so she keeps the spares in a drawer, due to the lack of covered brush storage on the base.  She also wishes that the charging base was weighted, so that it wouldn\'t slide around on the counter so easily.  She informed me that she wants the base mounted to the wall so she doesn\'t have to continue dealing with it sliding around.Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife\'s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B\'s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  I was very tempted to give this Pulsonic toothbrush a 5-star rating, but I honestly feel that Oral-B has overlooked a few important details that will hopefully be corrected on future model releases.  First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don\'t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  The charging base either needs to be weighted or should have better griping foot pads to prevent it from sliding all over the place.  And why they don\'t have a low battery indicator on this toothbrush is anyone\'s guess.  Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  Since the Pulsonic is the perfect size for travel, including a travel case would make perfect sense.  Hopefully they will at least offer a Pulsonic travel case, as an optional accessory, in the near future.  My wife and I consider the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush a 4 and 1/2 star product, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powered brush but doesn\'t want the typical fat-handled, noisy products that have always been the norm."
1598,1639,20080904,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 4, 2008",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,The new aesthetically pleasing brush,"Before I received the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush I was using the conventional, bulky, sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare).  Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  The Pulsonic is about the same size as a manual toothbrush, which is much smaller than all electronic toothbrushes currently on the market.  This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom (even the charger is not the usual eyesore).  Now to the nitty gritty, what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  Nothing, except unwanted complexities.  The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren\'t familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  This takes the place of the usual multi-button brush with a variety of settings, only one of which you actually wind up using.  The Pulsonic comes with one standard brush head and one precision head that has a brush area about the size of a toothpick and stiffer bristles.  The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  This is designed to help you spend the right amount of time in the four quadrants of your mouth, and has always seemed silly to me, but after using it for a while I am following the routine without even thinking.  The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very \'natural,\' and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter. Overall, the brush does everything a sonic brush should, none of the things I think it shouldn\'t and it takes up less space and looks great.  The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  If you\'re looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B."
1603,1644,20080828,B001CX4JSS,3,"August 28, 2008",A1W2OYL5YAJF4C,Good but not great,"I have been using the Pulsonic Power for the last couple of weeks.  As a loyal Oral B user (Triumph 9900), I must say that my expectations were high and I was a bit disappointed by the performance of this instrument in comparison to my Triumph 9900.On the positive side is the form-factor which is fantastic, it is nearly as light weight and compact as a standard (non-electric) brush.  It is the perfect size for travel.On the negative side are the following:(1) The brush quality.  The brush quality is on-par with my earlier Oral B brush (which now retails for around $35).  Additionally, the brush head is more traditional and I tend to favor the rounded head found on most Oral B brushes.(2) The charging station.  Not nearly the high quality that I would expect.  Made from light-weight plastic, it feels cheap.(3) The price.  This product would be perfectly priced at around $45 and is a bit expensive at close to $70."

I previously used the Hydrabrush, which is very bulky and heavy with large brushes and felt uncomfortable in my mouth.  This Oral-B Pulsonic feels very comfortable in my mouth; the brush head is very small.  There are two modes, clean and sensitive, which I really like.  At first the clean mode was too strong on my teeth and I switched to the sensitive mode.  Now I\'m used to the clean mode, but use the sensitive mode behind my teeth where it\'s more gentle on my gums. It also has a very small brush head for in between teeth; somewhat like flossing. It has 30-second timers (not a beep, a hesitation) to let you know when to switch to another section of teeth if you want to.  My teeth feel very clean and tartar free after brushing.  The only reason I\'m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are NO replacement brush heads; even though it recommends replacing them every three months.  It really should include at least one set of brush heads.  All in all, a good product and I would recommend it."
1609,1651,20080828,B001CX4JSS,5,"August 28, 2008",A1JAPP1CXRG57A,You Can Never Be Too Quiet or Too Thin,"If you\'re a toothbrush, that is.Compared to the Sonicare toothbrush I own, this skinny model is uber quiet, and lacks that \'dental-drill\' whirring noise. Good for those of us who don\'t like reminders of the dentist\'s office.The slim handle is the best part, because it lets you easily turn the brush, and move it from side to side in your mouth. There\'s less \'banging\' against the teeth this way, and it\'s easier to reach all tooth surfaces.Both modes, (clean and sensitive modes) get their jobs done with a minimum of noise.The brush head is a \'standard\' size, neither too big nor too small, and fits comfortably in the mouth. Replacement heads are easy to find in retail stores (not always the case with electric brushes) and are slightly less expensive than Sonicare replacement heads.Overall, this is a great little brush. And I do mean little, as in slim. :)"
1612,1654,20080827,B001CX4JSS,5,"August 27, 2008",A2X61KKXXR6WNP,A better toothbrush,"This product is Oral-B\'s answer to the Sonicare, as both of them clean teeth using ultrasonics (tiny vibrations) instead of a more standard rotating head.  Kind of like the old vibrating toothbrushes from long ago, except the power behind this is far greater, and much more effective.Sonicare had the benefit of being first with this type of brush, but Oral-B has an advantage in that they can study the other product and make improvements on it.  I\'d say the major difference is that the Oral-B is thinner, lighter, and therefore easier to hold and maneuver around the mouth.  The replacement brushes are also less expensive on this model, which is important as they can really add up if you replace them as recommended by the manufacturer, every three months or so.I was pleased to see that toothpaste can be used with it, although if you use too much you\'ll be foaming at the mouth from the ultrasonics.  It is still pretty foamy, so I recommend staying close to the sink.The recharging base is small, attractive, and wall-mountable.  The power cord plugs into a wall outlet and doesn\'t use a transformer, so it won\'t take up additional outlets. It will hold two spare brush heads behind the toothbrush, and allows the toothbrush to be dropped in facing any direction.  So, when you are done it is an easy matter to drop the toothbrush back onto its base.It actually worked quite a bit better than I expected.  The head is fairly small, so it is easy to move around your mouth to clean each tooth.  The timer lets you know if you are rushing the job (I usually am, but at least now I can\'t pretend I don\'t know that!).  The massage mode for the brush seems like a feature that I\'ll never use, but people with tender gums that are working their way up to the full speed might like it.  I use mine on clean mode all the time and it works well.  It is somewhat annoying that both modes are accessible through the single button given that I never use the lower-speed.  It isn\'t so annoying that it is a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.I was happy with the noise level, too.  Nothing bugs me more than holding something that sounds like a buzz saw so close to my ear in the morning.  Mercifully, this brush is pretty quiet, as these things go.  It is louder than a manual brush, of course, but quieter than an electric shaver.  The pitch is a little high, but nothing I can\'t live with.Overall, I like it and would get it again.

I read the reviews and got this Braun Pulsonic - what a waste of money.  The toothbrush moves your hand more than it does in your mouth, is hard to hold, and doesn\'t clean as well.

I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I\'m lucky enough to have a window and sill.For that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don\'t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life. And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all. The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical. But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again. I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).In my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months. Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don\'t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B."

Why it took so long for me to buy an electric or battery powered toothbrush is beyond me. However, I\'m glad I finally woke-up and bought this \'Oral-B Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\', I\'ll never buy another manual toothbrush again.It\'s a Great Toothbrush. Buy it, you won\'t regret it.It comes as advertized with two AA batteries, just plug them in and you\'re ready to go. It has a neat 2 minute timer, which by the way is a long time when you actually start brushing. And that\'s a good thing.I got one tiny, insignificant gripe, it\'s hard to see the (+ -) battery polarity on the side of the toothbrush after removing the battery cap. When I installed the batteries the first time it wouldn\'t start, so I had to switch the batteries around, and now I have to remember the correct installation the next time I add new batteries. It\'s nothing to lose sleep over.Speaking of battery caps, removing the batter cap may be a slight problem for those people who suffer arthritis of the hand but it\'s do-able. You have to \'squeeze hard\' the two rubber spots on the sides, at the bottom of the toothbrush to release the battery cap. With that said, that too can be a good thing, because that means the battery compartment is airtight and waterproof.The ON/OFF switch is covered in some type of rubbery, waterproof membrane and is very responsive; quick on, quick off. The brush itself has a nice weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. Has the right amount of balance as well.The handle is made of two types of materials: rubber and a very smooth plastic, there\'s enough rubber on the handle so you don\'t have to worry about it slipping from your hands, even when wet. The package doesn\'t mention anything about what type of bristle comes with this toothbrush (i.e., soft or hard bristle), however, I felt NO irritation or discomfort what-so-ever.The overall length is 8-inches; brush head length is about 2.75-inches, width of the handle is about 1.5-inches X 1-inches.There are four different styles of toothbrush refill heads available for the \'Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\':1)Oral-B \'Precision\' Clean Brush Head (which comes with this toothbrush)2)Oral-B \'Pro White\' Replacement Brush Head3)Oral-B \'Dual Action\' Premium Power Toothbrush Head4)Oral B \'Floss Action\' Brush HeadI plan on stocking up on all 4 refills. I have all 32 of my teeth and I plan on keeping all 32 teeth, for as long as I can. And this battery powered toothbrush will definitely help me do that."

I visit my dentist every 6 months without fail (yes I have dental insurance and bi-annual cleanings are covered) and I have received nothing but praise from my dentist.I recently switched to this model becauser I became incredibly frustrated with the internal battery models dying 12 to 18 months after purchase. This was not due to mechanical failure as the build quality of this Made in Germany product is solid. However the Ni-Cad batteries cannot sustain charges well after prolonged use. I always disassemble the old brushes, remove the AA battery, and run it through a La Crosse charger using the full charge-discharge cycle which brings the battery back to life. However the disassembly of the brush does not permit for its reconstruction so all I am left with is a rechargeable AA Ni-Cad battery for use in other devices.The great thing about this brush is that it has the same great build quality but costs half the price. Additionally, it takes two AA batteries and the unit goes a week worth of brushing without charging while the internal battery models get 3 days maximum when new which slowly falls to every day before needing charging.In short, you get the same cleaning efficacy at half the cost with extended periods between charges. I am hoping that the product\'s life will also extend beyond 18 months further enhancing the benefits of this model versus any Oral-B/Braun model that can cost 10 times as much!!

Had this been sitting in a warehouse somewhere?  The rubberized materials did not respond to pressure.  The plastic end was immobile.  Pliers didn\'t help.  I thought of using my teeth as gripper, but doubted that would be good for my dental health.  I finally pried the end off with the back of a fine-bladed knife.  The interior was not marked with the customary + or - signs for the battery placement.  It appeared that the wire springs were at one end, so I inserted batteries side-by-side pointed together.  Again, Bad move!  After replacing the end piece with difficulty, of course the appliance would not turn on.  Then I found a one sentence instruction of how to place the batteries -- on a corner of cardboard inner packaging.  Well done, Oral-B -- you hid that quite successfully!

So for one, it was a good deal at a post-rebate of $54.99.This was a perfect set-up for my husband and me. It came with a floss head and I already had a whitening brush head.

The timer display also shows what mode you are like normal or gentle and if you are brushing too hard.The brush has been working well for both my husband and I. The brush does make noise, and since there is not doorseparating our sink from the bedroom, I do have to go into the enclosed toilet/ bathtub room to brush when my husband is sleeping. Also, there is only one brush so you either have to brush one after another or use another oral-B professional brush, which we already had (the Professional 1000).My husband dentist thanked him for flossing (which he doesn\'t), and my dentist said that my gums looked a lot healthier and my teeth were very white. My dentist even is going to order me 2 new brush heads every time I come in (about every 6 months) instead of the standard toothbrush.I would recommend this brush to everyone.

There are youtube videos that demonstrate hack jobs requiring the user to break the seals and remove solder points and circuit board components, but I don\'t consider that to be a user friendly service by any means. This is a serious design flaw that one might suspect as being intentional (a battery costs about twenty bucks, but Braun/Oral-B would probably rather sell a whole new system for over a hundred bucks). This also makes it difficult to recycle the battery apart from the rest of the plastic and electronics.

I can\'t get that with any other electric or non-electric toothbrush. The better a product is, the harder I evaluate it and the more nit-picky I become, so here go the suggested improvements: First, the recommended cleaning time is 2 minutes which I believe is way too short. I double that by brushing the lower and upper jaw, each using the times for my entire mouth. Last, the controls are too easy to accidentally hit. This causes the toothbrush to go into another cleaning mode when you didn\'t want it to. I don\'t know how you can fix this except to be careful when holding the toothbrush and not accidentally hit one of the two buttons on the handle. I imagine if they located the controls elsewhere, or made them more difficult to press, I would be complaining about the ergonomics! Maybe a lockout on the end of the brush would help?

Also, I like that it warns you if you are pushing too hard.  I got it, in part, because my dentist said I was brushing too hard.  You just barely hold on to this and let it do all of the work.  It also warns you if you are pressing too hard.3. It comes with a very handy travel case, so you could travel with it and two different heads.4.

I use the gentle mode most often, and I wish I didn\'t have to hit the mode button each time I start it to get to that mode.  That being said, it\'s very simple to do and a habit not.

It feels much cleaner, and although i didn\'t believe it at first, my teeth are getting white because the brush is lifting the stains out. I decided to purchase this brush and not a Sonic Care because 1. There was a 50% off rebate for this and 2. I have a small mouth, so the brush head was perfect for me. I love the brush heads, there are so many offered, and i can find them at most, if not all drug stores. I was hesitant at first on purchasing this, but i thought about the investment and teeth so i have no regrets. Although this brush sounds like it will jack hammer your gums and teeth away, i got used to it pretty fast. My gums did bleed a bit, but that was expected. Now they look and feel much healthier. Although i thought the smart guide was just a little \'buy me i\'m unnecessary\' kind of device, i find it pretty helpful especially for a first time user like myself. It\'s cute, and pretty cool, i plan to keep using it. All in all, i love this product, and throwing down 1 bill, wasn\'t bad at all compared to the pros that will come out of all of this.

It arrived within 7 days and I\'ve been using it ever since.  I originally had planned on purchasing a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush but after reading many different reviews, decided on the Oral-B instead.  The clock/timer is a nice feature, makes me more aware of how much time I spend on different sections of teeth.  The motor hesitates when too much pressure is applied which is also a plus for me as I have a tendency to press too hard.  I\'ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don\'t use the stand that it came with but it\'s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn\'t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I\'ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.

From the first time I brushed with this Oral B 5000, I was astonished at how clean my teeth felt.  I honestly think they felt even cleaner than when I would have them cleaned at the dentist.  I even find myself brushing a third time some days, just for the great feeling.  My only disappointment with the unit is that I didn\'t clearly understand it only came with one brush head.  My husband utilized that Floss Head while I waited a few days for our set of 4 Precision Clean Brush Heads came in.  (I think that the floss head would have been too large for my mouth, so I did not order those for us.)  Using the simple Precision Clean heads, my mouth feels terrific.  While I have had gum problems in the past, I find less bleeding with this brush than my manual toothbrush which I had been using.  As some others have noted, my teeth are markedly whiter in perhaps only a week of use, with my usual whitening toothpaste I will add.  I do like the little remote timer.  I thought it more for my kids, but I truly like seeing the time rack up.  I now think I will be using the Deep Cleaning (3 minute) setting as I am never quite done with each quadrant before it beeps and pauses to alert me.  I am unsure how the whitening (pulsing mode) helps, but I use it after a full brushing, and it certainly isn\'t hurting.  My family of four is now happily using this unit.

At first I thought it was crazy to spend about $120.00 on a toothbrush, but I\'m glad I did. I was probably like alot of you who used the regular toothbrushes that only cost about $3.00 or so.  About a month ago my dentist asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  Told him just a plain jane toothbrush which I switch out every 3 months or so.  He recommended that I purchase an electric one because he\'s a firm believer in them.  He told me what kind he had, which was the Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable made by Oral-B.  He said there are several different price ranges, styles, and brands.  One of the many features I like on mine is the wireless SmartGuide which has a personalizing timer on it.  This helps you brush all four quadrants of your mouth equally. 5 brushing modes- Daily Clean, Sensative, Massage, Whitening, and Deep Clean.  It also has an idicator that lights up when too much pressure is being applied, this is a great feature because I was brushing too hard with my regular toothbrush which caused my gums to bleed.  Since I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 I haven\'t had any problems with it, no bleeding gums, and my teeth feel as though I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  If there is a Con it would be that I had to purchase the precision clean head seperately because it only comes with the floss action and ProWhite heads.  However you also get a 5.00 off coupon to save money on your additional heads you might purchase.  Over all I\'m more than happy with the product and Amazon.com didn\'t waste anytime getting it sent to me.  I hope this helps any possible future buyers. Semper FI"

It takes a few days to get used to not using the same rigorous back and forth brushing action, but you get used to it. The secret is in the reciprocating action that allows the brush to get between teeth in ways a normal brush cannot. It also cleans those tough back molars extremely well. The included charger is also 110-220v which is a nice feature for someone who travels a lot and lives in Europe like myself. I was also a little apprehensive about the wireless timer/clock, but after using it for awhile it makes a lot of sense and I like using it. I wish they would include an alarm clock or multiple timezones in future iterations to make it more travel friendly and usable. If there were any downside to this toothbrush it would be in it\'s travel \'footprint\'. Although the case is very nice and holds the brush and two heads, its much larger than a regular brush and will take up more space while traveling. The additional wireless timer adds additional packing requirements (which is why I recommend that they add some more features to the clock to make it more usable and travel friendly). If you don\'t travel much, then the size will be fine for your bathroom and the included stand is nice, functional, and compact. Overall, I strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to bring their oral hygiene to the next level. It\'s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but I guarantee your teeth will feel considerably cleaner and look whiter after using it for only a week or two. Great product!"

I decided on this model because it had the separate timer - something I had come to really miss on my older model. It had the timer on the handle only, making it impossible to check during operation. And while it buzzed after each 30-second segment was up, I often didn\'t really remember whether it had already buzzed to signal that the full two minutes had been reached and kept brushing longer than that.But it turned out that the separate timer on the Oral-B 5000 is all around tedious to operate. First, one has to remove the timer stand, then the battery cover because the buttons to set the timer are hidden underneath the cover. Whether this was a misguided attempt at keeping the design minimalist I don\'t know. But having to fumble with this already didn\'t work for me - I can\'t help but wonder: What were they thinking?In the end, the timer never worked anyway - it is set to demo mode when one takes it out of the box, and the buttons in the battery compartment also serve to set it up for regular operation. Trouble was that my timer could not be reset to normal operation. It kept cycling through demo mode time and again until I gave up and returned the whole thing.As to the toothbrush itself, it seemed to work great, just as I was used to from the previous model (and the only reason I gave this 3 stars at all). But since I had gotten this particular one because of the timer, I decided to order the 4000 model instead and just put up with the timer in the handle - at least I know this will work.One last word: My old Oral-B toothbrush came with a nice, very sturdy fabric case. This one in contrast has a rather flimsy plastic travel case. Another disappointment. My conclusion: Too expensive for what it offers."

I wouldn\'t pay 100 something dollars for a toothbrush but since Oral B had a 50 percent rebate I jumped at the chance to buy this toothbrush. It promotes positive teeth brushing and even gives you a smiley face after you are done for a job well done. After awhile my teeth feel cleaner and breathe is fresher. I like how it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me to brush my teeth and the travel case is a nice addition too. If you are looking for a toothbrush then look no further this is the one for you.My only grip is how expensive the brushes are I always try and look for specials or deals so I don\'t end up spending to much per a brush head. I also feel the battery life on mine doesn\'t last as long as I would like it to. I think on a full charge the battery light would flash after a week and a half which i feel is a little to short but its not a big deal. Get this toothbrush.

Since the dentist reported some \'sensitive\' areas to watch, that had not been brushed as thoroughly, I decided to take the plunge and invest in this toothbrush. The toothbrush comes with a charger and clock/timer for each of your cleaning sessions. This not only monitors how long you are cleaning, but, has a little red light that is illuminated when you are brushing too hard. What\'s more, once you have reached the two minute mark, a smiley face appears on the digital timer. So helpful! I look forward to following up with my dentist in six months, to track my progress. Once you have been brushing with this toothbrush, diligently, for three weeks, plaque is supposed to diminish. I am already feeling that my teeth are cleaner, compared to brushing with a \'manual\' brush alone.  Well done, Oral-B."

After using this brush you will never be able to go back to manual brushes. It is worth the price. If the price is too steep, go with a lower model. You don\'t really need a timer to tell you how long  to brush or different brushing modes. So if money is tight save a few bucks and go with a lower model."

I have always used a standard toothbrush and floss and it must have worked pretty well because I have no cavities!However, I will never use another type of toothbrush after using this one...the battery lasts approximately 1 1/2 weeks with two uses each day. It comes with two different heads, charging station, brush and timer. The recommended brushing time is 2 minutes with this set-up; it is amazing how clean my teeth feel afterwards! I have no plaque buildup, but floss for good measure anyway. :)I was so convinced about the effectiveness of this toothbrush that I bought my husband one for Christmas. Needless to say, he\'s in love, too!The only complaint I have is with both of us brushing our teeth at the same time, our timers malfunction. This is really a very small concern, considering the brush \'pulses\' every 30 seconds, reminding you to switch sides."

We\'ve used Oral-B sonic for 5 years, and 5000 for 1 year.Cleanness (draw):- Both cleans well. However, they cannot remove 100% dirt from the teeth, given they use two different ways to clean. (5000 is left-right, and Sonic is up-down). It really depends on where the dirt is hiding. I would say Sonic does a better job to clean the front teeth, and 5000 does a better to job to clean the teeth in the back.Power (5000):- 5000 wins. However, it may take 1 week for your body to adjust to the strong power.Timer (5000):- 5000 comes with a timer, which is very nice.Brush head design (Sonic):- We found that the brush of 5000 wears out much faster than Sonic. I guess it has something to do with the strong power of 5000.- One thing I hate about 5000 is the brush head design. There is a hole below the brush head, which capture the toothpaste when brushing. You cannot remove it without removing the brush head. If you leave the tooth brush standing, the toothpaste inside will get out, and eventually accumulate at the bottom of the brush. This creates a round mark in our sink. To solve this problem, we need to remove the brush head and clean it completely. We didn\'t have this problem with Sonic.Battery power (Sonic)- We don\'t charge the brush until the power is completely drained. Normally, the battery of Sonic lasts about 7 days, while 5000 lasts about 3-4 days. However, it takes about 18 hours to charge Sonic, while it takes less than 12 hours to charge 5000Other uses (Sonic)- We like to use the brush head to clean the tongue. Sonic wins.Overall, we like the Sonic better."

Wasn\'t the LCD display on the brush itself good enough? The wireless display is a joke in my opinion considering it is not even back-lit. Secondly, the battery is HORRIBLE for this brush. It takes minimum 14-16 hours to re-charge it and it doesn\'t even last for more than 3 days. I had a sonicare toothbrush before and battery lasted for 15 days and got charged within 6 hours. The dual-action head is so BIG that a normal person can\'t even fit the brush in his mouth. I would expect lot more things if I am paying this much for just a toothbrush."

2168,2218,20110221,B002HWS9GG,5,"February 21, 2011",AN81JUYW2SL24,It\'s like your personal dentist! Been an Oral B user for over a decade,"Oral B SmartSeries 5000The Oral B 5000 is the top of the line electric toothbrush. I used to have an older Oral B from the late 1990s that worked well up until the point where I couldn\'t find it around my house. The Ni-Accu battery pack was running strong and I could have used it for another 5-10 years. Then I got a few Oral B Vitality units from the dentist for free, which use inferior Ni-Cd batteries and have a battery life of about 3-5 days with regular usage. My old Oral B could last 3 weeks on a single charge.The cool aspect of these Oral B units is that a lot of their brushes are compatible. The Precision Clean, Sensitive, Polishing, and new Floss Action are interchangeable with a few exceptions  (like the Cross/Dual action garbage). The Floss Action worked horribly in my Vitality, but seems to work incredibly well with this SmartSeries 5000. I think it has to do with the RPM/speed of the motor. The Vitality comes across as grindy/noisy when it is operating, while the SmartSeries 5000 is smoother and faster.While brushing in the Daily Cleaning or Sensitive modes with the 5000, the Floss Action brush really works to clean my teeth and gumline. It doesn\'t hurt like it did with the Vitality! The Precision Clean brushes are probably the de-facto standard, but I invite you to try the Floss Action heads just to see how it feels. I also have the Sensitive brush heads that I want to try later on. I can tell you for a fact that my teeth felt cleaner brushing with the same Floss Action head on the Smart Series 5000 versus using the Vitality or a regular tooth brush.What does the Smart Series 5000 offer over other brushes? Well, the 5000 has a LCD indicator on the unit itself to tell you the battery\'s state of charge. Neat gimmick, but I have wondered in the past whether my toothbrush was good to go in terms of state of charge. Wonder no more, because you get a bar graph indicator!The 5000 has 2 buttons: one to turn on/off and another to select different cleaning modes. It defaults to daily cleaning (same as Deep Cleaning), and progresses to feather/sensitive, massaging, polishing, and deep clean. The Deep Clean changes the timer to increase the amount of time for your brushing, but it is the same speed as the daily cleaning mode. The timer defaults to counting up, and fluctuates the brush head speed every 30 seconds to tell you to switch quadrants in your mouth, and does the typical Oral B twitch at 2 minutes to tell you that you\'re done.The wireless timer/clock module is a neat gimmick offered on the 5000 and not the 4000. I don\'t find that it is particularly mandatory, but It does have a clock and changes to a timer when you use the brush. It also lights up a red LED if you press too hard on the brush head while brushing. While experimenting, I found that you really had to jam down on the brush head to cause it to cut power to the brush. Chances are you\'re not brushing hard with an Oral B because you want the RPM\'s to do the work with the brush. I tried SonicAire and other products, including Oral B\'s cross-action, but found the traditional Oral B to be the ultimate.The Smart Series 5000 comes with 1 Floss action head and 1 polishing head. The bristles are also indicators, you\'re supposed to change them when the blue color disappears halfway down. I find that this generally occurs every 6 months, and you can order new heads from Amazon for a lot less than buying them in stores (usually).The Smart Series 5000 also comes with a plastic hard travel case, and a slim charger unit that is more of a ring than a peg like on the older models. This makes cleaning a lot easier. The included battery is a NiMH cell, which means it has a much higher capacity than NiCd and doesn\'t suffer the memory effect. I am going to keep the Vitality as a travel brush, so if someone from the hotel nicks the Vitality, it\'s not a big loss.The Smart Series 5000 is a very smart investment for your personal dental hygiene. I brush with Oral B at least once a day (at night before I go to sleep). My dentist and hygienist always mention how clean my teeth and gums look, so the Oral B must be doing its job!Overall: 5/5 starsUPDATE: 4 MAR 2011After running the Oral B Smart Series 5000 without charging it, I noticed that I can easily get 10 days of normal routine usage (2-3 times a day for 1 person) before the battery meter starts blinking with 1 bar remaining. I used it for about 12 days and estimate I can get another 2-3 days before the battery is totally drained. As someone that travels routinely for business, I can opt to not bring my charger along for week long trips because I know the battery can last at the least 10 days before needing a charge. I\'d push it as far as 15 days!UPDATE: 19 NOV 2011I decided to push the Oral B 5000 as long as possible without charging it to see what would happen. After 22 days, it was still running fairly strong. I can detect a decrease in RPM because the voltage is probably too low. So that is roughly 44-60 minutes of total run time. It will easily handle most business travels without lugging around the charger. I noted that the low battery icon started flashing after 9 days of usage or roughly 18-20 minutes of operation, but it kept running and was still running after a total of 22 days on a single charge."

2187,2237,20110128,B002HWS9GG,4,"January 28, 2011",A2T7P7ZL7RLGB7,Good Product,"I am a first time electric toothbrush user.  But, according to my hygienist, I am a plaque producing maniac so it was suggested to me by her that I get one of these things.  The initial price shocked me but with the rebate, I could swallow spending a net of $50 on a toothbrush.  So far, I like it.  Not sure why anyone would \'need\' the little timer/clock thing that comes with it and I wouldn\'t suggest anyone spend extra money to have this feature. I have banished mine to a drawer as I do not have unlimited space in my bathroom. The toothbrush itself is a little bulky, but after a week or so, you get used to it. One of the features I do really love is the vibrate indicator.  After 30 seconds, it vibrates to tell you to move on to the next quadrant in your mouth.  What I am astounded by however (and kicking myself in the butt over) is the price of replacement heads.  I never thought to check on that before I bought this.  It costs about $25 for a 3 pack or about $12 for a single.  Also, I have yet to find a 3 pack that is a multi pack (i.e. different heads).  So, if you are like me, and use both the polishing and cleaning head, just using this toothbrush will cost about $9 every month to replace the heads.  As for how well it cleans...I am a smoker and a coffee drinker. I am also obsessed with clean teeth so I get mine cleaned by my hygienist every 3 months.  My teeth feel cleaner since using this toothbrush and if this toothbrush allows me to expand my dentist visits to every 6 months, the cost of the unit and replacement heads will be worth every penny (as I have to pay out of pocket for 2 cleanings a year b/c insurance only covers a cleaning every 6 months)If not, then I will be happy feeling as though I have cleaner teeth but will check this purchase off as a luxury and a \'want\', not a need. One other thing that I would like to point out is that, if, like me, you have limited bathroom space and outlets, this toothbrush is wonderful b/c you only have to charge it once a week. I was very concerned over where this unit was going to \'live\' as I need my bathroom plugs for my hairdryer and flat iron.  I do not leave the base sitting out and I do not constantly charge it. I keep the toothbrush in a drawer in the case (which is very nice) it comes with and simply charge it overnight every sunday."

(2) when accidentally tapping the back of the brush on your tooth, it is not as \'jarring\'.  (3) auto-pause feature when applying too much pressure;  i have been over aggressive on the gums when brushing manually.*WHY YOU COULD LIVE WITH SERIES 1000:i bought this 5000 at a good price driven by an impulsive \'get the most expensive/best\' psyche.  honestly, (1) the timer is useless, i usually brush from 2-3 minutes regardless.  (2) the different modes (massage, gentle, extra clean) are useless.  its like buying a sports car with a \'comfort\' and \'luxury\' suspension settings--do you ever switch it to those?

Now like I said, I\'ve never used one before, so maybe they\'re all loud.  When I say it\'s really big I mean the base part of the toothbrush that you hold on to.  It\'s very thick/wide and is weird when holding in your hand.  My in-laws have electric toothbrushes that are much thinner, but I don\'t think they\'re as high-end as these.I\'m wondering if the additional thickness is from a better battery in this model because the battery lasts quite a while before you have to recharge it.Overall, I think this toothbrush is very good for even the normal price.

Now that it is set correctly I have no complaints (and having a clock on my sink is an added and welcome feature)."
2228,2279,20101223,B002HWS9GG,5,"December 23, 2010",AM86MLL3L424C,Best Electric Toothbrush Yet!,"I\'ve been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for 3 years now starting with the 3D. The difference was immediate. My first visit to the hygienist after two months use astounded her. She told me she had allowed an hour for my cleaning as the calculus buildup on my teeth had been graded C on my visit 6 months previously. She said it was now an A, and was finished in 20 minutes(No discount). She was impressed that the only difference was an Oral B electric with the floss brush-head. As for the 5000 the difference is noticeable. Much longer battery life. Where the 3D was good for 3 minutes and then needed an hour charge. The 5000 will go at least 5 minutes with full power. Probably more. I got bored and ended my experiment after 5 minutes. I also like the fact it is only high speed with a 30 second pulse. I never saw the need for a slower speed option. The 5000 also has an open charging stand, eliminating the gunk buildup the 3D was prone to, and taking less counter space. As for the clock, I have no idea what it\'s for. Set up is simple. Just plug in the charger and set the brush on. The display will let you know when you\'re ready to go. And best of all you can\'t screw it up. The battery will hold a full charge whether you brush 1 minute or 5. No worries about running it down to achieve full charge like many cell phones. I don\'t think you\'ll be disapointed with the 5000."

Now to the point...- Quality of the cleaning - My first impression is that the feeling it leaves after you use the brush is slick and clean.  Im usually the type to brush when I can and I do religiously.  I feel this product does the job well and faster than using a manual toothbrush.- Charge - The charge last pretty much exactly what it says.  Depending how often you use it (I use mine twice-morning and night) It lasts about 10-14 days.- Timer -The quadrant timer is something that is useful as well.  I like how it \'paces\' you through the brushing.  There are times when my mind wanders and with this it gives a little pause in the vibrations to prompt you to go to the next quadrant in your mouth.- Durability -Its been about 5 or 6 months since I\'ve purchased it and it doesnt seem to have any durability issues.  When spending any more money for a high dollar item this is a concern for me.- Sound - The sound is a little bit louder than the Sonicare, but it wasn\'t a big concern for me.Overall, it was a choice between this and the Sonicare line, and I went with this after lots of research.  I like how this comes with a nice travel case so for the trips it is easy to store.  Many of the Sonicare products that is in the same price range did not.  Also the replacement heads for the brush are cheaper with the Oral B (more options to pick also)and it might not be a big deal to everyone, but I\'m sure the cost all adds up after years of use.  With all that aside, I\'m very happy with the product, because of the quality of cleaning. It says 2 minutes for a total clean, but I go the 2 minutes plus an extra 45-60 seconds and I get a better clean than manually brushing for 5 minutes plus.  I never had a \'break in\' time to have my gums adjust, which some people might need, but it was fine and gentle enough for me.  Ill never go back to manual toothbrushes again."

2237,2289,20101213,B002HWS9GG,5,"December 13, 2010",A2CCL5RDYG0X5N,Great rechargeable toothbrush,"I think most people would agree that the 2 minutes spent brushing your teeth are the longest 2 minutes in the day, however many times per day you brush.Dentists insist that I use an electric toothbrush, otherwise I brush too hard and add to gum recession.  Most dentists put the Oral B\'s at the top of the list, and I\'ve been very pleased with them, but this new one is a leap forward.All because of a simple improvement: it not only divides the mouth into quadrants and gives a little shake to prompt me to move from one quadrant to another, but it has a separate wireless display.  When the brush isn\'t in use, the display serves as a darned good digital clock, and when brushing, it converts into a timer and a map of the four quadrants, depicting which quadrants have been brushed.  Then, once the two minutes have passed, the round quadrant display turns into a smiling face, which grins if you\'ve really been brushing enough.And it\'s the darndest thing, but breaking it up into 4 quadrants not only shortens the perceived brushing time dramatically, but I for one--yes, it\'s embarrassing but true--actually want to \'please\' the display, and get that silly smiley face.  Worse than that, I want to get the big grin on the smiley face!No, I\'m not lonely, I have a lovely girlfriend who brushes right beside me, but we both find that these Oral B\'s turn the longest 2 minutes of the day into an all too short game that seems to last at most 30 seconds.  And the cavity-free dental exams are nice, too.The only negative point: as is the case with all previous Oral B electric toothbrushes I\'ve owned, after even a single brushing it seems to take impossibly long to completely recharge.  I don\'t have any other rechargeable appliance that comes close.  It\'s not much of a problem, but it does seem peculiar."

In the early 80s I had gum surgery because of it. I\'m supposed to go to the dentist every four months for a cleaning, but of course I don\'t go to the dentist near that often; maybe once a year if I\'m lucky. Anyway I always have a large plaque buildup when I finally do go to the dentist for a cleaning. The last several times I\'ve gone to the University of Pittsburgh school of dentistry where dental hygiene students do the work and the instructors check their work and correct the cleaning if necessary. Anyway I\'ve never had better cleanings in my life, but I still get severe plaque between cleanings. The last time I went the instructor recommended the Oral B 5000 toothbrush for my plaque problem. I thought I\'d give it a try and to say I\'m pleased is an understatement. I\'ve been using it now for five weeks after my last cleaning and as of yet I can feel no plaque buildup on my teeth. In the past by this time after a cleaning the plaque was starting to form when I used a regular toothbrush. I use the included timer and clean my teeth for a total of about 2 1/2 minutes. The feature I like is that you can get the molars clean. This was always a problem area for me in the past. Also the toothbrush will slowdown or stop if you press too hard. After a week or so you know what kind of pressure to apply and hone your cleaning technique. I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has a plaque or gum problem. One final note; I don\'t keep the charger plugged in all the time. I charge the toothbrush and can use it for eight or nine days before recharging. I\'m old school on this and feel the battery will last much longer if not charging all the time. I might be wrong on this, but I know at the very least it won\'t hurt battery life."

I don\'t know if newer Sonicare toothbrushes have a different design. I used the Sonicare Elite for many years until the nickel-cadmium battery died. I didn\'t notice the inferior design of the Sonicare until I started using the Oral-B 5000. The Sonicare has fat plastic at the brush end which is not as comfortable as the slim Oral-B brush head. The Sonicare has a fat and elaborate interface between the base and the removable brushing unit, which is not as easy to keep clean as the slim and simple interface of the Oral-B. And the Oral-B brushing part of the two types of brush included in the box does a better cleaning job. Finally, we have battery disposal. The Sonicare has a non-removable Ni-Cad battery, so that in order to dispose of it properly at a recycling center I had to cut the base to access the battery. The Oral-B has a provision for removing the nickel-metal hydride battery (better than Ni-Cad), although the manufacturer wants you to stop using the unit when the battery dies, not to replace it."

I\'ve been a fan of oral B products ever since I was 18. I first bought the regular manual toothbrush and wasn\'t satisfied. I then bought the oral B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush, used it for about a month, and stopped. From then on I stayed using the man�al brush and was silent for about 3 years.

Make sure it\'s fully charged before first use and every full charge will last you at least a week depending on how often you brush.I think it\'s a very good investment for your dental hygiene and replacement heads dont seem to be too costly if you buy it from Amazon as well or go to Costco or BJ\'s to get them at a slightly lower price than retail stores.

Any retail store you go to this is going to be around $140-$160.I will start with the pros. The first time I started using the Oral B 5000 toothbrush I noticed how clean my teeth felt after brushing. I have been using this product for over a month now and love the pressure sensor. That is the main reason why I bought this product is because I have a habit of brushing hard. It has 4 dedicated modes which are great and one mode with extended time. I switch modes pretty much every time I use it. My teeth are getting slightly whiter after a month. The wireless brushing guide/clock is really handy so you can see what mode you are on and how much time you have been brushing. The charging base is great and very portable compared to other models.Now the cons. There are only a few things that I can think of that aren\'t that great with this toothbrush. The display mode on the handle really bugs me. It just displays the battery and nothing else. This is pretty pointless especially when you travel. Because it doesn\'t tell you which mode you are in so you have to go by feel to figure which mode you want. The display of the battery is so large it makes me wonder how much battery it drains to display that thing because its always on. That brings me to my next point is the life of the battery. It says in the manual that the life is 10 days. But seems to be less than that. My girlfriend has the 4000 and hers lasts longer than mine. Her display is for the battery is smaller and in the corner of the display instead of enourmous and in the middle.

My husband also got the same brush, just not with the SmartGuide. He doesn\'t mind that he doesn\'t have one (the Oral-B rep told us over the phone that the model just below this one would still be compatible with the SmartGuide but it isn\'t) but admits that it would be nice. My mouth feels so nice after I brush. I actually used a regular toothbrush the other day after using my Oral-B for a few weeks because I just needed to brush for 30 seconds and run.

As I could not find more details from other reviews (maybe I missed) based on how I plan to use it. I\'ll focus the review on that front. I thought the SmartGuide is very helpful as the kids can clearly see the progress and stay on the brushing until 2 min. is reached. I\'m glad to report that it works as planned perfectly. As an adult, it is easier to manage the discipline on how long you should brush your teeth. However, my kids constantly want to get off the process and it is painful to calm them down and persuade them to go further. With the SmartGuide clearly showing the progress and how far you are away from the \'smiling face\', it helps managing the expectation excellently.Now get the details on how the SmartGuide works for our use. Each 5000 comes with one SmartGuide, and you can use just one for more than one toothbrushes. However, the manual also provides you instructions on how to make each SmartBuide dedicate to individual toothbrush if it is what you desired. I bought two together, and found that both SmartGuide will respond to signal coming from each toothbrush as the way I received them. Since I don\'t want to put two SmartGuides in one bathroom, I don\'t need to reconfigure anything.The SmartGuide function is very simple. It automatically receive the signal from the 5000 toothbrush as you start brushing. If you stop in the middle, the time counting will pause then resume when you continue. If you wait longer, (not sure exact, maybe 30 sec or longer), it will reset itself. Everything is automatic, there is no manual button to start or stop time counting, therefore it can not be a timer for anything else besides 5000. For the extra SmartGuide that I do not plan to put in the same bathroom with the toothbrushes, I use it as a clock in the other bathroom; it looks nice though.I don\'t have much to say on other fronts. Overall, it is an excellent purchase for young children.Charlie"

There\'s a timer that more functional, showing intensity of your brushing and you can set it for a 3-minute cycle, instead of the standard 2-minute cycle.I can not recommend a better toothbrush to anyone that cares about the health of the their teeth and gums!"

My last electric tooth brush wasn\'t as popular and I would have to go to multiple stores in order to find a replacement head.  I definitely recommend this toothbrush."

The battery just died on mine after 2 years and I couldn\'t be bothered to break out the soldering iron to replace it so I ordered a new \'handle\' for $62 shipped (toothbrush base minus the charger and brush tips.) I would skip 5000 with the Smartguide LCD and get the 4000 series instead. The LCD is a seriously useless gimmick IMO since the brush beeps every 30 seconds to let you know to move onto the next section. If you can live with expense ($40-45 a year) these brushes are great and, if it saves one costly dental procedure, it pays for itself."

I\'ve used an Oral-B for almost 10 years.  I get many compliments on my smile, even from strangers.I debated between this model and the lower model, opting to purchase this one because of the readout and extra brushing mode.  Honestly I could have saved the extra money and easily done without the added features.  The Whitening mode just makes the motor pulse in a different pattern - quite irrelevant as far as whitening your teeth.  As for the readout, it looks nice, is water resistant,  and has a clock built-in that displays when not brushing one\'s teeth.  I find I don\'t really look at it other than for the clock.

I\'ve always had severe gum problems and have had many gum grafts.  Until it dawned on me that I\'m still having gum problems so I switched to a new Periodontist who informed me that the Sonicare was tearing up all my gum grafts that were done.  He highly recommended the Oral B.  So I switched and what a huge difference.  It goes around the tooth which is what their instruments do at the dentist.  After using it for a almost 3 months, I can see a huge difference!  My gums and teeth feel clean but not all tore up.  I can\'t wait to go back to the Periodontist and show him the difference in my whole mouth.  The ORal B 5000 has a little digital clock that shows you when you\'re brushing too hard which has made a big difference in the way I brush and a 30 second timer to show you when to switch quadrants.  I\'ve always thought that really scrubbing my teeth was the way to go but not so! This brush shows you how to do it right.  I\'m excited about my new findings as I\'m spent so much time, money and pain in improving my gums. I feel for the first time, I\'m getting it right!"

(You still have to keep up the flossing, though!) I thought that the little clock/brushing guide would just be a useless gimmick, but I have actually found it helpful (it flashes a red warning if you use to much pressure on the brush, which lots of people tend to do). The brush performs beautifully, does what it\'s supposed to do effectively, and you can feel the results immediately. The smaller brush size is really great for accessing hard-to-reach places.

The main thing that made me purchase it was that it had an indicator (on the clock/timer) that let you know if you were brushing your teeth too hard. I was told by my dentist to stop brushing so hard (slightly receeding gumline) and this toothbrush has helped me tremendously. My teeth have never felt more clean and I am no longer having sensitivity issues. It makes me feel like I have just had a cleaning at the dental office. It seems a bit pricey at first but I have always been able to find the brushheads cheaper than manual toothbrushes so it makes up for it in the long run. I highly recommend using the sensitive brushhead if you have sensitive teeth and receeding gums. This toothbrush is amazing, try it!"

I recently upgraded from a very old Oral-B electric brush and am quite pleased with the extended features of this new top-line model. I considered switching to a sonic type system but was dismayed at the variety of brush heads that are not interchangeable among the leading brand\'s models. Oral-B brushes are backward and forward compatible between models which means all the spare heads I had on hand work perfectly well with the new 5000. Anyway, it works very well in all modes and I like the ability to keep four different type brushes on the stand. The visual cues, timers and cleaning modes are very handy. The only drawback to this unit is the grotesquely large charger plug which measures 3.5\' long (excluding the prongs!). Seriously? What designer/engineer thought that was a good idea? There must be a way to achieve a charge without a such a titanic plug, like building the charging guts into the stand for example. I resorted to buying a low-profile 3\' extension cord and hiding the mondo-plug behind a countertop tissue box holder."

I like the timmer which shows me if I am cheating and if I am using to much pressure.  The best part was I went to a dentist on March 24 after using the brush for about 3.5 month. The dentist told me I had very little tartar and my teeth were the best this month out of his patients.  My teeth were scrapped for less then 5 minutes compared to a hour due to this toothbrush.

It\'s either broken, or really difficult to set, as the \'set\' button won\'t depress and the clock keeps blinking at 12:00 p.m.  I don\'t like that it\'s separate from the toothbrush, it\'s just one more thing to take up space.

The timer and pressure warning feature are nice and the brush is much easier to keep clean than the Sonicare I used to use.  The only negative comment I can think of is that the brush head might be a little big for some people; I found brushing around my back molars a little difficult.

Those were the two top reasons why I purchased this product.  I knew I wanted to purchase an Oral-B.  I ordered the Oral-B 5000 Sunday 9-20, it was shipped 9-21 and I recieved it 9-25.  The order came from TeethNthings.  The product was packed ok but I received it banged up.  The postal worker wanted to blame it on poor packaging but it was packaged fine.  The product itself was fine.I have been using this product for a couple of days now so I must report that I am overall very happy and satisfied with it.  I read over the instructions twice, and when I used it for the first time, I was puzzled when I felt it doing small pauses.  The instructions are ok.  They could have broken it down dummy-style for some of us but oh well.  I was a bit confused about how to set the timing part, but I figured it out.  It could have been the excitement.If you buy this product, it will do these short pulses every two minutes.  After two minutes of brushing, the smiley comes up and winks.  So cute.  If you reach 4 minutes of brushing, it will do the pulse thing again.  There is a DVD that comes with it to explain their brushing technique of using the brush.  They break it down in 4 quadrants, 30 second intervals, two get in at least 2 minutes of brushing.The toothbrush itself is a tad bit noisier and heavier than my old ancient basic one, but let me tell you, boy does it go.  I feel like my teeth are getting a serious dental treatment, Spa Dente\'.  I don\'t know what this toothbrush will leave for the dentist to do, besides exrays.  To switch between the different brushing styles, you will push the triangle button while the brush is on.  The detached screen thing will tell you.  I use it in sensitive mode.  If you are brushing too hard, it will flash red.  Be careful not to push it while brushing, as it would seem easy to do.I really really love how they have the charger.  It is small and not bulky, which is perfect for travel.  Pretty smart how they did that.  The charger base is your travel base as well.  I really really love the blue travel case that it comes with so you can store two brush heads.  That is so neat.The best thing about this toothbrush is that it really gets your teeth, gums and mouth clean.  The smell of my breath has improved also.  It does a wonderful job.

I also love the display that shows how much time is left and whether you are brushing too hard.  My only complaint is that the battery has deteriorated greatly after only a year.  I conditioned the battery properly, so this really shouldn\'t have happened.  The battery cannot be easily replaced, hence the full brush disposal instructions they give you.  I don\'t consider a $100 toothbrush a yearly disposable item, but I guess oral-b does.  Still, the clean teeth feeling is worth it."

I tried to set it up again, but alas, same problem.I finally called up the customer care at Oral B and told them about this problem. They said that you have just completed the 60 day warranty period and now nothing can be done. When i asked them what can i do to get this fixed, they recommended visiting a service center. I also tried changing the battery but it did not help.Conclusion: good toothbrush, bad smartguide - i liked the feedback from the same when it used to work.

I have owned each for about 8 months now and I have to say that each brush has its own pros/cons and this is her favorite.  The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior/interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes some adjustment on the part of the operator.  I found that my gums could handle the Sonicare, but my girlfriend gums are more sensitive and she uses this Oral-B exclusively.  The motion of the brush is much more softer and the replaceable brushes tend to fit right over each tooth.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  I like having the ability to brush my tongue which is much more difficult with this brush."

I have always loved these brushes because the bristles are so stiff.  They remain in almost new condition for a couple of months.  They do a wonderful job cleaning and brushing is a pleasure instead of a chore.  (I have tooth sensitivity and I love the stiff bristles--soft bristles bother my teeth.)  Today I accidentally picked up the Crossaction Pro-Health and I was certainly disappointed.  I noticed the last set of bristles was green instead of white and the head size said large instead of full, but I thought Oral-B had just done a product makeover.  To my disappointment, the Crossaction Pro-Health cannot compare to the original Crossaction.  I just bought the Pro-Health today and the bristles are softer than those of my 3 month old used original Crossaction brush.  If Pro-Health was in big letters and they didn\'t look so similar I wouldn\'t complain, but the toothbrushes look exactly alike and Pro-Health is *tiny* on the packaging, so small that I didn\'t even notice it until I got the packaging out of the trash to include the UPC in my letter to Oral-B regarding the suspected makeover.  And that is how long it took me to realize that Oral-B hadn\'t done a makeover, I just bought the wrong brush.  Ugh...  Do yourself a big favor and buy the Oral-B Crossaction Toothbrush instead of the Oral-B Crossaction Pro-Health Toothbrush.

Finding a great toothbrush can be a chore with the seemingly infinite options. When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions. Let me say I will be sticking with this one. The bristles are firm and \'aggressive\', albeit a gentle aggressive if that makes sense, while soft making it less likely to brush away enamel and/or gums. This was key for me. Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line. The back of the head of the brush serves as a tongue cleaner. It is really a scraper, so it\'s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn\'t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it. I highly recommend this brush!"

But lately, I\'ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \'bristles\' and how they\'d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I\'d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I\'ll be certain to purchase this model again.

Put simply, his orthodontist bills will be horrendous. And while he still hates to brush his teeth, I can feel confident that the dental bills won\'t outstrip the orthodontist. The two-minute timer is especially helpful for everyone, as Son knows when he\'s done and I can listen for the toothbrush to signal rather than digging up yet another destroyed kitchen timer. The action on the toothbrush head is much better than what he can do himself, though I have no idea whether it actually removes any staining (he\'s a little young for coffee and red wine issues).The price is very reasonable (particularly considering the cost of some other rechargeable toothbrushes) and the cost for the head replacements is not bad either.

The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.In particular, note that the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per second, and does not have a battery charging indicator. All of which are present just one level up in the Professional Care 1000.To me the lack of a quadrant timer is a big disappointment - I don\'t want to be watching a clock while brushing if I don\'t  have to. The gentle thrumming of the Professional Care 1000 every 30 seconds is a very nice pacer.The brushes in the Professional Care series not only add quadrant timers, but also are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second, and have battery charge indicators.As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.Overall, I found the Vitality to be lacking features that I rely on. Hence my rating. I\'d strongly recommend that you consider the Professional Care 1000 as the minimum entry level functionality for a brush.

I really can tell the difference in my teeth\'s cleanliness and shine after only three days. I especially notice the difference on the biting surfaces, which seem smoother somehow. I also notice that when I floss after using this product, there is less \'stuff\' pulled out by the floss. I take that discovery to mean that this brush really does get in between teeth to remove food that normal brushes miss.A couple of other interesting features.1 - after 2 minutes, the brush noticeably pulses to alert you that you have passed the first brushing milestone - the minimum recommended brushing time. After 2 additional minutes, it pulses you again to let you know you should stop, having reached the recommended maximum brushing time. My wife, an exceptionally conscientious brusher, was amazed at how long 2 minutes really is. She had been under brushing for a long time.2 - The recharger acts as a stand for the unit, but you do not need to keep it plugged in to an outlet. A full charge lasts at least a week or more.3 - The unit seems well engineered, is easy to hold and the brush heads that come with the unit seem to fit \'just right\' in the mouth.4 - The first time I used it, the vibration was a bit surprising. It took my 2 or 3 uses until the novelty wore off, though brushing my tongue results is still a work in process. By the way, for those worried about sensitivity to vibration, I have mildly sensitive teeth, and the vibration has caused absolutely NO discomfort to any of my teeth.5 - Some people mention in their reviews that the brush was harsh on the gums the first time that they used it. I agree that the brush is a bit stiff the first time you use it, but after 1-2 uses, they seemed to soften a bit and now the brush seems to be very gentle on my gums.My only problem with this unit is that my wife and I are going to fight over it when I travel on business...Actually, there are a couple of short comings, but these should be easy to address. First, both of the brushing heads (which are detachable) are identical. A color band or some other distinguishing mark would be helpful to people sharing the device. Also, there is no battery indicator. I found out this morning that the battery was dying, when in the period of 30 seconds, the brush went from what seemed like full power to no power at all. Recharging it for 5 minutes allowed me to finish, but that\'s not an acceptable design choice. Perhaps a small red LED or an audible chime alerting users to a low battery will make it in to future designs."

I brush and floss at least once a day, maybe two if I have time.  Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.Then this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information - you find out that the brush tells you how to time your brushing.  It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  Yes, and further, the brush signals you to change.Quick reminder, after you put the toothpaste on your brush, press it to your teeth before turning it on, otherwise you get to spend some time cleaning toothpaste off the bathroom mirror, walls, and perhaps ceiling.  One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over the entire area - front, bottom, back, and gumline.  After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.  I was impressed.After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  I rinsed, and looked in the mirror.  To my surprise, I could already see a change in my teeth.  It was slight, but noticeable to me.  After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost."

I\'ve been meaning to get one and finally got around to it.  My dentist really sings the praises of these types of toothbrushes.After using this Oral-b 3K for a few weeks I really like it so far.  The first few times using it were a bit jarring because it sort of feels like a jackhammer on my teeth.  But, my teeth feel much cleaner than regular brushing and it\'s easier to clean a few plaque-prone areas.My pros:  seems superior method to regular toothbrush, good handle size in my hand, good brush size in my mouth, holds a good battery charge, base has spots for extra heads for other family members, pressure sensor light works for me, timer is good.My cons:  my only con so far is that I don\'t like how the base charger cord is long...this sits on my bathroom vanity so has unsightly cord bunched...would like shorter cord or hide it in the base somehow.I can\'t speak to durability so far since only been using a few weeks...if anything notable happens I will update this post.

That may be true in some instances, but what I didn\'t realize until I tried this toothbrush was that most people probably love their electric toothbrushes because they work so much better than a traditional toothbrush.  I\'m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that \'just came from the dentist\' clean feeling.I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in \'timer\' that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  I don\'t think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you\'re done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush, I purchased five heads for the price of 3 of the brand-name ones.The only feature I don\'t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you\'re using too much pressure when you brush.  I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on, I can\'t imagine most people normally brush that hard.  So for me this was not a necessary option, it\'s just there though and doesn\'t interfere with the use of the brush in any way.I only wish I had discovered the ease and pleasure of having such clean teeth earlier - I definitely recommend this brush!"

Oral B is lower  in price and seems to do the same job Great thing about Oral B is it\'s very lightweight, easily packed for travel and offers a large variety of replacement brushes. The brush itself was harder than I\'d like but they do offer softer ones for those with sensitive teeth. They also offer a brush for those with braces, implants, crowns and bridges. It\'s a bit pricey and I bought it. Once I check it out, I\'ll write a review on that separately. Overall, a reasonably priced product, lightweight. The battery is built in, so you will need to recharge accordingly, most likely once or twice a month. My only gripe is that there is no cover for the brush."

It reuses the old heads (so it lets us leverage our existing investment in heads), but is WAY better.  It seems to spin faster and more powerfully; basically, we\'re sure that it cleans better.  There\'s a visible difference.There are some neat features as well.  It beeps to let you know when you can finish brushing a quadrant of your mouth (like the Sonicare), and a bright red light goes off when you push too hard.  Brushing too hard can wear away the gums, damage that can be very difficult & expensive to repair... if it is repairable.  (Unfortunately, we have a lot of personal experience with overagressive brushing.)We\'ve also tried the Sonicare in the past, and found the Oral-B to be superior.  The Sonicare didn\'t really do a good job of cleaning our teeth.  There are some parts, esp behind the front teeth, that Sonicare doesn\'t really do a good job of reaching.  The round head of the Oral-b allows us to reach everywhere.  After switching from the Sonicare to the Vitality, my periodontist told me she saw an improvement.

Too Pricey for What it Does, Though","I have SLE and sjogren\'s (another autoimmune disease that has pretty much destroyed my salivary glands).  I do not have enough spit in my mouth, which leaves my gums fragile and my teeth prone to cavities - even in the front.  My dentist is great and is working with me to save my teeth and gums, but I have to stay on top of things.I have been using a sonicare for a couple of years.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The sonic waves sort of pummel out the junk between my teeth and loosen it up even places that the toothbrush cannot physically go.  However, that brush brutalizes my gums and the sonic action sprays stuff everywhere - my sink and mirror look like a crime scene after I brush.  The Oral-b 3000 cleans physically only - no sonic stuff, so it only gets the stuff the bristles can get to.  That amounts to teeth that are slightly less clean in spots than what I get from the other brush.  However, my gums barely bleed at all when I use this on the sensitive setting.If your main concern is gum disease, and you\'re a good flosser, I would recommend this over the sonicare, because you\'ll be able to massage your gumline without damaging good tissue.  Press the start button twice for the sensitive setting, and you\'re good to go.I deducted one star for the price point.  I think a brush this expensive ought to include sonic technology.  Sonicare has the essence for $40 less than today\'s price for the oral-b 3000,  but if you need a decent brush that will not hurt your gums, this is probably worth the added expense.  I give it an 8.5.  It cleans better than the lower-priced oral-b products - almost as well as the sonicare.  The sensitive setting is a really nice feature for people like me with fragile gums. And replacement heads are affordable - much less expensive than the sonicare."

I have read some other reviews comparing this to the next model up and one of the  major differences is that the charging station and the tooth brush have the indicator light but as long as you brush in front of the mirror you can see the light on the toothbrush and if you aren\'t brushing in front of the mirror you wouldnt see the light on the base either unless you don\'t have a mirror over you sink or don\'t have your toothbrush at your sink, neither of which makes much sense!

After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up. Unfortunately i cannot tell you if they will last a long time since i just got mine about a week ago but i can tell you the difference between the two brands.The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you\'re not trying to, just when you\'re normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you\'re doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B\'s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i\'m brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B\'s. It\'s a bit annoying.The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy ine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They\'re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, but i\'ve yet to see how often they break. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They\'re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you\'re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain."

I couldn\'t believe the deal I got on here!  I saved about half compared to other stores in my area.  If you have sensitive teeth I would highly recommend this model.  Oral-B also makes the 1000 series model.  There\'s nothing wrong with this I am sure, however I believe it doesn\'t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  The only downfall is that about once a week you do have to charge the battery (which does take about 17 hours).  Honestly, that\'s not a big deal.  The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  It has room for additional brush heads.  It\'s a nice feature, but something I really don\'t find the need for.

While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  My last toothbrush had a tiny LED screen built into the brush that displayed battery life.  However, after about a year, this screen shorted out and became useless. The unit eventually just gave out and I had to replace it.I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard. I wish I actually had this feature years ago because I was brushing too hard and scrubbed away much of my enamel.It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  There are better brushes for you gums.  However, if I could give half stars, I would give this unit a 4.5/5 star rating.Oral-B was also running a promo at the time; if you buy an qualifying unit, you can receive an 50% mail in rebate.  So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  So for $40, this is a great brush.  This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard no matter which unit/brand you buy. I also like that it takes up a small amount of space on my countertop; I wish the power cord was detachable for easier storage though - not a big deal however.All in all, it is a good brush.

(30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right) This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.  Like lying on the couch with the dog and the boyfriend.  Comfortable, perfect.I swear my teeth are cleaner looking.  I don\'t swing with that whitening paste, it ruins your enamel. I think this brush makes the difference. My gums feel awesome and healthy.Seriously, what have I been doing all my life??"

Which I am attributing to the floss action head that we are using with this.I do wish this had a charging light, with seeing that gives me comfort that it is meeting the contacts on the base and I can rest assured knowing it is charging, without it, I can only \'hope\' it\'s working.I also love that we have a variety of heads to choose from, being as my husband does not like the same tooth brushes as me."

My hygieneist recommended the Oral B a while back and I took her advice.why I like my Oral B better:1- The heads are small and round like the dentist\'s equipment. It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than \'brushing\' like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).2- It\'s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.3- If it pops out of your mouth while it\'s running, it doesn\'t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.4- It doesn\'t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever? I was told my gums are in much better shape than before.6- It\'s cheaper.  \'nough said."

I always felt that my toothbrush couldn\'t ever reach that far and this is what I get. TWO disgusting cavities. I had it filled, but the week before I had it done I immediately searched on amazon for this electronic toothbrush. Now, I can\'t live without it. I feel it\'s cleaning my teeth down to a micro-level AND it\'s so easy to brush for 2 minutes because the electronic toothbrush notifies you when time is up. I definitely wouldn\'t count 120 seconds (I\'ve never ever ever in my life brushed for that long). THANK YOU ORAL-B!! Thank you AMAZON!

2840,2915,20100916,B003UKM90Q,4,"September 16, 2010",AEVSRK7S3K8QU,Perfect Price Point for an Electric Toothbrush,"I\'ve been looking at the more expensive electric toothbrushes -- Sonicare, and higher end Oral-b -- for quite some time, but could never pull the trigger when for the same price, I can practically buy a lifetime supply of manual toothbrushes.  I\'d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it\'s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you\'re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.I have one implant, and some \'erosions\' on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it\'s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.Don\'t throw away that manual toothbrush, though.  There is still one mouth maintenance chore that the Oral-b does not handle well -- brushing of your tongue.  The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \'tooth\' brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  If you check my other reviews, you\'ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed."

Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  The icing on the cake is the low price of this brush. Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  This is an excellent product. 4.5 Stars*** Positive Points: ***- Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)- Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3). The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).- It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base. You simply stick the raised portion of the charger into the end of the brush.- Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries- Brush vibrates to let you know when you have gone over the recommended 2 minute brush time.- 2 year warranty*** Negative Points: ***- Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.- There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.- The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouthOverall:  This toothbrush cannot be beat for its price.

This brush is far better than my previous one, to the point that I have to order a second one since my wife already stole mine for herself!Here are the details, mostly in comparison to the Crest SpinBrush I was using before.The good:* Rechargeable - big plus for me. I\'ve gone through a lot of batteries on the Crest brush.* Variety of replaceable heads - currently using the Vitality Floss Action but like the availability of other styles* 2-minute timer - automatically tells you after 2 minutes of brushing, great way to build that habit* Good speed, not too fast or slow, just feels right* Mouth feels cleaner after this brush than with my previous spinbrushThe Not-so-good:* No indicator for battery life - It is designed with the expectation that most people will leave it plugged in all the time, but I prefer to run my batteries down between charges and I didn\'t get much warning when it quit in the middle of a brush one night.Other than that, I love this brush.

I\'m lucky to have a great dentist who is working to help me save my teeth and gums, but it requires a lot of vigilance on my part.On a friend\'s recommendation, I started using a sonicare elite.  That brush does a great job, but brush heads are expensive and a little on the hard side.  Every time I brush my teeth with that one, the sink looks like a crime scene by the time I am finished.  The Oral-b vitality did not rough up my gums nearly as much, and it costs about the same as a replacement brush pack for the sonicare.On the other hand, the brush head feels a bit more bulky in my mouth and my teeth don\'t feel quite as clean as they usually do, but I don\'t dread using it nearly as much as I do the sonicare.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this brush an 8, based on price (great), comfort level (nice and soft but bulky), convenience (the 2 minute timer is important), and cleaning (not quite as good as my other power toothbrush)."

Still going on its original rechargable battery pack without problems.  Also since using it, and  using it almost exclusively during same 3-4 years, have had at least 50% less plaque/tartar deposits for my dentist\'s office to clean at my regular semi-annual check-ups--a fact much appreciated by same professionals and one that more than one dental hygienist has noted on countless patients who regularly use such brushes.  Oh, btw, when it comes time to replace the brush on these little jewels try to buy same replacement from your dentist office.  My dentist charges essentially at-cost, approximately $6 USD, for replacement brushes for my model while our local dept. stores charge anywhere from about $17-23 USD."

I examined every part of the toothbrush to see where it could have come from, and eventually rinsed out this tiny little hole towards the top of the toothbrush (which I had never noticed or thought about before) and found, to my horror, that it was absolutely filled with disgusting mold. You know those scenes in lowbrow comedies where a character finds out that they\'ve eaten something disgusting, and desperately try to clean out their mouth until they feel better? Yeah, the scene that followed was kind of like that.Maybe I missed something in the instructional booklet (and I DID read it,) but I had no idea I should be on the look-out for mold in such a random place in my toothbrush. A Google search has shown me that a lot of people have the same problem, and they fix it using things like bleach, hotel towels (\'Because it\'s too revolting to even use my own towels on it\') and an independently-created product that attempts to seal the stupid little hole.Personally, I\'m not going to use a hygiene product that can cause way more harm than good. I\'m going to give Oral-B the benefit of the doubt by being open to the idea that MAYBE this problem is avoidable with most electric toothbrush designs, but I still think it\'s really irresponsible to not at least include a note in the packaging that explains proper cleaning procedures."

I went to ConsumerReports, and the ones they really liked were pretty expensive, so Istalled, and then forgot about it.  This time my hygienist broke downand recommended the Vitality, which I found for less than $30.  I wasvery glad to see that this generation of electric brushes doesn\'trequire a big box, just a small recharger.The instructions were a bit confusing, and there was no clearindication of there being a timer or how to use it.  The word \'timer\'is printed near the on/off switch, however.  The first time I used thebrush I was about 75% done when the brush pulsed for a second. Ithink that\'s the \'timer\'.  That has continued to happen every time Ibrush with it.  I\'m pleased to know that apparently I\'ve been brushingmy teeth for well over two minutes all along.Update 5/7/12:  After more than six months I can say that my teeth andgums are definitely healthier.

Before this, I\'ve used a variety of regular toothbrushes and spent a lot of money on the latest toothpastes but my teeth didn\'t feel completely clean unless I went for a cleaning at the dentist. With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh. The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline. It\'s not a substitute for flossing, but an additional help. My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven\'t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power. If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better. I\'m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea).

I feel like my teeth are a lot cleaner (although I\'m not a dentist so I can\'t be sure.)This was easy to figure out and easy to use. It\'s comfortable once you get used to it.The only downside is more for people who aren\'t used to electric toothbrushes- my gums were actually a bit sore for about a week after trying this at first.

While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I\'m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn\'t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don\'t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I\'d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I\'ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I\'m not a dental health professional, so I don\'t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn\'t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it\'s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can\'t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I\'m afraid I don\'t care for it enough to do even that).If you\'re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I\'ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn\'t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums."

It took some getting used to but after I did I felt it was doing a good job. I recently tried the Oral-b Dual Clean and found it to be a very old school design.  The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  If I only had the choice between this and a manual toothbrush I would choose the manual brush.  I\'m sure it does an okay job and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  I also suggest considering sonic brushes that do not have rotating parts, I think after you get used to them they leave your mouth feeling cleaner."

I have been using an ultrasonic toothbrush for some time now with great results so far. What i really liked about this one is that you feel the head much more on your teeth and you feel the movement, so you end up with a feeling of having really clean mouth which I like much more than the ultrasonic.Another advantage for this one is that there are different types of heads for different uses, and they are considerably less expensive than the replacement heads for ultrasonic toothbrushes (which are almost as expensive as this brush is). I have been using my power brush for about two months, alternating with the ultrasonic, and it has worked perfectly.Overall, a pretty good power brush. For the price, this is an unbeatable value."

BUT, and it is a big \'but\' the head was too big for even an adult mouth.  I am a grown person and asked my daughter to try it.  She could barely get it in her mouth and could not maneuver it to reach her teeth with gagging.  They need to try and overcome the space needed to make the mechanicals of a swirling AND a scrubbing head able to occupy the space at the end of the brush that is supposed to fit in your mouth.  It is nice that they have designed different heads to address different issues related to plaque and gums, but if you can only reach the front region of your teeth with it, your dental health would seem to suffer.

I\'ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  My gums also feel massaged by the vibratory scrubbing they receive, hence that just-went-to-the-dentist feeling without the paperwork, wait, or cost."

The cost is there though for the initial toothbrush system and I\'m sure replacement heads are equally as expensive so it may not be worth it if you brush often.You do leave with a somewhat polished feeling so it\'s worth a try at least if you\'ve never used a power brusher.

That\'s the way I felt after using this toothbrush.I\'ve tried plenty of motorized toothbrushes in the past, from expensive to the cheapies you can grab for six bucks at a supermarket, but I\'ve always returned to a standard manual brush. Not this time, though.The Vitality is really incredible. The included two-brush heads (and you get two of them) have an oscillating section at the top, and a section that goes back and forth beneath it. While one polishes and cleans one tooth, the other is getting between them, almost making floss redundant (I said almost). It even has a timer that goes off after two minutes, pulsating the motor a couple of times to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing.After charging it up for 16 hours (which they say will give you a week of twice-a-day brushing sessions), I followed the manufacturer\'s suggestions for how to use it (yes, I actually read them - all part of the review), and can honestly say no other home toothbrush has ever made my teeth feel so clean.Additional brush heads are available in various styles, though why I\'d ever want anything beyond the two brush style that came with it eludes me (they do make a polishing head though, which I suppose I can understand even if I\'m not personally interested). According to the instructions, each head should last about three months, and with refils costing about four bucks per head (in a package of six), that nets out to about 12 dollars a year for refils: a steal for how well this works.I\'m already buying another for my kids\' bathroom: because it comes with two heads they can each have one (downside: no color coding, so I\'ll use a sharpie to delineate them).A fantastic toothbrush that is at last worth ditching a standard manual brush for, I can recommend this without reservation."

But by keeping the brush on its stand with the charging cord plugged in I should have maximum power for each brushing.  The instructions that come with the brush say you can leave it plugged in, but recommend that every 6 months you let the battery deplete itself.Like another reviewer, I have sensitive teeth and prefer a soft brush.  The brush head that came with the brush seemed to work just fine for me.  The test will be when I have my next visit to the dentist and learn whether there has been an increase in gum erosion since the last visit.  However, just based on short time use, I have no reason to think there will be a problem.  My brushing includes running the brush over my tongue and the bristles feel no different than my other brushThe brush heads that I used on the previous brush don\'t work on this, but the literature that comes with the brush describes 5 different heads that do.  Quite an interesting variety, including floss action, precision clean, white+clean, and sensitive clean.As is true of most electric toothbrushes, heads are pricey if purchased from a local stored.  Amazon sells them at a heavily discounted price, so it is a good place to buy head replacements.  What I do and recommend that others do is to buy a supply of brushes at a time in order to get the best price and insure you have enough on hand to replace a head every 3 months if used twice a day.  The per head price is cheaper if you buy a pack of 6 heads than if you buy the standard 3 pack.  Amazon has both."

What I found is that the Vitality has a lot more power -- judged by the vibrations in my head -- plus it\'s even lighter weight, has replaceable heads, and a timer.Lighter weight is good, as are the replaceable heads because that means the whole family can use one base, and you can replace the toothbrush-head after flu or colds.More power should mean that it cleans better.  What I found is that my mouth felt \'cleaner\'... BUT, after I let my teeth \'go\' and get rather \'grotty\' for test reasons, the Vitality didn\'t seem to clean any better in those hard to reach between teeth spots, than it\'s cheaper cousin.  To be honest, I\'m not sure what to make of this observation.  I tried the cheaper cousin after that, plus a standard toothbrush, and nothing worked except floss -- thank heaven -- so perhaps my expectations are too high and no brush would accomplish this task.THE SKINNY:::We will be switching to this Oral B toothbrush and the reason is that I think it\'s more cost effective for us than cheaper Oral B battery operated models that we are currently using.  Though more expensive initially, you can purchase replacement heads so the whole family can use one base.I like the timer.  I thought only the kids would benefit, but to my surprise I wasn\'t brushing long enough either.It doesn\'t remove plague like claimed, but it definitely has more power than our comparison Oral B\'s, and made my mouth feel cleaner.I liked that the brushes were NOT rock hard.  Rock-hard is not good for the gums.Pam T~mom and blogger"

There is a noticeable difference in the tongue-test on one\'s teeth after using it.The feature I thought most fascinating was the two-minute timer. A certain young man in our family will be receiving one of these brushes for Christmas. The timer just may make this a fun enough experience that he\'ll brush more regularly. (He\'s beyond the age where I can set rules. I am now in the motivate and bribe stage. (-:)Being a frugal type, I appreciated the $3. discount coupon for refills that is included in the box."

3045,3131,20110921,B00404PFDY,5,"September 21, 2011",A3RIPKCNAU8Q9I,great brush w/ high tech features-worth the money for the fun!,"This is a really fun, high quality toothbrush.  It has a long-lasting rechargeable battery, which charges whenever not in use, and does a great job on teeth with a head that is shaped for hard-to-reach areas.  But the best part of this brush is the little timer that has some kind of remote signal.  It is a clock when not in use (and gives the correct time) then becomes a timer when you start to brush.  I can walk out of the room, even, and it continues to time me.  Dentists recommend brushing at least two minutes - and you get a little smiley face when you hit two minutes, or a big smiley face (sometimes a wink) if you brush for 2:30.  My kids want one ot these now, too, but I\'d say it\'s a bit too powerful for kids.  It\'s a great buy and, while it costs way more than a standard toothbrush, it holds up beautifully and works hard.  It also comes with a carrying case for travel, which I love because power toothbrushes never fit into standard cases.  The battery charge lasts two days off the charger, so you can go away for the weekend without carrying all the gear. Love it."
3048,3134,20120501,B0043VYSI2,3,"May 1, 2012",A2PTVWCCR00WMC,Fantastic toothbrush but with outdated battery technology,"As fantastic as this toothbrush is, it is incomprehensible to me why Braun provides a 1980s-type NiCd rechargeable battery in this toothbrush that comes with infamous memory disaster (always wait until battery is fully depleted before you recharge).  And then, it takes 9 hours to fully charge the battery.  In this price category the toothbrush should come with a Lithium-based rechargeable battery that provide constant power (i.e., speed), and not like this NiCd battery that becomes slower and slower.  5 stars for the toothbrush itself, but no star for the outdated battery technology, makes it 3 stars in my book maximum."

I wish I had bought something like this years ago.  You will not regret buying this.  It was very easy to use; just plug it in, push the head on and brush away."
3051,3137,20120312,B0043VYSI2,5,"March 12, 2012",A2GT5RSOK9PVMU,fast shippment,I was happy to get my item so quickly and everything was brand new.  I was dissappointed that it did not come in a oral b box because I wanted to use a rebate I had that needed the upc code from the box.  I have been happy I spent the extra money on this toothbrush because it has so many bells and whistles.  It stops me from over brushing with the timer and actually tells me when to switch sides.
3052,3138,20120212,B0043VYSI2,5,"February 12, 2012",A10KZHHT34FX1I,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!,"This toothbrush is by far way better than any sonicare that I have used before! The timers is a plus which guides you and even tells you if your pressing too hard. I first bought this a while back ago but didn\'t want to write a review until I fully tested it out for a several months. I bought mine from Oral Care Deals so this review is from their product, and I was very pleased by them. One thing that I absolutely LOVED about this toothbrush was its ability to change the brush tip, which also comes with colored rings that you can identify which person it belongs too. I initially was looking for an electric toothbrush for me and my husband but when i came across this one i found out that we can both use it and all we have to do is to change the brush tip. It comes with a brush tip holder that you can place 4 tips one, so basically 4 people can use this one brush, now thats awesome by itself! We found that the battery is long lasting so you don\'t need to charge it after a few brushes. the grip is comfortable and its easy on the wrist! every time I brush I get the same feeling as i do when i go to my dentist for my six month cleaning. My dentist even said this is the best one on the market right now. Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well. bottom line don\'t hesitate to buy this model (dental professional exclusive 5000 series) because it an investment that will pay off."
3060,3146,20110926,B0043VYSI2,5,"September 26, 2011",A1CNOA86E5WX4P,I don\'t know how I lived without it.,"I am one of those people that hates going to the dentist!  While I have been blessed with a cavity free mouth, I still hate enduring the scrape of the dentist\'s tools against my teeth. And I know it\'s just a matter of time until the dentist breaks out his drill...It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  You can probably chalk it up to \'user error\'....  I wasn\'t brushing properly, nor long enough to really keep a clean mouth.I did a bunch of research on electric toothbrushes to see what the fuss was about. Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  hmmm...  more research led me to this model - the motorized head rotates in the recommended pattern and the handle buzzes/vibrates in 30 or 45 second intervals to help you judge the brushing time of each section of your mouth.  Recommended time is 30 seconds per quadrant.  But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn\'t enough for me.  What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up) the amount of time you have been brushing.  If you look at the picture of the box, you can see the digital display, it\'s a little bit bigger than a business card, and about an inch thick.  As you are brushing, the display will track the quadrant you are brushing, and when your brush handle buzzes, the digital display will move to the next quadrant - giving you a visual que to move on to the next section of your mouth. It will even tell you if you\'re brushing too hard! When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds... the smiley face will wink at you!  :  It\'s a flirty toothbrush!My husband and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  We absolutely love them.  We recieved them two days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.  I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn\'t a big deal. I never have to wonder if I\'m brushing properly or if I\'m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \'fresh from the dentist\' clean mouth.  The handle holds its\' charge for a long time, I can brush for 2 1/2 minutes twice a day, for 9 days before having to recharge - however, I usually keep the brush handle in the charger when it\'s not in use.I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  The travel case is a hard, sturdy plastic to protect the brush handle, and the detachable brush.  It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly. My toothbrush will never again travel in a ziploc baggie.  :) Yay!I did have a little bit of sticker shock when I purchased two of these at the same time, and then again when I saw the cost of replacement brush heads.  But I feel like I am taking good care of my teeth, and I know my next dentist appointment will be less stressful.  Also - I know P&G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time. This makes me feel like I\'ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  Plus P&G offers coupons on their website all the time, so I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.This model isn\'t just an electric toothbrush - It\'s quality control for your mouth!  I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  Happy Brushing."
