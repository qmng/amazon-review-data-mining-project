18,18,20100418,B00006ANDJ,1,"April 18, 2010",A17Y0UZ9ZVPPPD,Surprisingly poor quality for an OralB product,"I purchased a multi-pack of electric toothbrush heads from USHealth Tests and Products (via Amazon) several months ago. Unfortunately the competitive price of this product did not make up for the poor quality and unsafety of it. During brushing, small pieces of metal came out of the toothbrush heads and shot into the gums and lips, sometimes causing lacerations. After this, the round brushing part of the head would come loose itself.After 3 of the toothbrush heads did this, I contacted the seller by email and then by phone and explained the problem to them. They apologized and explained that this was a generic product from a chinese manufacturer and although they had never run into this/any problem with their products before, they would send me a replacement (oral B original) product. I agreed.Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, as I began to use these \'original oral B\' toothbrush heads, the same problem has recurred with pieces of metal shooting out of the rotating toothbrush head during brushing and hitting the gums and lips. I\'ve been using oral B electric toothbrushes for a few years and have never seen anything like this. I\'m not exactly sure if this second set I have received are really oral B products or not.My point is that low price apparently means poor quality, at least in the case of this seller."

I found the best value on Amazon by BelowCostJML. They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&H for my whole shipment. (I ordered 5x the item of 6 brushes/ea, so 3 bucks S&H for 30 brush heads).Other sellers came somewhat close in pricing but wanted $7-10 S&H fees, not to mention that some would limit you to 1 item (of 3 brushes)/order. So if I wanted to increase the quantity to get the 30 brush heads I got from BelowCostJML, I would have to literally place the order 10 times and pay the ludicrous S&H cost 10x!I\'m thankful for BelowCostJML\'s fair pricing, including S&H and for their great service! The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time. Very pleased with the service!The product speaks for itself, I\'ve been a satisfied user for 8 years and I personally find it gentler in the mouth than Sonicare [I\'ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque (it\'s just a matter of each individual\'s preference)... I guess the \'difference\' would be equivalent to Pepsi versus Coke if you will (not that I\'m encouraging regular consumption of either): they give you the same overall effect, it just depends which one you prefer best. Hope this helped. Happy brushing (and don\'t forget to floss, too). :-)"

149,152,20100705,B00006ANDK,2,"July 5, 2010",A3EKC0CWQQRXPJ,Unsanitary!!!,"I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care electric toothbrush set with these Oral-B Sensitive brush heads for over 4yrs now.  I GENERALLY am a review & research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I\'ve read reviews on but I went in for a dental appointment years ago and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding & inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers so I was sold! I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn\'t compare any former experience and simply didn\'t know any better.  I DO have to say that other than my \'unsanitary\' concern about these that I\'ll get to in a moment, it\'s great! I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard, it\'s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine, I have never had any \'break\' or get wobbly on me, there is a color indicator where the blue area on your toothbrush gets lighter over time to let you know when it\'s time to swap out your toothbrush, etc.Let me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it\'s clean & smells good, my home is clean - in fact I\'m actually somewhat of a germaphobe so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  I know it\'s odd to point all that out but I didn\'t want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  :-).No matter WHAT I do...I\'ve tried using bottled water to brush my teeth thinking it\'s our tap water (it\'s not...my kids & hubby don\'t have an issue w/ their toothbrushes); I\'ve tried switching to a different toothsoap / tooth powder / toothpaste - and I STILL have the same issue.  My hubby & dentist have confirmed that I don\'t have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth so it\'s not in my mouth...so I\'m left to think that is DEFINITELY the DESIGN of Oral-B toothbrush replacements heads!!!Humor me for a minute and do a \'zoom\' on the picture of Oral-B replacement toothbrushes in the middle of the toothbrush handle.  There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle while brushing then certainly a mixture of that & water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets in.I DO make a habit of actually removing my brush head in running water and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks & on the bottom where you place the charger) AND on the toothbrush head itself - both on the brush area and on & inside the handle and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide & a clean washcloth (since I didn\'t know where the smell was coming from) AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  It does NOT happen when I take all of these precautions but in my opinion, I shouldn\'t HAVE to do this in order to avoid the musty smell...musty stench means that bacteria is harboring & growing so to stick something filled with germs to \'clean\' with is not the best option in my opinion.FYI: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it\'s not me and sure enough, it\'s not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn\'t have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I\'m currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it\'s a design flaw in the brush design.I\'d rather not have to worry if my toothbrush is growing bacteria or not, I want to simply rinse the brush & handle after each use and store it away like I\'m supposed to be able to do.  I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  I don\'t understand how anyone else hasn\'t complained about this issue - maybe I\'m taking care of them wrong but I\'ve even called the company and it was suggested that maybe it was our water or toothpaste...when I told her that my other family members didn\'t have this issue, she was at a loss.For those who are also looking & comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it\'s more dome shaped so the toothpaste \'gunk\' from brushing & rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the \'dome shape\' vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle & electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B\'s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it\'s hard to get in small areas of your mouth."
151,154,20100609,B00006ANDK,4,"June 9, 2010",A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX,"Gentle, but wish it was recyclable, like Preserve","I am a huge fan of powered toothbrushes - my mouth just doesn\'t feel as clean when I use a manual toothbrush. I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that\'s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference! I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads. They feel softer on my gums and so I think they are a gentler choice. I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth. I have been using these heads for almost 10 years and often get compliments at the dentist. Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums. Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best. I\'m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn\'t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth & gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.I do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect. I\'ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months. I find that the blue begins to fade after one month. I think I\'m an average brusher (twice or more daily) and I even have two toothbrushes I switch between (depending on which is charged & what bathroom I\'m in), so I would think that the indicator would last longer.This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE! Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (& recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual. (If you\'re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve. They sell plates, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, razors, etc. & I do really like their razors) I know that plastic recycling isn\'t the best thing for the environment, but it\'s gotta be better than throwing all these heads in the trash/dump/ocean... I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they\'re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.) But, I can only keep so many. Anyway, that\'s why I give this product 4 stars, instead of 5. Gentle, but wish they were recycled & recyclable.Many thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)"

I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head).

They are totally inferior to the real thing available at 3 for $21.00 in American drug stores.  The brushing heads quickly become loose and the body slips on the metal shaft of the toothbrush base.

Amazon claims that \'The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\'  But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush. The toothbrush does work, however. I have two identical Oral-B 3D excel toothbrushes purchased on 8/20/01.  To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  I run the battery down to zero on the one I\'m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it\'s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle itself.Some reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that\'s hard to imagine:  there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  It\'s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it. It\'s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better."

They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That\'s a real laugh.

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It\'s kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for four Flexisoft EB17 heads for $24.99 (The EB17-4 just means there are four of them).  There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $12.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!"

Also, I closely compared an off brand one to an Oral-B and found that there are less bristles on the cheaper one. The bristles are in little groups: Oral B=26, offbrand=18.

The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference is in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. I personally wouldn\'t buy from Amazon because it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off may be similar in quality.I bought several different brush heads from Amazon this Christmas, and all appear to be fakes.

I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  I brush twice a day, on and off with Seonsodyne Whitenting and Sensodyne Pronamel. I also ensured that I used the \'Whitening\' brush setting that the toothbrush offers. Between the two photos, I noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not very much.  My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  So I\'d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  It would probably be nice to have it your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don\'t expect too much.  It might be somewhat of a gimmick that it \'whitens\' teeth, but if you look at what the item is called--Pro White, it is designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth and make them a little whiter.  SO in all fairness, I\'d say that it works as it should without huge results that people may expect of it."

With an \'old fashioned\' toothbrush, I always looked for the most bristles I could find so I was surprised to discover I actually prefer the smaller Oral B toothbrush head to this one!!  The simple reason is that with the smaller head (with just the cicle of bristles), I feel like I have more control and can really get around my back teeth.  This will really boil down to preference for anyone.  I\'m sure both are great at getting your teeth clean.  But for me, I am going to stick with the standard head that comes with the toothbrush."

At first, this veteran user of the EB17 Flexisoft head was a bit skeptical. But after a few days use, I have a new favorite.The dual-brush head is a bit bigger than the traditional round head. The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars. But this head is great for quickie between meal cleaning, and as a bonus is pretty good at brushing off my tongue.This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure. Since EB17s usually run about $5 per head in 3-, 4-, and 6-packs, finding the EB417 about the same price is a relief. You really DO want to replace heads every few months, after the outer blue bristles fade half-way down."

However, after having received it, I\'m a little dissappointed.  It doesn\'t appear as though it\'s that big, but it feels very large in mouth.  It felt like I was trying to brush my teeth with my thumb.  I had trouble getting the brush into the far reaches of my mouth whereas before with the smaller head I had no problems.  I\'m not a small person either, I\'m 6\'1\' and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  It\'s really not that different than the standard head, it\'s just bigger.  I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  Because of this, getting the brush into every nook and cranny is now more difficult.  Also, because it is bigger, it\'s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.  I should have bought the single one just to try it out, but I was certain I\'d love the bigger one.  Oh well..."

This will ensure that they always slide on and off the handle easily.

Bristles packed tightly and of the correct color, serial number intact, 2 color rings included with each brush and packaging checked out with what the genuine manufacturer produces.I know amazon can have multiple vendors for one listing and the subheading should disclose the info at time of order.

Upon receiving the product, it did not look anything like the original brush heads that I received with the toothbrush I bought months ago from Amazon. The primary differences were: the bristles were the wrong color(the center green was a darker translucent color instead of the opaque light green), the bristles were splayed out instead of in tight clusters, and the gray logo was much lighter. I chalked this up to maybe changes in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the first brush head I tried did not work at all. I chalked that up to manufacturing defect. The second one worked, but didn\'t quite feel right. I decided to just go with it however, and after a month the brush head became very loose. I saw the other reviews and photos and realized that I had received fake product directly from Amazon.Here is the worst part. I decided to purchase replacement heads from Walgreens retail store. I got home and realized that they were also fake product. So, then I went to Target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine. I was floored to find fake product in a retail chain store as well as at Amazon.So, TLDR buyer beware of fake product when ordering online or shopping at retail. Look at the brush heads carefully before you make your purchase. It seems like there is a major counterfeiting problem right now and it hopefully gets resolved soon."

This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives. While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.Second thing to note, this shouldn\'t be a flossing replacement. You\'d think it\'d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely unnecessary.Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.So, with that, you\'d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right? Well, maybe not. For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn\'t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush. I don\'t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn\'t feel radically different from using a medium bristle brush.These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth clean.Finally, these heads seem to fit my teeth perfect, but I should note, I have a large mouth and large teeth. As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they\'d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/mouths.All in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone."

They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft. Also, the \'floss action\' plastic tips around the perimeter don\'t really seem to be flossing more than they are just contributing to the roughness of the overall brushing experience.

The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days.  3 days is the new norm. That\'s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger.  It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference.  After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it\'s smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."

So when the new tubes came (I order several at a time) I figured it was just an update on the packaging and not a new formula, as the canker sore labeling was still there. Yet within a day of using the new stuff, the inside of my mouth was entirely covered in canker sores. I even got one on my lips, a first. It took a few days for all of them to go away, but this is obviously not the same toothpaste as before.If a company changes a formula on something like this, that should be made clear.

Recently it was time to order a new supply and I noticed that they had changed the name of the product to \'Extra Gentle\'. Seeing that they were still saying this was for canker sore sufferers I bought several tubes. Almost immediately after I started using this product I had one canker sore after another. I then changed to another SLS free brand and everything has healed up and is back to normal. My thoughts are that either this new product is worthless for preventing canker sores or I got a bad batch that had SLS in it. Attempts to contact the company through the \'contact us\' section of their web site have failed. I guess I\'ll be throwing away several tubes of this not inexpensive toothpaste.1/22 Edit - A few days after posting this review Rembrandt responded to my complaint to them about this product. We\'re in the process of returning the toothpaste for coupons for other Rembrandt products. Better that throwing them away I suppose.

I had very frequent canker sores (often 2 or more at any given point in time), possibly the result of a sensitivity to an ingredient in standard toothpaste and mouthwash.  So I switched to this toothpaste and to Crest Pro-Health mouthwash and I have not had one single canker sore in an entire year.

Glide Deep Clean is wonderfully smooth and comfortable, making flossing downright pleasant on both your gums and your fingers. The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you\'ve cleaned.But... It\'s the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest\'s claims of being \'shred resistant\' fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven\'t yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can\'t even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn\'t inspire confidence. At the price premium Crest is demanding, I\'d expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece."

The original must have lasted at least 10 years, but the replacement doesn\'t look like it will hold up as well.  It works fine with the coffee maker though.Reusable filters seem to let more fine grounds and sediment through than a good paper filter and while they don\'t use paper they do require water to wash them so I don\'t know that they\'re really all that much better for the environment than a disposable filter.  If you understand the advantages and disadvantages and know what you\'re getting, this seems a fine reusable filter.  Be advised that if you have a Braun coffee maker you might need the Braun brand replacement filter as some off-brand replacement filters don\'t have the \'notches\' in the rim of the filter that you would need to fit some Braun coffee makers.The description of the product on the Amazon page that I ordered the filter from is wrong.

Grounds in coffee - not so good.Finally, the Brita water filter that is a part of this coffee-maker (sold separately of course) works well too."

I also like that it is much less bulky and feels more natural in my hand. I went into my dentist four months (and zero uses of dental floss) after starting with the Pulsonic and she said \'finally, you\'re actually using dental floss! I\'m so proud of you\'.

After searching for fine print, we went ahead with the purchase as we were unable to locate any other details of the rebate except that it was a $20 mail in to be postmarked prior to April 1.  Once we completed the purchase and went to fill out the form, we then discovered that the rebate was only applicable to one toothbrush, despite our purchasing two on the same order. After calling the customer service number, we were told we are S.O.L. on getting the rebate for both, and there is no way to \'contact the seller\' about this.Thus we have taken to the always useful Comments section to air our grievance; We are Prime members, buy a lot of products on Amazon, and feel like Amazon should definitely do better.The toothbrushes do work great though, and despite our now degraded opinion of Amazon rebates etc, we are happy with the product so far."

Great product!I\'ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in it\'s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I\'ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don\'t know what they\'re talking about. I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down. Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.Don\'t hesitate to purchase a Pulsonic. But shop around for replacement heads. I found there\'s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive. However, this Pulsonic has two speeds, and she has found the slower speed to be perfect for her.Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he\'s happy with it too.

When I first used it, I could almost feel it break up any buildup on my teeth.  It truly felt like I just had my regular cleaning at the dentist.Besides the fact that the brush actually delivers on the results, the design is very well thought out.  The handle is slim and light and as easy to hold as a regular toothbrush.  The head vibration is well isolated from the handle and does not cause any discomfort.  The whole brush is completely water proof and can be washed easily.  There are no visible contacts for charging.  It just sits in the base and charges (I assume by induction) perfectly fine.It has a couple of settings for brushing or massaging and although I prefer the brushing setting for regular brushing, the massaging setting felt nice on my gums.  It has a reminder in the form of a brief pause every thirty seconds to facilitate proper brush timing.The brush comes with an additional smaller head that is meant to clean between the teeth.  It also does an excellent job at breaking up any particles and cleaning the space between the teeth and along the gum line.This is a very well built and thought out brush and I highly recommend it."

At first it tingled so much touching my tongue that I had to take a break from brushing, but after a few days I got used to it. I haven\'t used electric toothbrushes before, so I can only compare the Oral-B Pulsonic to manual toothbrushes. I find that the Pulsonic leaves my teeth feeling smoother than my manual toothbrush and, apart from the tingling, it doesn\'t seem to have any negative effect on my gums.Pros:* Non-contact induction charging mechanism means there\'s no metal contacts to get dirty and prevent charging* Built-in timer to remind you to spend the recommended 30s brushing each quandrant of your teeth* The smaller of the interchangeable brush heads allows you to brush hard-to-reach areas* Teeth feel very clean and smooth after brushingCons:* Non-contact charging mechanism is less efficient than a wired connection and therefore wastes energy* Rechargeable battery is not replaceable - the entire toothbrush must be replaced when the battery wears out* It doesn\'t come with a carrying case.

It otherwise has the same features as other electronic toothbrushes ie 2 minute notification, as well as 4 30 second interruptions to let you know to move around in your mouth.

I wore the tip out within a few weeks. The only replacement heads for this toothbrush have three regular brushes and only a single precision tip. I searched high and low for just replacement precision tips - nothing on line. Called Oral-B they told me to get a head that does not work with this vibrating toothbrush.

The electric cord is about 4 feet long and there are slots on the back and both sides to direct the cord in 3 different directions.

After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.-----THE GIST OF IT---------I\'m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that\'s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn\'t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It\'s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn\'t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn\'t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It\'s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.-----ENDING------Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won\'t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won\'t do it.  They\'ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.Lastly, I don\'t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes."

The two min. timer, broken up into 30 sec intervals is great for people like me who may not brush as long as they should without such a reminder."

I bought this toothbrush after my Sonicare fell on the floor and never worked the same. I have been using a Crest Spinbrush since my Sonicare broke, which I hated. I have been using the Pulsonic for a few weeks now. This toothbrush is amazing! It is so light and slim, and I love the smaller brush attachment for the back teeth and in between teeth. When I am done my teeth feel so clean, like I just had them polished at the dentist! So far I like this toothbrush way more than the Sonicare, which was too heavy, the brush head was too large for my liking, and when you take it out of your mouth to spit, you (and the mirror) get splattered. That doesn\'t happen with the Pulsonic. Plus, you can\'t beat the price for the Pulsonic. My boyfriend is getting annoyed with me because every time I use it I tell him how much I love it. HaHa! I highly recommend it, try it for yourself, I promise you won\'t be disappointed."
1561,1599,20090114,B001CX4JSS,2,"January 14, 2009",A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,Good Product Except for the Fatal Flaw,"I was encouraged when I received this toothbrush.  Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife\'s mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a \'clean\' mode and a \'sensitive\' mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars."

I was using a battery operated Oral-B toothbrush previously but I wanted something re-chargeable so I could stop wasting money and batteries.  Since I began using this toothbrush my teeth have never felt cleaner.  It is used just like a manual toothbrush, but it cleans teeth much better.  The price was reasonable too and Oral-B was offering a $15.00 rebate when I purchased it so that made the deal even sweeter.  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who likes to brush his or her teeth the old fashioned way but with a serious power boost.  I have very sensitive gums and teeth and the sensitive setting is perfect...there is little to no irritation.  If you are looking for a reasonable priced rechargeable toothbrush this is the toothbrush for you.  Happy brushing!"

I\'ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them. They were loud, heavy and large in the hand. I was hesitant to try a power toothbrush again, but my dentist suggested it was time to cave and get another. So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush. It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud. I especially like the additional small brush head that comes with it. The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth. The small size of the brush is also great for travel. For short trips I just pack the toothbrush with a regular brushhead cover. For longer trips, I throw in the base and the brush. The base is not too large, so it is not a huge annoyance to pack. My one complaint (and thus the 4 stars) would be that it does not come with a travel case. Seems kind of odd since its size makes it a great travel power toothbrush."

There is a real deal breaker here.The Good: When compared to my Sonicare, this brand actually works better at removing plaque, and I really, really like the little pick brush. It gets into tight areas and along the gum line if you need it to.The Bad: There are problems with this product though. Even on the \'sensitive\' setting, the brushing can be a bit harsh. If it didn\'t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it\'s not. I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation. This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing. Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes. Yes, this one is supposed to beep, but my didn\'t always do that.The Ugly: Then there\'s the deal breaker - the handle is so small and it vibrates so intensely in my hand that it is painful to use on a daily basis. I have carpal tunnel on the right and an old stress fracture on the left, so even though this products does what it is supposed to do very well, I will continue to use my larger grip, smoother running Sonicare on  a regular basis and this product only once in  awhile for a \'spit polish.\' I would not recommend this product for anyone with large hands, previous or current hand injury or nerve damage, or any one with arthritis."

And I have had problems knowing when it needs to be recharged, as electrical outlets in my bathroom are in high demand, and there\'s no way of knowing when you\'re about to run out of juice.That said, the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great deal more efficient than the old \'analog\' toothbrushes most of us grew up with.  It does a better job of hitting hard-to-reach areas than I do in the morning (!) and my whole mouth feels pretty invigorated after using it.The main concern consumers should have is the value for money one.  This is a pretty great deal when more powerful tooth-cleaning systems can cost more than $200.  You lose a little power by buying this item, which says for $33 or so.  But it\'s portable (I travel a lot) and I find it a good value."

While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.ADVANTAGES:Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It\'s not the most powerful brush I\'ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.DISADVANTAGES:Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it\'s nice to have the option and this one does not.Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it\'s power would rate 3 stars.OTHER COMMENTS:Does it whiten teeth?  It\'s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.  I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me."
1588,1628,20080925,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 25, 2008",A3DOPYDOS49I3T,Small and lite....,The Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very lite compared to other power brushes I have used. It is also nice and small. It comes with one regular brush head and a precision tip brush head. The precision tip works really nice to clean in between teeth especially the hard to reach back teeth. It has a clean and sensitive speed. I can\'t really tell the difference between the two but if you have sensitive teeth I am pretty sure you will. It also comes with a charging stand. It is small and holds to brush heads. It has a small profile so it wont take up a lot of counter space. It also has a mount where you can screw two nails on the wall and mount the stand on the wall. The brush does a great job of cleaning my teeth. Especially between the teeth using the precision tip. The brush heads are very easy and fast to switch. It is simple to clean. Overall I like the brush. A travel case would have been a nice companion to this set.
1592,1633,20080917,B001CX4JSS,3,"September 17, 2008",A2X7NBUETXC19E,"Cool design, but needs more muscle","I\'ve tried and was fairly satisfied with my previous electric toothbrushes (both Sonicare products by Phillips), but I was intrigued enough by the slim design and low price point of Oral-B\'s new Pulsonic brush to give it a try.The Good: I love the Pulsonic\'s slim, lightweight design. I didn\'t weigh them, but the Pulsonic is definitely lighter than my Sonicare brush. I also appreciate the fact that the Pulsonic comes with an extra brush head for deep cleaning, along with the standard charger. The basic brush head\'s shape does more for me than the Sonicare\'s as well.The Bad: Unfortunately, I just never felt like the Pulsonic was vibrating/cleaning as hard as my Sonicare. Instead of holding it in place and letting the brush do the work, the Pulsonic requires a fair amount of manual manipulation, during which the brush head can disengage from the main unit.The Verdict: It\'s slicker and cheaper than the competition, but in this case I think you\'re better off spending your money on the deeper cleaning, more reliable Sonicare line."
1595,1636,20080908,B001CX4JSS,3,"September 8, 2008",AM7EU19LRU2SG,I prefer oscillating brushes,"This toothbrush is very slim and light, but yet powerful. The first time I have tried it, it felt a bit unpleasant, but I have gotten used to it very quickly. The best thing about this brush is the bigger brush head as compared to Oral-B Triumph. The brush allows you to use twice as much toothpaste (I have always been concerned that I was not using enough toothpaste with round Oral-B brushes), and it seems that it cleans teeth faster on flat surfaces. Getting into corners requires as much effort as with any other toothbrush.What I did not like: the charger is big and you cannot remove extra brush holders; to turn it off you have to push the power button twice (the first time it switches to sensitive mode); you are supposed to use it in a circular motion, and I tend not to be very good at it. In old days I had problems with traditional toothbrushes as I used to move them up and down and ended up scratching my teeth, so I am afraid this might happen with this brush as well. Finally, the description promises whiter teeth in two weeks, but I cannot see any difference."
1597,1638,20080904,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 4, 2008",A1ZM846Y7AUYD,A Breakthrough in Power Toothbrush Design,"I have used many different power toothbrushes over the past several years.  All have been from the Sonicare and Oral-B line of products.  I have been amazed at how the technology and design of these products have changed over the years.  They continue to get smaller, more powerful, and now tend to include multiple operation modes and interchangeable brushes and accessories.  Although there is clearly nothing wrong with scrubbing your teeth the traditional way, with a good old-fashioned toothbrush, I find that the power toothbrushes tend to remove stains better and keep my teeth whiter.Gone are the days when a power toothbrush was a rather bulky, noisy product.  Oral-B has introduced a new, extremely slim, power toothbrush that is not much bigger than a traditional (manual) toothbrush.  The new Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is truly a breakthrough in power toothbrush design.  Weighing a mere 1.8 oz., with the brush head attached, the dimensions of the handle and brush assembly is roughly 8 1/4\' long and only 11/16\' (just under 3/4\') around at the thickest part of the handle.  The brush head is about 2/3 of the width and 3/4 of the length of a traditional toothbrush.  The charging base measures approximately 1 3/4\' - H x 1 5/8\' - W x 3\' - D.  While I like the small footprint of the charging base, I find it a bit too light, which causes it to slide around on the countertop too easily.Some of the manufacturer boasted features of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush are as follows:* Provides Gentle Sonic Vibration - More than 27,000 Vibrations per Minute* Multiple User Modes:  Clean (normal) and Sensitive* Super-Thin Bristles for Precision Cleaning, Polishing  and Whitening*  Professional Timer, Providing Tactile Feedback at 30-second Intervals for Changing Quadrants of Your Mouth, and Once the Dental Expert Recommended 2-minute Brushing Time Has Been Reached* Provides Up To 30 Minutes Of Use Between Charges* Reduces Up to 94% of Surface Stains in 2 Weeks* Lightweight Slim Handle Provides Effective Maneuverability and Control* Warranty:  2-Year LimitedThe current Pulsonic S15 kit includes the following items:-  Oral-B Pulsonic Power Handle- One Standard Pulsonic Brush Head- One Precision Tip Brush Head- Charging Base w/ Brush Head Storage- Instruction Manual- Misc. Warranty and Registration PaperworkSetting up and using the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush couldn\'t be any easier.  The small charging base simply plugs into an available A/C outlet and sits on your countertop.  Although the instruction manual doesn\'t specifically mention anything about mounting the charging base, there are two slotted holes on the backside, which would allow for wall mounting.  Once the charging base is plugged in you simply sit the Pulsonic Power Brush handle into a recessed opening on the front of the base.  As with most rechargeable products these days, you must initially wait several hours for the device to charge before you begin using it.  The Pulsonic toothbrush requires 12 hours on the charging base before it is fully charged.  The instructions do not say anything about using the toothbrush before it is fully charged, so I guess one could try it out within an hour or two if they wished.  There are two other recessed openings on the base, to allow for storage of the included Precision Tip brush head and a spare standard brush head.  The front of the toothbrush handle has a single power/mode button and three indicator lights.  Two of the LED indicators show what cleaning mode the brush is in, when powered on (clean or sensitive), while the third LED lights up when the device is charging.  A single push of the power/mode button activates the power toothbrush in \'Clean\' mode, while a second push of the button switches the toothbrush into \'Sensitive\' mode.  Pushing the button a third time powers the toothbrush off.  Therefore, if you push the button once, and use the standard clean mode, you will need to push the button twice more in order to power the device off.Unlike the typical oscillating head type power toothbrushes that Oral-B is known for, which require the user to simply hold the head on each tooth for cleaning, this Pulsonic model requires you to move the head around in a circular motion while cleaning.  This can take a little getting used to if you are more accustomed to the oscillating brush-type models, like I am.  There is no need to scrub your teeth with the Pulsonic toothbrush.  You simply move the brush head gently over your teeth (in the aforementioned circular motion), letting the sonic vibrations perform the work of cleaning and polishing your teeth.  Although these vibrations are fairly gentle, switching to the sensitive mode reduces the strength of the vibration by about 1/3.  The vibration speed remains the same, but the intensity becomes gentler and feels less abrasive against your teeth.  While brushing, the Pulsonic toothbrush provides a short stutter (a single break in vibration), at 30-second intervals, to let you know that you are supposed to switch quadrants in your mouth.  Once you have brushed for the professionally recommended 2-minutes, a longer stutter (two breaks in vibration) can be heard and felt.  This form of tactile feedback is quite effective in keeping the user informed as to the status of their brushing session.Once you have finished brushing with the Pulsonic toothbrush, cleanup is a snap.  You simply run the brush head under water and rinse thoroughly.  To better clean the top portion of the toothbrush handle, you can easily remove the brush head attachment by turning the head counter-clockwise (about 1/4 turn) and lifting it off the handle.  The top portion of the handle can be rinsed under running water, but it is not recommended to run water over the lower, controller portion of the handle.  Reinstalling the brush head onto the handle is as simple as lowering it into place and giving about a 1/4 clockwise turn.  You will hear and feel it click into place.  Cleaning the charging base is just as easy.  Since you should never get the electrical portion of the charger base wet, Oral-B has designed the base with a removable top, which can then be cleaned under running water.  To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  After cleaning the removable portion, you can wipe the bottom portion of the base with a dry cloth.  To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  She has been using it regularly and has given me the following pros and cons for this Pulsonic model:Pros******- Extremely slim and lightweight.- Comfortable to hold and is well balanced- Very quiet operation- Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth & gums- Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth & gums- Easy to use and clean- Perfect size for travel- Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work- Charging base takes up very little space on the countertopCons*******- Charging base slides around countertop too easily- No low battery warning indicator- No indication of when charging is complete- Spare brush storage is not covered- No travel/storage case includedMy wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  She has stayed away from power toothbrushes in the past because she didn\'t like the fat handles, noisy operation, and uncomfortable brush heads.  Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  She doesn\'t like leaving the brush heads exposed, so she keeps the spares in a drawer, due to the lack of covered brush storage on the base.  She also wishes that the charging base was weighted, so that it wouldn\'t slide around on the counter so easily.  She informed me that she wants the base mounted to the wall so she doesn\'t have to continue dealing with it sliding around.Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife\'s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B\'s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  I was very tempted to give this Pulsonic toothbrush a 5-star rating, but I honestly feel that Oral-B has overlooked a few important details that will hopefully be corrected on future model releases.  First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don\'t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  The charging base either needs to be weighted or should have better griping foot pads to prevent it from sliding all over the place.  And why they don\'t have a low battery indicator on this toothbrush is anyone\'s guess.  Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  Since the Pulsonic is the perfect size for travel, including a travel case would make perfect sense.  Hopefully they will at least offer a Pulsonic travel case, as an optional accessory, in the near future.  My wife and I consider the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush a 4 and 1/2 star product, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powered brush but doesn\'t want the typical fat-handled, noisy products that have always been the norm."
1598,1639,20080904,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 4, 2008",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,The new aesthetically pleasing brush,"Before I received the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush I was using the conventional, bulky, sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare).  Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  The Pulsonic is about the same size as a manual toothbrush, which is much smaller than all electronic toothbrushes currently on the market.  This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom (even the charger is not the usual eyesore).  Now to the nitty gritty, what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  Nothing, except unwanted complexities.  The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren\'t familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  This takes the place of the usual multi-button brush with a variety of settings, only one of which you actually wind up using.  The Pulsonic comes with one standard brush head and one precision head that has a brush area about the size of a toothpick and stiffer bristles.  The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  This is designed to help you spend the right amount of time in the four quadrants of your mouth, and has always seemed silly to me, but after using it for a while I am following the routine without even thinking.  The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very \'natural,\' and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter. Overall, the brush does everything a sonic brush should, none of the things I think it shouldn\'t and it takes up less space and looks great.  The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  If you\'re looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B."

Well, I found out what sonic action is,even on the low setting, with very little noise, about a 2 on the 10 scale.I\'m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head) whatever off your teeth,but, if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?I decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional 1000.That\'s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes) cleans all surfaces very well,very quickly because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was over doing.However, the noise for it is about a 4."

The timer-mechanism is pretty cool (every 30 secs) and lets you know when to switch quadrants of your mouth.  Also notifies you after 2 minutes has spanned.

It has a 2 minute timer and every 30 seconds it changes up the vibration so you know when to switch to a different area in your mouth.  It has two settings and one is softer for gums or when you\'re just starting out using it.  It\'s not a really loud one and it doesn\'t need any batteries, it has a recharger.  I\'m able to charge it up and take it on a long weekend and it works just fine.  It comes with a smaller brush for getting along your gums.

I was so excited to receive it and tried it right way. It is slim and light weight but it was not nearly as powerful as the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush which I am currently using. It vibrates right on your hand and makes your hand tremble and it gets slippery when it gets wet while you brushing your teeth.  As compact toothbrush for travel, it didn\'t come with a world voltage charger.

I am very tired of spending 50$ or so a year on new brush heads between my wife and I.  I had her try this brush out for 2 weeks to see if she could tell the difference between the two, and she could.  She said it did not feel nearly as powerful, nor did it clean nearly as well. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the form, and feel of the toothbrush.  If you simply cannot, or do not want to spend the money on the sonicare then I might buy this toothbrush.  I contacted oral b to ask if they offer a money back guarantee, which sonicare does. Oral b said they did not offer the guarantee on this model, but only on a couple of other models.  FIGURES!  The lady was polite, but I told her I was upset that I wasted my money on their product, and I will not be buying from them in the future.  We just bought a new sonicare base and it was within 4$ of what I spent for this brush, so you can no longer argue that they are in different categories.

I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I\'m lucky enough to have a window and sill.For that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don\'t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life. And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all. The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical. But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again. I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).In my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months. Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don\'t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B."

Had this been sitting in a warehouse somewhere?  The rubberized materials did not respond to pressure.  The plastic end was immobile.  Pliers didn\'t help.  I thought of using my teeth as gripper, but doubted that would be good for my dental health.  I finally pried the end off with the back of a fine-bladed knife.  The interior was not marked with the customary + or - signs for the battery placement.  It appeared that the wire springs were at one end, so I inserted batteries side-by-side pointed together.  Again, Bad move!  After replacing the end piece with difficulty, of course the appliance would not turn on.  Then I found a one sentence instruction of how to place the batteries -- on a corner of cardboard inner packaging.  Well done, Oral-B -- you hid that quite successfully!  Of course, this time removing the end piece proved impossible.  I thought of returning this piece of junk, but Amazon accepts returns unopened only & in original packaging.

So, we decided to give a try.As a toothbrush, it works differently from Sonicare and at the beginning we liked it quite more. But after a while, I\'m not sure which one I like more. In either case, it does job done. I would not suggest buying the fancy timer though.However, this one died in a half a year. By itself, one sample is not a statistic. But customer support was quite less friendly and we had to ship the toothbrush with papers for \'repair\'. At the end, we\'ve got a new one - but is was much more painful.Bottom line: I would rate the toothbrush about the same as Sonicare, quite worth customer support and (so far) same poor reliability.

I am able to eat with relative abandon again (after getting braces) once I learned how to use the SmartSeries 5000 properly and in a systematic way.The SmartSeries 5000 (with an ortho brush head and power tip attachment) has made brushing and cleaning with braces on extremely easy and a no-brainer.The kit includes a handy travel case (with holders for two attachments), lightweight charger, and timer which links wirelessly to the toothbrush.I usually start with the power tip which is very effective in cleaning debris around brackets and between the wires.  To clean with the ortho brush head, simply press it in front of each tooth and count slowly to twelve -- going from the rear molars to the front teeth on each side on both top and bottom rows of teeth. After that, just brush the biting surfaces and rear of the teeth.Overall, the kit components were very useful to me except for the timer.The timer would display a ring which represented the top and bottom rows of teeth.  The ring was split into four sections and the timer would indicate the amount of time needed for each quadrant of teeth.  It was somewhat tricky to clean by the quadrant and just easier for me to use a fixed count for each tooth."

I got the idea to try to replace the battery but the case has no easy way of opening and my attempt resulted in a shattered case -- it went in my batteries-to-be-recycled bag. I have an Oral-B Vitality I got cheap for under $20 over a year ago because I like to have more than one electric toothbrush (big house). However, it\'s action seemed primitive to me compared to my Sonicares, so I started shopping. Costco has a current coupon on a pair of Sonicares but I decided to look online and see what I could find out and/or buy.I decided on the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 in spite of the fact that there appears to be no rebate available for it at this time. The reasons I decided on the 5000 are several. Firstly, it appears to be not difficult to replace the battery when the time comes. The replacement batteries are easily found on ebay and several of those listings (and other YouTube videos) feature  detailed instructions on how to do the replacement. You do have to use a solder iron, but I\'ve been handy with one since I was a teenager, so no big deal. I would not buy another Sonicare if I thought it might not be possible to replace the battery.Why get the best Oral-B going in spite of the price? I am a frugal guy, extremely so, but in this instance I figure it\'s time to splurge. I have only one set of teeth. The dentist does not scare me, nor the oral surgeon, but I know that the bills can come to literally thousands of dollars. If I obsess a little on my oral hygiene, so much the better! My wallet, teeth, breathe and smile will all benefit! Oh, and my general health. Oral health is a very important part of one\'s overall health.I discovered that the extra brushes I bought for my Oral-B Vitality will work fine with my 5000, cool!The Smart Guide? Well, it\'s OK, it\'s a plus, but no biggie. The biggest advantage of it is if you use more than one mode. It shows you which brushing mode you are using, and it is possible to be in a mode you didn\'t know you were in unless you glance at the Smart Guide. This happened once to me already. I hadn\'t intended to use other than the default mode, but I\'d inadvertently pressed the mode advance button.When I got the 5000, it had no charge and I set it in the charging cradle but nothing happened and I thought maybe the battery was bad. I\'d looked at the instructions on charging but hadn\'t read down to the short paragraph where it says that the battery icon on the handle\'s LCD may not appear for 10-15 minutes the first time you charge it. I still hadn\'t seen that part of the instructions when I got the idea to place the handle in the charging cradle of my Sonicare brush, thinking the Oral-B\'s might be inoperative. Just a second or two in that cradle gave the battery enough oomph to show the battery icon, I then charged it fully in the Oral-B\'s cradle and everything\'s been fine since.The Sonicares I had would pulse briefly every 30 seconds and turn off after 2 minutes. The Oral-B does the every-30-second pulsing, but keeps on going when the 2 minutes is up. I like the fact that the Oral-B keeps on going and lets me decide when I want to turn it off.I picked up mine off ebay for about $12 less than the lowest price I\'ve seen here. The price here has varied by about $10 (i.e. 10%) just over the last week. If I were in no hurry I\'d have waited for another 50% off rebate offer, however.You have to insert the brush in your mouth before turning it on so as not to spray toothpaste all over.  Likewise, you have to turn it off before removing it from your mouth. After doing that, I place it under running tap water, and while holding it under the stream of water I turn on the brush for a few seconds and let it clean itself of toothpaste, then turn off the tap leaving the brush running for a few more seconds to let it shake off most of the water so it will dry quickly.I\'ve always brushed before flossing. I always use a dental pick as well (strongly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist, it\'s the end of a round toothpick, held in a handle called the \'perio-aid 3\', given me by my dentist). A couple of days ago I started wondering if I should really brush first and did an Internet search on the subject and found out that brushing is recommended to come last because dislodging plaque from the tooth/gum-line gives your fluoride toothpaste access to the tooth surfaces, re-mineralizing those surfaces, making them more resistant to decay. So, now I\'m brushing last."

Minus 1 for including a display that raises the cost of the product without providing any additional value.After just a week of use my teeth feel much cleaner - especially on the backsides / insides.Every 30 seconds it vibrates differently for a few moments to let you know to move on to the next section of teeth.At two minutes it vibrates differently for about a second to let you know that you\'re done.However, I don\'t see the point of the wireless display. I\'m too busy watching my teeth in the mirror to be looking at the display. There\'s nothing the display can tell you that the toothbrush doesn\'t already, so just go for the cheaper version without the display."

Even my gums are looking healthier.I almost went with the 4000, but am glad I spent a few bucks more for the 5000, because that little clock/timer thing has, for the first time, gotten me to really pay attention to how long I brush, and I dutifully do the full 30 seconds on each quadrant.From what I\'ve read, the only thing to really watch out for are counterfeit brush head replacements.Would I buy this toothbrush again?

When I first got it, I was so eager to use it that I didn\'t wait for it to charge fully. I only got about 30 seconds of brushing before the thing died and I was forced to curb my enthusiasm and wait for it to charge. However, after the 30 seconds of using it, I could already feel a huge difference. My teeth felt as polished and clean as they were after a professional hygienist worked on them for 30 minutes. When it was fully charged, I tried again and can I just say WOW. That toothbrush packs a heavy punch. It\'s very high powered, which is just what I need to get all the daily grossness off my teeth.I bought the toothbrush during Oral-B\'s discount, but I would definitely buy the toothbrush without the discount. After trying this only once, I\'m already in love.The only complaint I have is with the time it took for the toothbrush to actually arrive at my house. That\'s hardly worth knocking down the rating to four stars though.If anyone has doubt about whether or not it\'s worth it, I would encourage them to get the toothbrush while the discount is still valid. I\'ll be singing praises about this brush for a long time to come, and I\'ll have an awesome smile to go with it! :)"

Would recommend to anyone who doesn\'t have an electric toothbrush or needs to get a new one! I ordered the retail version (should have gotten the Frustration Free which came with extra brush heads!).It comes with this extra guide that counts to 2 minutes (which is the optimal brushing time) and flashes a smiley face after you\'re done. I don\'t really use it, since the brush reminds me of the time every 30 seconds by stuttering for a couple seconds. After 2 minutes it stutters a little more to let you know that you\'ve been brushing for 2 minutes.The other triangular button on the brush lets you switch between modes: normal, sensitive teeth, and whitening? I\'ve only used normal, but the different modes would be great for people who may have sensitive teeth!I LOVE this toothbrush. My teeth are noticeably whiter and definitely less tartar-y.BUY IT! Highly recommended! Amazon shipped my product super fast too, props to them! Got an extra 50% off rebate from Oral-B as well. Actually waiting for it, but the 50% off Rebate promo ends September 15, so get on it!

It arrived within 7 days and I\'ve been using it ever since.  I originally had planned on purchasing a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush but after reading many different reviews, decided on the Oral-B instead.  The clock/timer is a nice feature, makes me more aware of how much time I spend on different sections of teeth.  The motor hesitates when too much pressure is applied which is also a plus for me as I have a tendency to press too hard.  I\'ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don\'t use the stand that it came with but it\'s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn\'t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I\'ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.  Also, I already received my refund card from P&G as well, which was much quicker than some other people had reported in their reviews.

I left the toothbrush in the charge station and checked on it hours later. it is still unresponsive, nothing on the LED screen on the brush except being tempered with water moisture.Until now, I realized it is 100% designing flaw from Oralb because I experienced the same problem with my last 2 Oralb toothbrush.

I am obsessed with using it, for the FULL two minutes because of the just-been-to-the-dentist feel. I opted for the 55000 for the \'gimmicky\' timer which I absolutely love. When I travel I leave the timer at home and I always forget how long I\'ve been brushing. Is that vibrate the 2nd...or 3rd one? I can never remember because I usually try to do something else as I\'m brushing my teeth. So, for me, I love the timer.I love the feel of the 5000 over the 4000 (I bought my mom the 4000 for Christmas and she bought my Dad the same one).I always use the Floss Action head, it\'s by far my favorite.I was hoping this toothbrush would be a little quieter than it is but it\'s not outrageously loud. We have a master en-suite and with the bathroom door closed all the way and the rest of the house silent you can hear the toothbrush in the bedroom but it\'s not loud enough to wake my husband or myself up.I do share the handle of this toothbrush with my husband. Like some other reviewers have mentioned our battery life is not so great anymore. We can \'justbarely\' make it a week without having to recharge. It takes about 8-9 hours to charge fully.My biggest complaint is that within the last few weeks the red light on the timer (pressure sensing light) is almost continually on when we are using the toothbrush. I do need to find the manual and see if there\'s a way for us to calibrate or reset something. The toothbrush is still operating fine but I\'m afraid this issue is a sign of an impending serious malfunction."

I really like the timer, although frankly it is not necessary as your regular wrist watch would work just fine.

It takes a few days to get used to not using the same rigorous back and forth brushing action, but you get used to it. The secret is in the reciprocating action that allows the brush to get between teeth in ways a normal brush cannot. It also cleans those tough back molars extremely well. The included charger is also 110-220v which is a nice feature for someone who travels a lot and lives in Europe like myself. I was also a little apprehensive about the wireless timer/clock, but after using it for awhile it makes a lot of sense and I like using it. I wish they would include an alarm clock or multiple timezones in future iterations to make it more travel friendly and usable. If there were any downside to this toothbrush it would be in it\'s travel \'footprint\'. Although the case is very nice and holds the brush and two heads, its much larger than a regular brush and will take up more space while traveling. The additional wireless timer adds additional packing requirements (which is why I recommend that they add some more features to the clock to make it more usable and travel friendly). If you don\'t travel much, then the size will be fine for your bathroom and the included stand is nice, functional, and compact. Overall, I strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to bring their oral hygiene to the next level. It\'s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but I guarantee your teeth will feel considerably cleaner and look whiter after using it for only a week or two. Great product!"

Oral B has discontinued the Sonic line.  So, I tried the Professional Care/Smart Series - what an improvement!  I like it much better than the Sonic Complete.  It brushes much more thoroughly.On the downside, it is a bit louder (not a big deal) and the RPM drops noticeably as the days go by until I recharge it.  (I don\'t leave it in the charger after every use, only when the battery is almost dead).I went with the 5000 over the lower models because the price was insignificantly higher at the time.  I will admit that I don\'t use the advanced features that the 5000 has over the lower models.  The massaging and other brushing modes don\'t impress me; I just use the regular mode.  (I used to use the soft mode on the Sonic Complete, but I don\'t have a problem with the aggressiveness of the regular mode in the 5000).  The clock/brushing timer is interesting for the first couple of weeks, but now I totally ignore it.  Kind of nice to have a clock in the bathroom when you are getting ready for work, that\'s the only benefit.

The cost was less than other sites searched and came with a rebate. I love the timer which lets you know when 2 minutes of brushing are completed.

The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare\'s."

Being able to see the brushing guide combined with the indication from the brush itself telling me when to continue on to the other \'quadrant\' of teeth is super effective. I didn\'t realize how scantily I\'d been brushing in the past until I used this device. And WOW do my teeth ever feel clean and polished!

After reading a bunch of online reviews, I settled on the Braun/Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 brush and some extra replacement heads. Upon receiving the toothbrush, I was a little surprised at how large the handle is, but the brush heads are small enough to move around and focus on one tooth at a time, which is awesome. The polishing head is amazing, with the right toothpaste it feels like a dentist\'s cleaning! The flossing head seems to do its job, the long rubber flappers seem to reach further into the crevices between my teeth than an average toothbrush, although it is no substitute for actually flossing. Within the first couple days of owning this toothbrush I can already notice a difference in  my teeth, they feel amazingly clean and already look a touch whiter.

This brush is simply light-years beyond the old Oral B 3D! It seems more powerful and even more effective (another plus: this model can use the same brushes [Oral B Precision Clean] as my older model, so leftovers won\'t go to waste. This model also accepts other more specialized Oral B brushes).Many thanks to B. Johnson for pointing out the value of the SmartGuide. For me as well, it serves as a neat little bathroom clock. But the most surprising thing is that by breaking down the recommended two-minute brushing cycle into four groups of 30 seconds each (via a simple but effective circular visual cue), the SmartGuide makes the entire process seem to go by faster. (With old-style brushes, the usual two minutes of unstructured brushing casts you upon a veritable ocean of time. I was always surprised by how long it took for the brush to stutter its two-minute signal. Oftentimes, I just stopped when I felt like it!) You always know (1) exactly where you are in the cycle and (2) when to move on to the next quadrant. This unwittingly clever bit of psychology gives you a sense of making clearly defined progress and ensures that you\'re devoting equal time to all sectors of your mouth. I brush for the full two minutes now, with no sense of impatience. In fact, the experience is so pleasant that I almost always do a final general sweep for another 30 seconds or so.One more interesting detail: perhaps because of its higher speed, this brush seems to prevent water and toothpaste from dripping along the brush shaft. I used to have to put my chin up to minimize this minor annoyance with the old Braun. But after several weeks of using the 5000 (with chin still up but not so extremely), I\'ve not had a single drip.I\'ve always been a faithful tooth-brusher, but ever since I got my first electric brush, brushing has been so much fun that I look forward to it. This terrific toothbrush takes the experience to a whole new level. And most important of all, it cleans and stimulates better than anything else I\'ve ever used."

(2) when accidentally tapping the back of the brush on your tooth, it is not as \'jarring\'.  (3) auto-pause feature when applying too much pressure;  i have been over aggressive on the gums when brushing manually.*WHY YOU COULD LIVE WITH SERIES 1000:i bought this 5000 at a good price driven by an impulsive \'get the most expensive/best\' psyche.  honestly, (1) the timer is useless, i usually brush from 2-3 minutes regardless.  (2) the different modes (massage, gentle, extra clean) are useless.  its like buying a sports car with a \'comfort\' and \'luxury\' suspension settings--do you ever switch it to those?

Though the Sonicare was easier to reach the back teeth.  Both delivers a clean, smooth just left the dentist feeling.This thing is way thicker then my old Sonicare E series handle, the pictures on amazon don\'t show the side shots.  And compared to the latest and greatest sonicare, it\'s probably double the thickness.  Go to your local retail store to compare, if thin is in for you.The smartguide clock thing is pretty heavy and thick as well, keep that in mind if you want to find some way of wall mounting it.  If you have it free standing on your sink its hard to read unless your eye level (I\'m 6 3) or stand back a foot or two.  And , although some of the back is rubberized, it won\'t lean against your wall without falling.  I use fun tack to overcome this.  It comes with two sets of AA batteries, which was pretty worrysome to me because most companies don\'t even give one set but it is still going strong.  It\'s neat to know how far in you\'ve brushed and when to switch quadrants, and the \'studder\' helps better then the audible sound the sonicare makes. Smartguide will count up and down for you.Brush heads seems much cheaper then my sonicare.  A 6 pack in my local warehouse club costs $30.  About $15 for a 3 pk on Amazon, and even cheaper with subscribe and save.It charges a bit quicker then my sonicare.  The charger base is really tiny, takes up very little room.

The difference was immediate. My first visit to the hygienist after two months use astounded her. She told me she had allowed an hour for my cleaning as the calculus buildup on my teeth had been graded C on my visit 6 months previously. She said it was now an A, and was finished in 20 minutes(No discount). She was impressed that the only difference was an Oral B electric with the floss brush-head. As for the 5000 the difference is noticeable. Much longer battery life. Where the 3D was good for 3 minutes and then needed an hour charge. The 5000 will go at least 5 minutes with full power. Probably more. I got bored and ended my experiment after 5 minutes. I also like the fact it is only high speed with a 30 second pulse. I never saw the need for a slower speed option. The 5000 also has an open charging stand, eliminating the gunk buildup the 3D was prone to, and taking less counter space. As for the clock, I have no idea what it\'s for. Set up is simple. Just plug in the charger and set the brush on. The display will let you know when you\'re ready to go. And best of all you can\'t screw it up. The battery will hold a full charge whether you brush 1 minute or 5. No worries about running it down to achieve full charge like many cell phones.

I am in love! I never thought I would like a toothbrush as much as I do this one, but it just cleans my teeth so well! I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth from when I had braces, and I also have a couple of bridges that are both such a  pain to keep clean, but not anymore! Great buy!

Crappy Amazon Customer Service,"NOTE: The product is actually 5 stars but I\'m giving this review 1 star for Customer Service. I figured if it was 1 star... perhaps, Amazon checks the reviews and will read this! HUMPH!Regarding the product, 5 STARSI\'ve used the Sonicare E Series for years (probably almost a decade by now). I somehow managed to get periodontal gum disease about 3 years ago. My dentist found no physical cause for this (as I\'m young, do take care of my teeth and gums, and my medical exams/blood tests have all turned up fine). Anyways, after brushing my teeth with the Sonicare, I usually still see visible plague (sticky white residue) on some of my teeth/gums... no matter how much I aim the toothbrush at my gums, etc. Also, since my mouth is small, I always feel that the toothbrush doesn\'t really get the back of my four top front teeth (central & lateral incisors), due to the shape of the toothbrush. My hygienist has always favored Oral B for its smaller shape but I always thought Sonicare was the best that was out there. Anyways, I decided to switch over since our Sonicare was dying and Oral B had a 50% off promotional rebate. Sweet deal!!! After the very first use of this Oral B toothbrush, I didn\'t see any visible plaque! My next dentist appt. is in Feb., so I\'m extremely curious to see if my dentist and hygienist notices any improvements!Regarding Amazon\'s Customer Service, 1 STAR and that star is for the CS Agent #4 that assisted me (He/she really gets 5 stars... all other CS Agents get 0 stars!)So, Oral B\'s website clearly stated that the 50% off promotional rebate was valid for purchases from Sept. 1st through Nov. 30th. It also stated: \'participating online retailers will provide a printable rebate form with purchase\' and listed Amazon as a participating online retailer. However, the \'rebate forms for recent purchases\' link (at the top of Amazon\'s product description) provided us with a PDF link to an older rebate (valid for purchases by Oct. 31st). Also, when we clicked on the \'instructions\' link and followed the steps to see if any of our purchases qualified for a rebate, it came back saying that our Oral B purchase didn\'t qualify for any rebates. (We decided to go this route before contacting CS in the hopes that we could obtain the correct rebate through a different method on Amazon\'s website.)So, I contacted Amazon\'s CS via chat, tell them my problem, provided the links to Amazon\'s product page and Oral B\'s product page (for their reference) and requested that they send me the new and/or correct rebate form. Here goes my frustration:- CS Agent #1: Reads my message, puts me on hold to research, comes back and tells me that my problem is that the rebate was for purchases made by Oct. 31st and I didn\'t qualify since I purchased the product in Nov. DUH! I KNOW THAT! I proceed to resend him the link to Oral B\'s site that clearly stated the new promotion and that Amazon was a participating online retailer. CS Agent #1 tells me \'We support a wide range of mail-in offers, but this particular offer is a transaction between you and the manufacturer. If you need more help with the offer, I recommend contacting Oral B directly.\' Great. Useless. I asked for a phone number so that I could speak with someone and was provided with an Amazon CS phone number.- Called and spoke with CS Agent #2: Explained my problem, stated that CS Agent #1 was not helpful and if he could please assist. I also explained that CS Agent #1 was not aware of the new promotion, etc. etc. I was again placed on hold while he researched the issue and he also came back with the same line, \'that I purchased the product outside of the promotional offer.\' CS Agent #2 did not have internet access so I requested that he transfer me to a manager that had internet access and could see what Oral B\'s site stated.- Transferred to CS Agent #3 (who was a regional manager): He said that he was sorry that Amazon\'s website stated one thing while Oral B\'s site stated another. He can only submit my request to Amazon\'s marketing team and that they should hopefully send me the correct rebate on Monday (as I had called on a Sunday and Marketing was closed).During all this time (that I was on the phone), I was again on Amazon chat with yet another CS Agent... I figured... I must somehow be able to reach someone that understands and can assist!- CS Agent #4: I explained that I had already spoken to several people, explained my situation and asked that he/she kindly please research the links that I\'m sending before he/she comes back to tell me that I purchased outside of the qualifying promotional period. CS Agent #4 comes back and saves the day! Apparently, if you scroll further down the product page on Amazon, under \'Special Offers & Product Promotions\', is yet another rebate link... this time to the CORRECT FREAKING REBATE! YES! YES! YES! I was so thrilled that I thanked CS Agent #4 profusely. I also asked CS Agent #4 to tell the Amazon web team that the link at the top of the page refers to the old rebate, which is confusing when there\'s another link further down that refers to the new rebate.So, yes, I missed the second rebate link on the product page... but so did the first 3 Amazon CS reps! It took 4 tries to get someone competent to assist me.I also think it\'s pretty incompetent of Amazon\'s web team to 1) Not have the two rebates listed together under the same section... why have multiple rebates available on different parts of the page? And 2) when checking to see if your purchase qualified for any rebates (although a cool feature) was definitely useless in my case as it didn\'t register the fact that the Oral B toothbrush did indeed qualify for a rebate (that was apparently available after all on their website)!Phooey on Amazon for their customer service and web team.Other than this frustrating experience, I do enjoy shopping on Amazon.com... I guess it is safe and hassle free... as long as you don\'t require a rebate or customer service!"

I used to use the Sonicare Elite 9500.3. I just opened the package yesterday evening and have used it twice so far.4. I needed a new brush because my old brush\'s battery died.*Brushing*Pros1. I am happy with the cleaning that I am getting.2. The brush feels like it is massaging my gums.*Charging*Pros1. This brush is dual voltage and will work both in 110v and 220v areas.2. This base of the brush seems much more stable than my  Sonicare since it is a little wider.*Traveling*Pros1. The brush does include a travel case.2. Since the travel case is plastic, it will be much easier to clean though compared to the cloth Sonicare case I had.Cons1. The travel case is MUCH larger than my old Sonicare.2. The travel case appears that it is more likely to break since the plastic hinge area seems like it can wear down.3. The brush heads do not have a plastic cap to help protect the bristles.  I liked that the Sonicare had this option since I was reassured that nothing dirty was touching the bristles while transporting it.*Operation*Cons1. I could not figure out how to get the brush to offer an audible cue when switching quadrants while connected to the SmartGuide.  It only offers an audible cue when the radio is turned off.*Cost*Pros1. This brush is much cheaper than the latest Sonicare.2. Replacement brush heads are much cheaper than the Sonicare (by about half the price).*Maintenance*Pros1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush heads appears that it will be much easier to clean unlike my Sonicare which always had a lot of buildup that was difficult to clean.Cons1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush head is a relatively small metal rod.  I am concerned that if I drop the toothbrush, this may bend and I would be unable to load any brush heads.2. On either side of the brush, there is a section with a silver coating.  Unfortunately, this stains easily with water stains.  I wish that Oral-B had used something that would help avoid the water stains.Overall, I am content with the brush. I wouldn\'t consider myself a Sonicare convert since this isn\'t perfect either, but I plan on keeping this brush."

I previously had the sonicare toothbrush but bought the Oral B on the recommendation of my dentist.  I got the 50% off rebate so the difference in price was about $4.  The separate timer really comes in handy...it doubles as a clock in the bathroom and is handy to see how much time you have left and what quadrant you are on.

I got it when Oral-B had the 50% rebate promo running, and Amazon was selling it for just $99.99.  So getting it for $50 was a steal of a deal.It cleans perfectly and I have noticed whiter teeth in just a few weeks of use.  I will never go back to normal manual brushes and can\'t believe I hadn\'t bought this earlier!  My teeth honestly look and feel healthier than ever and like they all say, it does feel like i just stepped out of the dentist\'s office.  Buy it, it\'ll save you wonders on dental bills and all but ensure you won\'t have teeth problems, gingivitis, etc.  I use the \'sensitive\' mode to brush my tongue as well, and the \'massage\' mode helps strengthen your gums and feels good too.  The extra brush head that\'s included is awesome, and the display helps you see how long you\'ve been brushing, what mode you\'re on, and also functions as an extra bathroom clock :)All in all, very satisfied with this purchase.  My family uses it too with their own separate brush heads (you only need one handle).  The charge lasts about a week with use.  It leaves my teeth spotless and it\'ll do the same for you!"

I don\'t know if newer Sonicare toothbrushes have a different design. I used the Sonicare Elite for many years until the nickel-cadmium battery died. I didn\'t notice the inferior design of the Sonicare until I started using the Oral-B 5000. The Sonicare has fat plastic at the brush end which is not as comfortable as the slim Oral-B brush head. The Sonicare has a fat and elaborate interface between the base and the removable brushing unit, which is not as easy to keep clean as the slim and simple interface of the Oral-B. And the Oral-B brushing part of the two types of brush included in the box does a better cleaning job. Finally, we have battery disposal. The Sonicare has a non-removable Ni-Cad battery, so that in order to dispose of it properly at a recycling center I had to cut the base to access the battery. The Oral-B has a provision for removing the nickel-metal hydride battery (better than Ni-Cad), although the manufacturer wants you to stop using the unit when the battery dies, not to replace it."

However, I didn\'t receive the rebate certificate.  I sent a message to customer service at Amazon.com asking for the rebate slip or an explanation as to why it was not included.  I received no response, and that was about a month ago.As for the toothbrush, it is more powerful than the model I was using previously (also Oral-B) and appears to be more effective.  I liked my old Oral-B but this one is even better.As for Amazon, I am very disappointed.  In future, I will refrain from purchasing items from Amazon that are offered under a rebate.

The two brush heads they give you are both good and have different uses. There\'s one for polishing your teeth form whitening, and there\'s another that really gets into the gum for \'floss-action\'.The little display thing that comes with the brush just basically tells you how long you\'ve been brushing. You can choose it to tell you how long you\'ve brushed or how long you have left. Other than that, it\'s pretty useless, so get the 4000 which comes with the same brush but without this display.

He highly recommended the Oral B.  So I switched and what a huge difference.  It goes around the tooth which is what their instruments do at the dentist.  After using it for a almost 3 months, I can see a huge difference!  My gums and teeth feel clean but not all tore up.  I can\'t wait to go back to the Periodontist and show him the difference in my whole mouth.  The ORal B 5000 has a little digital clock that shows you when you\'re brushing too hard which has made a big difference in the way I brush and a 30 second timer to show you when to switch quadrants.  I\'ve always thought that really scrubbing my teeth was the way to go but not so! This brush shows you how to do it right.

I was getting lazy in brushing and flossing my teeth every night that I would go to sleep without even bothering about it. My visit to the dentist woke me up. I was bleeding from my gums when she probed it. And I had cavities!Now I brush my teeth twice a day and after meals. I brush my teeth at least 2 minutes with the guidance of the SmartGuide or more if I\'m using the Deep Cleaning Mode.I have never been so proud and satisfied of my brushing attitude!!

2416,2472,20100603,B002HWS9GG,3,"June 3, 2010",A1T50IO1EMVNFH,From Sonicare to OralB,"I have been a Sonicare user for the previous 15 years. As a dentaphobe, I will always be grateful to Sonicare for keeping my mouth cavity free for my 7 year hiatus from the dentist- though to be fair, I also drank mostly water (vs. sugared drinks) and made sure to brush and floss twice daily, chewing sugarless gum throughout the day. Still, I found the Oral B a very nice upgrade for several reasons:1. NO ICKYNESS IN THE BRUSH HEAD!!! Sonicare brushes are notorious for getting all this disgusting gunk stuck up inside the brush head, leaving me with a sense of wonder about what exactly I was putting in my mouth, even after rinsing the head thoroughly in alcohol.2. Smaller brush heads. I finally feel like I am cleaning my wisdom teeth, which stick back almost to the uvula.3. Circular brush heads. Dentists always say to brush in circular motions, yet typical Sonicare brushes only go side to side.4. Using the floss-action head truly leaves less behind when I floss right after brushing.5. Another reviewer mentioned the fact Sonicare does not offer either soft bristled brushes or a sensitive mode.There were a couple downsides:1. Noise. The Oral B seems much louder, likely because the brush is moving in a circle vs. just side to side.2. Vibration Speed. One of Sonicare\'s main tenants for their brushes is that the sonic action itself gets rid of plaque/germs. The Oral B does not seem to vibrate quite as much- though flossing seems to yield fewer hangers-on, and does not just compact any recently-eaten food- such as cracker mush.There are other benefits, which Sonicare has also added to its latest greatest brushes, such as timers and better chargers. Still, I am happy with the switch- I\'ll just see if my dentist notices =)UPDATE; 2011- Going back to Sonicare.I had the brush about a year when the battery started dying ALL the time- would go from 3 of 4 bars to 0 bars in the middle of brushing. If you prefer leaving your brush plugged in all the time, this may not be a problem- but I like my batteries to hold some charge.Also, in the end, I do not feel like the brush is cleaning between the teeth as much as a Sonicare. Likely thanks to all the complainers like myself, I\'ve been exploring Amazon and noticing Sonicare has now created smaller brush heads with only the prong attachment/gotten rid of the ick factor of their bigger brush heads, and made the brushes overall less expensive (under $80).In the midst of the year\'s use, I sucked it up and returned to the dentist... to find I had 7 cavities =( While I obviously can\'t entirely blame the Oral B for this result, I again cite that the brush did not seem to clean as well between teeth/I miss the sonic action of the Sonicare- and did leave any late night cracker/chip remnants pushed down on my back teeth. So look for a new review of the latest Sonicare brush soon!"

I thought the Smart Guide device was really for kids, but it is handy and I am glad I got the model with the Smart Guide.  The signal to move to the next quadrant of the mouth is very helpful.  I have taken it on trips up to 5 days and the charge holds fine without recharging.My only criticism is that sometimes when I am holding the handle I will accidently press the button that switches to the next brushing mode.  So I have to make sure I hold the handle low enough.  The handle may be made for a man\'s larger hand whereas with my hand I would like to hold it a little closer to the brush, but that is when I can hit the button.I would definitely buy this again."

NOTE: the annoying part about the smartguide is taking off that darn battery cover! other reviewers weren\'t exaggerating about that at all! the clock on mine is still an hr behind since i couldn\'t remove that stupid battery cover to adjust the time.i\'ve only used two brush heads so far, whitening and floss-action. i\'m not sure if the whitening head really whitens like a whitening strip, but at least mine aren\'t staining even without using whitening toothpaste. the floss-action one doesn\'t really \'floss\' well. when you start off, it might be a good idea to use the sensitive or whitening head since the bristles are softer and more gentle on your gums until you\'re used to the \'power\' of an electric toothbrush.overall, i do love the toothbrush and even bought a couple additional ones for my family as gifts. so, i definitely recommend it."

I brook down and bought the version with the SmartGuide. My thought was what the heck even though I thought I did not require it. I have say that there have been times when I would have stopped brushing before 2 minutes are up because I thought 2 minutes had gone by. Note that the toothbrush pulsates every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants and pulsates three times at the two minute mark, so you don\'t really need the SmartGuide. It is still nice to check while brushing and the clock is a nice feature as well. For Christmas I got my wife the same toothbrush, but it now seems to be called the 5000. I have to say it is hard to figure out all the models and sets Oral-B creates. I told my wife that when you first use the toothbrush you will feel as if your teeth are going to shake right out of your mouth and she agreed. After a couple of uses, you become totally use to the brush. I have read negative reviews in which people stated this toothbrush makes their gums bleed, I can only assume they have gum problems and brushing action was too much for their gums. Without a doubt my teeth are much cleaner with this brush. I am not always good about flossing, and I would notice that when I got around to flossing again after period of not flossing that my gums were sore the following day. I noticed tarter build up as well. With the Triumph/5000, I never notice these problems now. Of course this toothbrush is not a substitute for not flossing, but I feel it really helps if you don\'t always floss. Our kids have now used our toothbrushes as well for the last few months and most importantly they are brushing for a full two minutes. Prior to this my son was closer to bushing for 10 seconds than 2 minutes. I figured too that the newness of the brush would have worn off with them, but they still seem to like it. Battery life is good as well. I get about 11 days between charges, but I also brush between 2.5 minutes and 3 minutes every time I brush. With that factored in I would say a 2 minute brusher would get pretty close to 2 weeks on a charge. Bottom line is this is a great product. So much so that I hauled it with me on an 8-day trip to Europe, and it went in my backpack not my checked luggage. I still take a manual toothbrush on overnight trips, but I sure hate not having this toothbrush with me."

It felt kind of crazy to spend $100+ on a toothbrush, but I had some money in a health spending account to use up. I read a lot of reviews before buying.Pros: My teeth feel very clean after using. It can reach places that a regular toothbrush couldn\'t. The construction feels pretty strong and reliable. I like the external readout, and having a clock in the bathroom is handy.Cons: Expensive.  The feel in the hand is a little big and clunky. All the various speed settings seem a little pointless...probably one or two settings would be fine. The flossing brush head doesn\'t feel like it really flosses/gets between teeth, the polishing brush head doesn\'t seem like it does anything special.  I mostly stick w/ the sensitive brush head.If it lasts me 5 years and results in good checkups, it will have been worth it."

I have resisted this purchase for years, but it has become apparent that I really needed to get one.  Research indicated that this was the best brush as far as effectiveness.I\'m not all that excited about vibrating toothbrushes--reminds me a lot of going to the dentist.  But this really isn\'t so bad.  I was a little skeptical--but after feeling the \'dentist clean\' feeling, I was sold.  I love that the brush stops if i try to brush too hard.  the little display that shows the quadrants and how long you are brushing is a little helpful--although certainly not a selling feature in my book.  funny though, i found as did many reviewers, that this serves as a great bathroom clock!The information on amazon can be a bit confusing.  You get a travel case, charger, 2 brush tips (1 pro white and 1 floss), and the display.The handle is a bit on the large size and i\'m not sure it would be good for children.  I prefer smaller handles, however, they can\'t fit all that computer programming into a smaller handle.You do have to practice a bit at keeping your mouth closed enough that the toothbrush doesn\'t spray.  But it has never been a real issue for me--i would say any spray has been minimal.  And every electric toothbrush has this issue.I prefer the smaller brush head on these to the larger brush heads.  on normal toothbrushes I prefer full size brush heads--but when you have a large handle, it seems much more maneuverable to have the smaller head.  And it doesn\'t feel stranger or bother me--i adapted on first use.When you are done using, it is best to remove brush from handle and thoroughly run it under water.  This can prevent toothpaste from building up.Oral B has a 60 day try it guarantee and will refund your money if you are not happy.  That seems like a good deal."

Prior reviewers have already commented on the power converter that sticks 3 inches out from the electrical wall plug - duh. Also the enigma of how to open the battery compartment of the \'Smart Guide Display unit\'. (TWO covers to be removed with gorilla fingers, sliding each in opposite directions.)Fortunately the rechargeable (Ni-MH) battery in the handle can be replaced (compared to the older Braun models that became useless once the battery died), but how to change the battery is a deeper mystery. (Amidst the very poorly written instructions, the section for replacing the rechargeable battery provides only a small diagram that is utterly unintelligible.) I went to the [...] website and clicked on \'email us\', but what a bad joke that was - I just ended in an endless search option in their FAQ section. Next I\'ll call them at [...].Oh, then you have to remember twice a year to not use the battery charger, so that the battery discharges completely in order to \'maintain the maximum capacity of the rechargeable body\'. (Since a full charge is claimed to last at least 10 days, I suppose one then turns on the toothbrush and leaves it running on the bathroom counter... hoping the internal moving parts don\'t wear out in the process.)CRITICAL: In these days of airline security concerns, if you bring the toothbrush with you (as my dentist recommends), DON\'T FORGET to deactivate the radio transmitter that is built into the toothbrush handle (to communicate with the \'Smart Guide display unit\').In summary: This is a fabulous toothbrush (10x better than my previous Braun model) but a disaster on the \'user friendliness\' scale. I can only hope that in the next few years Braun\'s competition will \'eat their lunch\' with something yet better and much simpler to use!"

But few complains about this specific model 5000.1) The handle on 5000 is much bigger than on other similar toothbrushes. It is less comfortable to hold in hand.2) The extra device coming with model 5000 is useless. It is supposedly an \'advanced\' timer which makes beeping noise when you need to switch sides of teeth to brush and when to stop brusing. I think, timers embedded in the toothbrush handle itself (what they do for less expensive models) do better job - there is absolutely no benefits to have timer separately (in addition it\'s screen is hard to see).3)The electric plug on this toothbrush is much longer than on other models. The base, though, is much smaller. Apparently they moved electronics from the base (where toothbrush stands) to the plug. It does not look good when plug is plugged in recepticle and it makes dificulties always to avoid pushing the plug.4) Another big complain - never received rebate. it was $50 rebate for this toothbrush when I bought it in August. I filled all forms and send them in. But, until today I do not have rebate. I opened case with amazon and will give you update if I get rebate eventually.

Now I look forward to brushing everyday and I also brought one for my wife and three kids.Update:  I went to costco and they had the same tooth but a professional version, which cost more money and works the same.

I do not, however, like the pro white heads that came with the brush. I bought the precision clean heads and love those. They are made to work with the Vitality. This is only packaged and called the Vitality Pro White because it\'s the vitality model with pro white heads... Any heads made for Oral-B will work with this except for the Sonic heads.This brush is great, although it seems it\'s a bit underpowered. When brushing my back teeth and trying to get behind the tooth the motor isn\'t as powerful as it you were just brushing the front teeth but it\'s fine it still does the job just fine. I leave the brush on the charger when not in use so I can\'t attest to how long the battery lasts. Oral-B says that it will last 20 minutes or about 10 2-minute brushing periods. I personally think that\'s low for a modern electronic toothbrush but I leave it on the charger so I don\'t have to deal with a low battery.I brush at minimum 3 times a day. Usually more. I contacted my dentist asking if it was bad and she said that it\'s fine and I told her I was using the Vitality and she said that it was no problem, \'brush as often as you\'d like\'.. So I\'m not worried about gum recession or ruining my tooth enamel with it.I moved from a manual brush to the electronic brush and found at first that the vibrating (oscillating?) was making my gums and the tip of my nose tickelish. I\'ve gotten used to it and it doesn\'t seem to affect me like that anymore.I do drool a lot when brushing and the toothpasty drool goes down the handle on the brush and makes the handle a mess, so I rinse it off half way through and after brushing. The brush is completely waterproof, although I wouldn\'t submerge it...So all in all I really love this brush and rate it a 5/5. We\'ll see in 6 months how my brushing habits are when I go in for my next cleaning. I try to be very thorough and usually brush at least 3 minutes to make sure I get every nook and cranny so if I have tartar that is an unusual build-up I\'ll modify this review.I recommend this brush 100%!"

Ths brush is relatively inexpensive, but it also feels inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.Pros:-It works. The product came out of the package, charged, and worked without a fuss. The worst part of setup was the anti-theft plastic package.-Inductive charging base. The case is 100% waterproof sealed, and power is drawn by setting the brush on a holder base so that power is transferred with no risk of electric shock. Very nice.-The brush pulses a couple of times to let you know when you\'ve done your time. Brilliant.-And it comes with an extra basic brush head.Cons:-Rattles your head like a jackhammer, negating most of the positives the moment it touches your teeth. The motor is relatively slow and cheap, so until you\'ve used it for a while and learned to adapt you\'ll be concerned that it\'s going to knock your teeth out before you\'re done cleaning them.-Standard brush head is only okay. You get the most basic brush head out of the box, which to me feels only so-so for cleaning. I sometimes have to run my brush for an extra cycle to feel really clean.Overall, if you want to try a power brush but you don\'t have the money for a more expensive model, this isn\'t a bad choice- it\'s still better than a manual brush. However, in the realm of power toothbrushes, you can and should do better. When you weigh a lifetime of painful dental cleanings and potential surgical issues from cavities against the (hopefully) one-time investment in a good power brush, there\'s really no reason to stick with an underpowered model like this that\'s going to rattle your teeth like it does.However, I\'m still going to be reusing this model for a long time to come- craft and cleaning experts know that there\'s nothing like a cheap power toothbrush for doing tasks like detail cleaning leather. For this application, this is an absolute wonder of a brush. It\'s cheap, and all the jackhammering works just fine when it\'s done on something other than your head."

The body of the toothbrush is lightweight, it tells me when it\'s time to stop brushing, and the polishing head REALLY gets those black tea stains off my teeth.The polishing head might be a little too vigorous, because it actually hurt my gums in one area where I brushed too hard. But if you\'re careful, this is a great toothbrush head on a fantastic toothbrush. I\'m definitely seeing better results than usual.I also really like the small size of the stand.

I thought that was way better than our manual toothbrushes, but thought I\'d give this a whirl.  It makes a HUGE difference!  For one, the head is much smaller than the SpinBrush.  It\'s just one rotating head, whereas the SpinBrush has a rotating head and another section that goes up and down.  While I thought the rotation wouldn\'t leave my mouth feeling as clean as the double-motion head of the SpinBrush, it actually felt better!  Perhaps the smaller head allows it to get to more places in my mouth, or perhaps it is that the rotation looks, sounds, and feels much faster.  The SpinBrush is battery powered and even with new batteries, I don\'t think the top head spun as fast as this bad boy.  While this toothbrush costs more than the SprinBrush, it\'s still relatively inexpensive and since you can replace the heads, it\'s still a good option for those who don\'t want to spend top dollar on an electric toothbrush.  Overall, I love this toothbrush.  We will see how it stands up over time, but for the week I\'ve been using it, I feel like my mouth is cleaner."

Like Sonicare, this model is using the \'proximity\' charge method where you place the toothbrush\'s body on the base and charging takes place when the base is plugged into an electric outlet.- Extra brush - this model comes with 2 brushes, one mounted on the body and one extra.- Easy brush replacement - you simply pull the mounted brush to take it out, push the new one in.- $3 coupon to be used when purchasing replacement brush heads.Not so good or annoying:- The packaging is atrocious. It comes in one of those bullet-proof clear plastic enclosures that you must cut with scissors and make sure you don\'t cut yourself in the sharp edges while at it. It took me several minutes to extract the contents off packaging and I did manage to do it scratch-free.- Vibrations are a little too strong - this MIGHT be my Sonicare bias (which I\'ve been using for longer than I can remember) but I felt that this VITALITY was a little too aggressive. My teeth are a little bit sensitive and they didn\'t like that.- A little too noisy for what I am used to - of course, an \'ultrasonic\' toothbrush noise is harder to detect because... it\'s ultrasound.When compared to the higher-end products, it may be worth noting that the VITALITY does not come with a \'full\' timer. The toothbrush does tell you when the 2 minutes are up (noise similar to revving an engine) but it does not turn itself off and, more importantly, it does not give you 30-second signals so you can switch \'quadrants\' as the higher end products do.The VITALITY offers a lot for the price but I am not sure that \'price\' is THAT meaningful when the topic is our teeth. It\'s probably preferable to most manual toothbrushes but, for a few dollars more you can get a lot better. Overall this is a decent product but if I had to replace my higher end toothbrush today, knowing what I know after trying out this product I would NOT go for the VITALITY and sacrifice features and convenience. The few dollars saved would not justify it.Three stars, meaning \'It\'s Okay\' seem to be the fair rating on the Amazon scale."

The first thing he said to me after trying was, \'Wow ... it\'s a little aggressive, isn\'t it?\'It IS a little powerful, but boy does it ever get your teeth clean! Both of us noticed after just two or three days that our teeth were noticeably whiter and less stained. They also just FEEL really clean -- that \'just left the dentist\' feeling (the clean part, not the Novocain part).The only reason I\'m not rating this five stars is because it may be too much for those with really sensitive gums, and I\'m also a little curious about what long-term use could do to enamel if you\'re not careful.

We own two, rechargeable, Oral B toothbrush bases and each child and I has our own brushhead that simply snaps on and off.In comparison to brushing with a manual toothbrush, the Oral B electric toothbrush is a far superior brushing solution. You can\'t really compare manual brushing to an Oral B anymore than you can compare a bike to a car.  A bike will get you there, but not as quickly or comfortably as a car. The oral B accesses harder to reach areas of your mouth easier than a manual toothbrush, and the brush spins much faster than you could ever hope to brush on your own.In comparison to other electric toothbrushes, I chose the Oral B because it was far more economical than other brands. It is affordable, and the brush replacement costs are very reasonable, especially when you buy bulk packages here or at a warehouse store.Now, on to this specific Oral B brushhead.  The base unit also works with the standard Oral B brushheads that I already use.  This brush head is slightly more oval shaped to mimic a tooth\'s surface and shape, versus the circular standard brushhead.  It also has a polishing cup in the center of the brush head where brush bristles would normally be present on the standard, circular brush head. So, picture the standard brush head with a polishing cup in the dead center of the brush head and you can get a mental picture of this new brush head\'s design.With the more powerful motor and new brush head, I like this Oral B better than the standard Oral B that I have been using.  It cleans even better and I really like the polishing cup since I am a heavy coffee drinker and try to minimize teeth staining.  While you can\'t go wrong with any of the Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes, I would recommend this one.  If you are still using a manual toothbrush, I would strongly suggest at least trying out an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  If you do, you will never go back to manual brushing again.UPDATE.......After using this brush head for several months now, I am convinced that it has made my teeth more white. I had worked it into my normal brushing routine and had forgotten about it.  I started to notice my teeth seemed whiter, and I couldn\'t figure out why.  I started thinking about it and realized the only change was the brush head and more powerful motor.  (my toothpaste was the same)."

The pulsonic has a light that just shows when it\'s charging.  The pubsonic has a larger brush head but this brush gives a deeper clean, which is also somewhat of a downside due to the noise that\'s produced by the power behind the brush.

I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this product.First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910. This electric toothbrush was great. I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare. My only gripe was the replacements are a bit on the pricy side. Moving on, I decided to replace the Sonicare (gave to my wife) with the Oral-B 3000. My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line. Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.As an owner of both, I find them similar in a sense, that they are both out (the toothbrushes of course) to perform the same job. The Sonicare did its job just fine. However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch. Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it\'s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.Onto the Oral-B. This brush has performed great. The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease) so I don\'t bleed as much. The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare and I really see no difference other than the size of the head. Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean). I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip. Although, it\'s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work. Plus, I always rinse the brush afterwards with hot water.The battery life appears to be great. I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days. The vibration and strength is great the company claims (40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute). The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \'off\'.The toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation. The build quality seems good to me. I have dropped this toothbrush three times over the span of three months and the electric toothbrush survived without any visual damage or cracks.The charging does take quite some time until it is fully charged. However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night. Therefore, the brush has hours of charging before its next use. One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG. This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first. Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit. Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don\'t even really notice it.In closing, I like this toothbrush. I gave it four stars because while I think it\'s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let\'s face it, it\'s a toothbrush right? Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road). Both the Oral-B and the Sonicare, have their difference. But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease. I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I do.And remember, I do NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can\'t go wrong either way."

The toothbrush has a vigorous action, and my teeth feel dentist visit clean after I brush.  The 30 second timer is a nice feature that allows you to spend that amount of brushing time on the four quadrants of the mouth. The 2 minute timer lets you know that the morning/evening ritual is complete.  The storage lid hides the brush heads when not in use, and is a feature that my wife appreciates.  The one negative comment I have is that the package only comes with one brush head, but I suppose that the nice rebate more than fairly offsets the cost of additional heads."

Once I got over feeling like I was brushing my teeth with a swirling brillo pad (a sonic toothbrush head doesn\'t rotate, it just kinda vibrates). I discovered what I have been missing! I brush too hard. There is a light on the back of the toothbrush (so you can see it in a mirror) that comes on when you apply too much pressure. The next thing I discovered was how clean my teeth felt! The Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing plaque between teeth (better than a sonic brush). My mouth is cleaner, my breath fresher, my teeth brighter and I have a happier smile since I switched to Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush!"
2655,2720,20100920,B003UKKHB4,5,"September 20, 2010",A3VYKXHQDICC6,Excellent,"I have been an Oral-B electric toothbrush user for the last 15 years. I have written Amazon reviews for Oral-B products dating back to 2002. I have had very few dental issues in this time although, in fairness, I must also report that I began daily flossing during this time as well, and that may be just as important.This new model is a definite step up from the ancient \'Plak Control Plus\' model that I had been using. It\'s full name is \'Professional Care 3000\' and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument. The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one. Please note that this is not an ultrasonic toothbrush. Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action. The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth very quickly.The 3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button. The first is \'Daily Clean\' which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis. The second is \'Sensitive\' which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth. The third is \'Whitening\' which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \'Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\'The instructions that come with the 3000 recommend that you brush for 2 minutes - no less and no more. To assist you with this, once you turn the brush on it will pulse twice every 30 seconds. If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you\'ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times. To turn the brush off from any mode, just press and hold the on/off button.Built into the 3000 is a \'Hard Brushing Alert\' which is an LED on the handle that lights up if you are pressing too hard. Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth. Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly. The instructions say that the LED is, \'Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\' so apparently there\'s a dental health issue here as well. The brush is very powerful, so it\'s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.The brush comes with a charging stand and covered storage tray that can accommodate 4 brush heads. The storage tray is dishwasher-safe, the charging stand is not."

I brush and floss at least once a day, maybe two if I have time.  Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.Then this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information - you find out that the brush tells you how to time your brushing.  It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  Yes, and further, the brush signals you to change.Quick reminder, after you put the toothpaste on your brush, press it to your teeth before turning it on, otherwise you get to spend some time cleaning toothpaste off the bathroom mirror, walls, and perhaps ceiling.  One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over the entire area - front, bottom, back, and gumline.  After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.  I was impressed.After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  I rinsed, and looked in the mirror.  To my surprise, I could already see a change in my teeth.  It was slight, but noticeable to me.  After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost."

I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  I floss daily and have used a Sonicare electric brush for close to 15 years.  It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  That was a bit much for me.  And my teeth weren\'t that bad, it\'s just that he was very fastidious.  I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  And I ALWAYS swish my mouth out with water after eating or drinking anything.Anyway, when I got the chance to try this Oral-b, of course I was up for the challenge.  When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the other.After trying the Oral-b for a week, I can tell you that I am definitely a Sonicare person.  Here is the breakdown of my experience:Oral-b pros:*Handle feels nice in hand.  It has a silicone/rubbery grip that is ergononimic*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.Oral-b cons:*Way too noisy.  I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  Not a relaxing experience, I felt too stressed with all of the noise, lights, and buzzing.*The depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush head.*It does not stop after 2 minutes of brushing.  I am used to the way the Sonicare handle stops working after you\'ve hit the 2 minute mark.  With the Sonicare if I want to keep brushing after the 2 minutes, I just press the button again.  With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn\'t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  Next bullet point.*Loud humming with surge pulse.  This is Oral-b\'s answer to Sonicare\'s quadrant pacer, where it nudges you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn\'t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!*Single button control. It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.*Cleanliness?  I didn\'t feel like my teeth were any cleaner than they already were when I used my Sonicare.I still believe that liking the Oral-b or Sonicare is a matter of personal preference.  Cost analysis-wise, the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  But I prefer the Sonicare."

Oral B is lower  in price and seems to do the same job Great thing about Oral B is it\'s very lightweight, easily packed for travel and offers a large variety of replacement brushes. The brush itself was harder than I\'d like but they do offer softer ones for those with sensitive teeth. They also offer a brush for those with braces, implants, crowns and bridges. It\'s a bit pricey and I bought it. Once I check it out, I\'ll write a review on that separately. Overall, a reasonably priced product, lightweight. The battery is built in, so you will need to recharge accordingly, most likely once or twice a month. My only gripe is that there is no cover for the brush."

Too Pricey for What it Does, Though","I have SLE and sjogren\'s (another autoimmune disease that has pretty much destroyed my salivary glands).  I do not have enough spit in my mouth, which leaves my gums fragile and my teeth prone to cavities - even in the front.  My dentist is great and is working with me to save my teeth and gums, but I have to stay on top of things.I have been using a sonicare for a couple of years.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The sonic waves sort of pummel out the junk between my teeth and loosen it up even places that the toothbrush cannot physically go.  However, that brush brutalizes my gums and the sonic action sprays stuff everywhere - my sink and mirror look like a crime scene after I brush.  The Oral-b 3000 cleans physically only - no sonic stuff, so it only gets the stuff the bristles can get to.  That amounts to teeth that are slightly less clean in spots than what I get from the other brush.  However, my gums barely bleed at all when I use this on the sensitive setting.If your main concern is gum disease, and you\'re a good flosser, I would recommend this over the sonicare, because you\'ll be able to massage your gumline without damaging good tissue.  Press the start button twice for the sensitive setting, and you\'re good to go.I deducted one star for the price point.  I think a brush this expensive ought to include sonic technology.  Sonicare has the essence for $40 less than today\'s price for the oral-b 3000,  but if you need a decent brush that will not hurt your gums, this is probably worth the added expense.  I give it an 8.5.  It cleans better than the lower-priced oral-b products - almost as well as the sonicare.  The sensitive setting is a really nice feature for people like me with fragile gums. And replacement heads are affordable - much less expensive than the sonicare."

Then again, other dentists have said they\'re nothing special, and careful brushing using a regular toothbrush is just fine. Anyway, I certainly can\'t seen any harm in trying one and after just a few days of use so far, I\'m already beginning to think it was a worthwhile decision.The Oral-B 3000 is easy to use, feels reasonably solid in hand, and is simple to keep clean (it\'s nice that the brush can be removed quickly to rinse out). I was a little nervous the first time I tried it, expecting bleeding gums or soreness, but in fact the opposite has been true. Because there\'s no need to scrub hard, it\'s actually quite gentle, though the sensation is a little strange at first and it took me a few tries to get used to it. I felt it was really getting my gum-line clean, and because they recommend just two minutes (30 seconds per \'quadrant\') I was actually more aware than I usually am with a regular toothbrush about reaching every corner of my mouth and teeth... I guess with no \'instructions\' and years of just using a normal toothbrush, it\'s sometimes easy to forget what we learned as children when it comes to brushing our teeth!So, I\'m happy so far. My mouth and teeth have never felt so clean immediately after brushing (note, that \'clean\' feeling of course quickly disappears once you eat again), though the way the device vibrates against my jaw is a little perturbing, but I\'ll just have to get used to that. I\'d have liked to have seen a few more brush heads supplied with the product as I feel those will get expensive. I noticed the Oral-B site mentions this product coming with four different brushes, but the package states that we only get the one. There appear to be a variety of different brushes available, but I\'m not sure how useful they all are... I\'ll probably stick to just the original one as it already does a better job than a regular brush at polishing my teeth, and I\'m not sure how well the other ones would work. There is one brush with two heads though, that could be interesting to try and might clean even better. Fortunately, these replacement heads are not horribly expensive online, despite being considerably more than a normal toothbrush and lasting about as long. Still, it\'s a small price to pay for that \'clean teeth\' feel, I think."

My teeth feel cleaner and it gets more of the tartar off of my teeth than the older electric toothbrush did. I find that my teeth feel cleaner all through the day. I don\'t feel any plaque build-up as I did before. Also, the toothbrush handle is longer and easier to hold onto. I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush."
2711,2782,20111104,B003UKKHB4,4,"November 4, 2011",A1VXIY1511XQK2,Oral B VS Sonicare flexcare,"I have owned the Sonicare Flexcare sonic electric toothbrushes the last 3 years and they break about once a year. After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up. Unfortunately i cannot tell you if they will last a long time since i just got mine about a week ago but i can tell you the difference between the two brands.The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you\'re not trying to, just when you\'re normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you\'re doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B\'s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i\'m brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B\'s. It\'s a bit annoying.The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy ine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They\'re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, but i\'ve yet to see how often they break. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They\'re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you\'re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain."

Having to go through all 3 settings to turn it on/off is annoying.  It\'s definitely not like the Sonic and doesn\'t tolerate much pressure at all - making it difficult in tight spots as it just stops if it thinks there is too much pressure being applied when it isn\'t always about the pressure.

Ok not really but it is a sweet little tooth brush. I love that it\'s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue you can put it on soft mode. The charger you see in the picture can actually come apart so you are left with a tiny stand if you want instead of the big face. The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist saying \'you\'re brushing your teeth too hard\' which can be very bad for you. Finally the cost. You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning. My mouth was a little sore but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \'I bet you haven\'t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\' I actually told him that wasn\'t true...I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing. My teeth feel the same as going to a dentist (plus I floss twice a day), every day..what more can you ask for.Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes... you get what you pay for period. People my age find this expensive, but the investment again is just a win-win that pays for itself right away. Did I mention is also really does help whiten teeth with the special head? yeah that\'s awesome also!...oh and the charge really does last all week"

There is one quirk that happens while using it that is a little annoying. It turns off and on radpidly about every 45 seconds. It happens so quickly that it doesn\'t disput brushing. Just annoying. It has a feature of three speeds which is very nice. when first turned on it is a regular speed, when the button is pressed again it goes to a slower speed designed for sensitive, when the button is pressed the third time it is a combination of regular and slow speed alternating radidly between the two.

My gums were bleeding and slightly tender.This is not a bad thing! Plainly put,the toothbrush delivered an efficient clean. My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.Since I keep the toothbrush in my bedroom (not enough outlets in the bathroom) I charge it only every other night.  It seems to hold the charge for the nights I forget to plug it in. Nice to know if I go on a business trip and leave the charger behind.While it gets into the crevices in my teeth, flossing should still be a separate step for getting in between the teeth."

It is an impressively sturdy unit, especially for the price.  It changes quickly, and holds its charge for a good long time.  The toothbrush head is larger than the one I had been using, but that is fine.  My dentist has always recommended a toothbrush like this, because you can work the gumline effectively in hard-to-reach places like the upper-back molars (which has historically been my brushing achillies heel.Anyhow, the only thing I don\'t like about this brush, and it\'s enough to make me consider using a different brush, is that they inserted these hard pieces of plastic in with the soft hairs, and it kind of rasps on your gums.  If you are using to using a medium or hard brush, this will probably feel quite good to you, but I\'m strictly a \'soft brush\' guy, so it is an unpleasant sensation.Still, this is a pretty impressive product for the money."

The small head makes it easy to get into tight spaces in the mouth (especially crowded teeth) and to focus on each tooth.  The timer is great for kids and keeps them brushing longer. I love that this brush is rechargeable - a real advantage over the cheapest power brushes, and the quality makes it a great alternative to more expensive ones.  Highly recommended!"

It seems to clean better, but it is pretty much \'on/off\' for controls.Details: The Oral-B Vitality is a very straightforward and simple unit. It does not have the power controls of the previous models, nor does it have the timer function that lets you know when it\'s time to move to another part of your mouth. Despite these differences, my wife says that it cleans better while using the same brushes as its predecessor. The motor is stronger than the previous one was when it was new. Her teeth feel cleaner using the same dentifrice. It\'s compact, including the charger. Overall, it\'s inexpensive and works well."

Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  The icing on the cake is the low price of this brush. Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  This is an excellent product. 4.5 Stars*** Positive Points: ***- Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)- Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3). The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).- It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base. You simply stick the raised portion of the charger into the end of the brush.- Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries- Brush vibrates to let you know when you have gone over the recommended 2 minute brush time.- 2 year warranty*** Negative Points: ***- Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.- There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.- The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouthOverall:  This toothbrush cannot be beat for its price.  I deducted half a star because there is no indicator light telling you the battery status, though this is a minor issue."

The Braun manufactured brush comes with the recharger base and 2 floss action brush heads for under $30 from Amazon which strikes me as, perhaps, the best bargain of all available powered brushes on the market because of the high quality and effective design.I\'ve been using the Sonicare system for roughly the last three years and I do love it, but the handle is bulky and the brush heads are expensive to replace.  I always have wondered if there was anything out there that was as good or better?  Enter this system...It actually seems to clean every bit as good, maybe better, and it makes my gums feel much more \'alive\' than the Sonicare does.  Judging by sink remnants it truly does clean at least as well, if not better.  I\'m guessing the floss action heads are truly small engineering marvels as they do seem to actually do what the name implies.  The size of the head suits me well after initially getting use to it.  That, combined with the more svelte handle allows me to easily get to the back of my teeth quite easily, better than the Sonicare IMHO.It is impossible to ignore that this system comes in noticably less in cost than the Sonicare too.  I\'ll still, on occassion, use the Sonicare, but this is my new favorite because it\'s effective cleaning and I really love the better stimulated feeling of my gums.  In fact, I will just say it:  I feel my teeth are cleaner and my gums much more invigorated with this winning product.  For me there are few downsides to this unit that I can think of.  Maybe the only thing I\'d like to have seen added was a brush guard, or holder, for sliding around the brush head when traveling...Otherwise, Oral B has hit a real \'homerun\' with this product which I feel works great, I enjoy immensely, and is a decent bargain too."

I used it for the recommended two minutes, and it left my teeth feeling and looking cleaner than when I use a regular toothbrush.It vibrates a lot, and the vibration in my hand felt fairly intense after two minutes. I\'m still not sure how the timer works, either. My only other complaint is that I wish there were a light or something to indicate that the toothbrush is charging. There\'s not.Although the package claims that the toothbrush cleans between teeth, you\'ll definitely still need to floss. I flossed after brushing, and I would say that there was less crud between my teeth than when I use a regular toothbrush, but there was still some (especially the back teeth; there was hardly any in my front teeth).I would definitely recommend this toothbrush, as long as you\'re OK with its intensity.

I am not the most dedicated of flossers but this electric toothbrush with it\'s Floss Action head does the trick.  The bristles are firm and get between the teeth to remove that heavy plague and gumlines.  I am not advocating this as s DEEP cleanser for that you probably need one of those electric at home Waterpik\'s, but this is the next best and cheapest alternative.While I am not big on rechargeable electric toothbrushes because I believe they are a bit passe, I won\'t discount this brush for being that, and matter of fact the rechargeable unit is not big and clunky as they use to be 10 years ago.  The package comes with two replaceable heads which according to instructions should be replaces every 3 months.  There is also a guide to selecting other replacement heads based on your needs, whether that be flossing, polishing, dual cleansing, precision, or for sensitive teeth.Good product, highly recommend."

Also since using it, and  using it almost exclusively during same 3-4 years, have had at least 50% less plaque/tartar deposits for my dentist\'s office to clean at my regular semi-annual check-ups--a fact much appreciated by same professionals and one that more than one dental hygienist has noted on countless patients who regularly use such brushes.  Oh, btw, when it comes time to replace the brush on these little jewels try to buy same replacement from your dentist office.

The floss heads are a little rough along the gums, sometimes causing a bit of bleeding if too much pressure and time is put to the gum areas. One simply has to be careful to not over-brush the gum line and all will be well with the rest of the mouth.The one star out of the five I took away for this review is because the brush has the problem with irritating gums, everything else is fine.The charging base is convenient, and the feel of the brush is solid.I recommend this product as a budget brush.

I examined every part of the toothbrush to see where it could have come from, and eventually rinsed out this tiny little hole towards the top of the toothbrush (which I had never noticed or thought about before) and found, to my horror, that it was absolutely filled with disgusting mold. You know those scenes in lowbrow comedies where a character finds out that they\'ve eaten something disgusting, and desperately try to clean out their mouth until they feel better? Yeah, the scene that followed was kind of like that.Maybe I missed something in the instructional booklet (and I DID read it,) but I had no idea I should be on the look-out for mold in such a random place in my toothbrush. A Google search has shown me that a lot of people have the same problem, and they fix it using things like bleach, hotel towels (\'Because it\'s too revolting to even use my own towels on it\') and an independently-created product that attempts to seal the stupid little hole.Personally, I\'m not going to use a hygiene product that can cause way more harm than good. I\'m going to give Oral-B the benefit of the doubt by being open to the idea that MAYBE this problem is avoidable with most electric toothbrush designs, but I still think it\'s really irresponsible to not at least include a note in the packaging that explains proper cleaning procedures."

There wasn\'t much info/reviews at the time, but what was out there was positive.  So I went back the next day and got it.  After using manual toothbrushes for our entire lives, my husband and I were very surprised how much cleaner our teeth felt.  Like I said, we have never used an electric one before, so this is not a comparison of other electric toothbrushes.  My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual so it\'s not that important to me.  I am still amazed at the length of the charge, we can go a week with two people using it twice daily.  The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  I have found some info about defective and/or counterfit heads.

Other Oral B units at many times this cost do NOT brush better, they just have features and I don\'t believe are necessary.  Downgraded one star because they, inexplicably (something about environment) tell you to unplug it after charging until it runs out of juice (2-3 days or so).

The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I\'d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a \'recognized name\' in oral hygiene (for whatever that\'s worth), and it\'s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).Since I don\'t have firsthand experience with other moto-brushes, I can\'t write a comparative review, but I CAN comment on this product\'s effectiveness in comparison with regular brushes, and that comparison is altogether favorable. Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before. This model features a two-minute timer, which is helpful. It\'s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well (I use it twice a day, and only need to charge it about once every eight days).Oral-b manufactures a variety of different heads for the Vitality line, and though I\'ve not tested the different varieties to see if they have markedly different results, I like the fact that the product is so well-supported; it means I probably won\'t soon find myself owning an obsolete brush for which I can\'t get replacement heads. The heads are sturdy, too, lasting me about three weeks or a month each.Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn\'t do things I don\'t need it to, doesn\'t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support.

It took some getting used to but after I did I felt it was doing a good job. I recently tried the Oral-b Dual Clean and found it to be a very old school design.  The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  If I only had the choice between this and a manual toothbrush I would choose the manual brush.  I\'m sure it does an okay job and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  I also suggest considering sonic brushes that do not have rotating parts, I think after you get used to them they leave your mouth feeling cleaner."

I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.While I have no complaints about its power, the fact that it utilizes two cleaning brushes gives it a much larger brushing surface than with the single brush found on my Soniccare.  While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist."

Because of this I\'ve used the old fashioned manual brushes that did a reasonable job of keeping my teeth clean. Well, this tradition is about to change.After using this brush, my teeth have a smooth and polished feel all the way down to just below the gum line! Amazing! Even my manual brushes don\'t do as thorough a job. Also, the brush charges through induction which means that it\'s waterproof and has no wires or metal contact points that need to be protected from water. This is very cool.I could only find one minor downside to this brush which is that the head is somewhat thick. What I mean is that the distance between the bristle tips and back of the head makes it necessary for me to open my mouth fairly wide  to get the brush the tops of my rear molars. This isn\'t a challenge for me but it might be for someone with a smaller mouth.I guess I can summarize my review by saying that I\'m tossing out my manual brushes because this is now my personal favorite.

But by keeping the brush on its stand with the charging cord plugged in I should have maximum power for each brushing.  The instructions that come with the brush say you can leave it plugged in, but recommend that every 6 months you let the battery deplete itself.Like another reviewer, I have sensitive teeth and prefer a soft brush.  The brush head that came with the brush seemed to work just fine for me.  The test will be when I have my next visit to the dentist and learn whether there has been an increase in gum erosion since the last visit.  However, just based on short time use, I have no reason to think there will be a problem.  My brushing includes running the brush over my tongue and the bristles feel no different than my other brushThe brush heads that I used on the previous brush don\'t work on this, but the literature that comes with the brush describes 5 different heads that do.  Quite an interesting variety, including floss action, precision clean, white+clean, and sensitive clean.As is true of most electric toothbrushes, heads are pricey if purchased from a local stored.  Amazon sells them at a heavily discounted price, so it is a good place to buy head replacements.  What I do and recommend that others do is to buy a supply of brushes at a time in order to get the best price and insure you have enough on hand to replace a head every 3 months if used twice a day.  The per head price is cheaper if you buy a pack of 6 heads than if you buy the standard 3 pack.  Amazon has both."

What I found is that the Vitality has a lot more power -- judged by the vibrations in my head -- plus it\'s even lighter weight, has replaceable heads, and a timer.Lighter weight is good, as are the replaceable heads because that means the whole family can use one base, and you can replace the toothbrush-head after flu or colds.More power should mean that it cleans better.  What I found is that my mouth felt \'cleaner\'... BUT, after I let my teeth \'go\' and get rather \'grotty\' for test reasons, the Vitality didn\'t seem to clean any better in those hard to reach between teeth spots, than it\'s cheaper cousin.  To be honest, I\'m not sure what to make of this observation.  I tried the cheaper cousin after that, plus a standard toothbrush, and nothing worked except floss -- thank heaven -- so perhaps my expectations are too high and no brush would accomplish this task.THE SKINNY:::We will be switching to this Oral B toothbrush and the reason is that I think it\'s more cost effective for us than cheaper Oral B battery operated models that we are currently using.  Though more expensive initially, you can purchase replacement heads so the whole family can use one base.I like the timer.  I thought only the kids would benefit, but to my surprise I wasn\'t brushing long enough either.It doesn\'t remove plague like claimed, but it definitely has more power than our comparison Oral B\'s, and made my mouth feel cleaner.I liked that the brushes were NOT rock hard.

I\'m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  When you have teeth that are not straight like I do the back sides of your teeth are very hard to reach and the smaller round head on the brush I find reaches the hard to get areas better than the longer rectangular brushes.  Doesn\'t straighten your teeth though.  Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I\'m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  I tend to think that is glamor over substance.  After all the brush is just rotating in an oscillating motion purre and simple.  It works and works well.  My model hesistates at the end of two minutes and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  You still need to floss and thats expected.  I have been very pleased with my last unit.  I didn\'t save the box and the model number isn\'t on it so I cant say which one it is.  I\'ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  Good product and will continue to use till new technology comes up with something better.

I got it about a year ago from my dentist\'s office, and absolutely love it.  The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...the savings is very significant!).I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn\'t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it\'s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren\'t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don\'t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)"

While I have been blessed with a cavity free mouth, I still hate enduring the scrape of the dentist\'s tools against my teeth. And I know it\'s just a matter of time until the dentist breaks out his drill...It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  You can probably chalk it up to \'user error\'....  I wasn\'t brushing properly, nor long enough to really keep a clean mouth.I did a bunch of research on electric toothbrushes to see what the fuss was about. Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  hmmm...  more research led me to this model - the motorized head rotates in the recommended pattern and the handle buzzes/vibrates in 30 or 45 second intervals to help you judge the brushing time of each section of your mouth.  Recommended time is 30 seconds per quadrant.  But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn\'t enough for me.  What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up) the amount of time you have been brushing.  If you look at the picture of the box, you can see the digital display, it\'s a little bit bigger than a business card, and about an inch thick.  As you are brushing, the display will track the quadrant you are brushing, and when your brush handle buzzes, the digital display will move to the next quadrant - giving you a visual que to move on to the next section of your mouth. It will even tell you if you\'re brushing too hard! When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds... the smiley face will wink at you!  :  It\'s a flirty toothbrush!My husband and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  We absolutely love them.  We recieved them two days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.  I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn\'t a big deal. I never have to wonder if I\'m brushing properly or if I\'m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \'fresh from the dentist\' clean mouth.  The handle holds its\' charge for a long time, I can brush for 2 1/2 minutes twice a day, for 9 days before having to recharge - however, I usually keep the brush handle in the charger when it\'s not in use.I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  The travel case is a hard, sturdy plastic to protect the brush handle, and the detachable brush.  It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly. My toothbrush will never again travel in a ziploc baggie.  :) Yay!I did have a little bit of sticker shock when I purchased two of these at the same time, and then again when I saw the cost of replacement brush heads.  But I feel like I am taking good care of my teeth, and I know my next dentist appointment will be less stressful.  Also - I know P&G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time. This makes me feel like I\'ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  Plus P&G offers coupons on their website all the time, so I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.This model isn\'t just an electric toothbrush - It\'s quality control for your mouth!  I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  Happy Brushing."

I read all the reviews and decided to go with this one.  I noticed a difference in just three days.  At first I experienced slight bleeding of my mug but it stopped after the first day.My teeth are shiner and it feels clean.  I am going to buy another one for my other half who is reluctant to go \'Electric\' :)
