3,3,20111101,B00006ANDJ,1,"November 1, 2011",A22BHQZVYQ6WF,faulty,Bought the replacement heads as the price was great compared to retail.  Big mistake.  The brushes pinched the insides of my cheeks and lips.  Painful and downright horrible.  Thought the first head was faulty and tried the next.  It did the same - threw them away.  Should have asked for a refund.

The brushes I purchased and used just simply don\'t work as well as the originals.  The bristles seem much softer and not as effective.  On the package of four that I received it did say \'Flexsoft EB-17-4\'.  Perhaps these are a different style and softer bristle.  In any event be aware of the style that is being sold and know that the original type was a more firm bristle, and more effective."

I even called and talked to a customer service rep.  He said he would look into it and back to me.  Never heard back from Amazon rep.But if you have an Oral-B it\'s pretty much your only option."

47,48,20051207,B00006ANDJ,3,"December 7, 2005",A198CCH4NNLI2E,Bristles seems engineered to fail quickly,"Remember when you didn\'t need to replace your toothbrush every 12 weeks? It\'s almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money. While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year."

Recently I bought the oral-b brush replacement 3pack and began adding it to my evening teeth cleaning.  After a few weeks I noticed tenderness in some of my gums.  I began brushing as usual, omitting the oral b, and the pain subsided.  I think maybe I was pressing too hard, as if I were brushing with a manual toothbrush.  I like the feeling of the oral b cleaning, but, as in all oral care, be careful not to brush too hard or you\'ll do damage to get that amazing clean feeling!"

When I\'ve had to use on because I ran out of replacement heads, I didn\'t feel like I\'d really brushed my teeth.  The electric toothbrush gets your mouth clean."

So with the pricey shipping in handling I saved 50 cents. Been awhile since I fell for that one; I\'ve just hated how much these stupid refills cost. they should cost a few bucks.It\'s a convenient way to buy these things, if you don\'t get out much, I guess. Not a huge savings though."

If you find them listed for about $5 per brush head, that\'s a good bargain (I\'ve seen 1-2 sold for $18).Note that the standard adult Flexisoft EB17 has dual colors, while the Extrasoft heads are all blue. Ensure that the description states \'extra-soft\' and the illustration is the all-blue bristle head."

Far inferior to standard brush head,"Purchased direct from Amazon - brushes appeared genuine Oral B, right down to the high price (nearly double what they were 2 years ago!).  Appropriate markings and all that.I have used all the brush head types, and thought that \'sensitive\' meant these would be gentle but still effective.  Switched to this brush head for a couple weeks.  When hubby asked for whitening toothpaste, I noticed that we were both experiencing staining, something that hasn\'t happened since we\'ve owned a power brush.  Thanks to lots of coffee and tea, I can *see* ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health.  Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth are back to normal now.I would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).  If you must use this brush, I would consider switching to the 45-second/quadrant program."

I have seen many fakes before where spelling and punctuation on the packaging is wrong.  I have used these fake heads before bought off of Ebay and they do fall apart in your mouth presenting a potential choking problem especially for kids.

Beware the \'generic\' replacement heads which look alike, but are usually priced lower and offer more heads for a given price. At least in my experience, the \'generics\' rotating brush head will loosen and sometimes come off completely in less than a week, AND can painfully trap part of ones cheek in the gap between the rotating and non-rotating parts!"

She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself. I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode."

I used to buy this type, because this was the only choice that I could find in the retail stores. Usually, \'Dual Clean\' heads also were available, but I do not like them. They are just so big. I wanted to switch to another type, and I did a little research. I found Oral-B \'Sensitive\' heads, and I found good reviews on this product. I am using this heads for a few weeks now. I bought this product because it probably has the highest bristle density, and the bristles are extra soft so they are very gentle on the gum. In my opinion, they do a very good job. I feel that they clean better than \'Precision Clean\' heads. I use HydroFloss after brushing. When I was using \'Precision Clean,\' I used to still see some stuff coming out of the area between my teeth during cleaning with HydroFloss. However, this stopped when I switched to \'Sensitive\' heads. I feel that \'Sensitive\' head is cleaning better. It is also more gentle on my gum."

I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head). Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me."

It is gentle on gums and teeth but does a very good job of cleaning and also controlling the formation of plaque.  This results in minimum \'medieval\' type of cleaning with a sharp tool or the use of ultrasonic cleaner that they just love to use just above the gum which results in less discomfort after a vist to the dental hygienist.

While the packaging looks OEM, the quality of these heads is vastly inferior to ones purchased off the shelf at Target/CVS/etc.  The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  I\'ve used Oral-B electric brushes for over 10 years, and these heads behaved very differently.  After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!) during operation.  Also, I noticed that the \'blue indicator bristles\' never changed color at all after 8-12 weeks of use.  I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  I have noted other reviews echo these same problems.My opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...I am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product."

They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That\'s a real laugh.  Even brushing just once a day, you\'re lucky if you get a month out of them.

The next size head down is a 40.The texture is SOFT, not Medium texture, and you should optfor the SOFT, rather than the Medium; the SOFT (this one) isplently firm to do the job without mushing down and wastingyour time just going through the motions without connecting.Looking at the bristles head-on (staring at the tips of thetufts, with the plastic head in the rear), the arrangementof the tufts (the pattern) is an oval. Normally I personallydo not like such an arrangement, preferring instead a solidrectangle, so as to purchase more surface area with which toconnect to the teeth and gums. In the case of the CrossAction(manual) toothbrush\'s configuration, the lack of \'corners\' tothe brush is not noticeable, unlike other oval-shaped heads.Reason for this is two-fold (am not a tech, this is personalconjecture or observation): the outer \'rim\' or border of thebrush\'s bristles is resilient (doesn\'t give easily, no mush),AND the very tip of the brush head has a special arrangementof slightly LONGER bristles (color: solid white, no bluishindicator layer) that reach v-e-r-y effectively into netherregions of the mouth (back molars?) to route out the bugs &leftover food particles. All you need is SOFT, not Medium;should you utilize a Medium (texture rating, not size) one,you\'d gouge your gums and whatever else is in there. You\'llget enough traction and friction and devil-exorcising actionwith a SOFT CrossAction (manual) toothbrush.Do not confuse the CrossAction with the Advantage series ofOral-B manual toothbrushes; although the Advantage line hasa similar appearance (shape and combination of features), Iventure to tout the CrossAction as being superior in termsof achieving results (getting one\'s teeth and gumline cleanin the least amount of time, with the minimum of dexterity).In case you DO wish to order a single Advantage toothbrushin the same order (to compare the two brushes), go to theSearch box and either type or copy/paste the Amazon ID# forthat style, which is ASIN: B0000C4KJG. Type B0000C4KJG w/othe \'ASIN:\'. That\'ll get you to the page which concerns theSKU 086736 (full head, soft). At the time of this review ittakes two cents more to total 25 bucks, to avoid shipping.The UPC/NDC (666 barcode) number is 3-00410-60639-8 for theCrossAction 60 Soft; that\'s for ONE brush. Six-pack sleeveshave a similar but different number, but you don\'t need thatto double-check the #53 CrossAction in a retail store. Whenyou wish to hunt down our brush in the haphazardly sortedretailer\'s toothbrush rack, home in on the reddish number53, located at the extreme tip of the J-hook tab at the TOPof the individual blister package. This\'ll save you gettingfrustrated or confused when rummaging through the toothbrushrack in search of WORDS. Find Oral-B and then find the 53...Amazon saves you money (per individual toothbrush) comparedto what the stores charge (about 4 smackers each), but youcan get your mitts on a sample in a retail Rx before you doorder (in case you prefer to SEE and heft what you\'ll getas a six-count from Amazon).The two downsides are- the blister packaging is not really biodegradable (tough);- the parent company is B-I-G on animal testing (laboratoryexperiments, usually redundant, on sentient rabbit eyes...).The Oral-B CrossAction style of manual toothbrush, althoughmore expensive than shlock-brand models, is well worth themonetary outlay. The squeaky-clean satifaction will SPOILyou, and you won\'t settle for a manual toothbrush of lesserquality in the future.This brush does not include the rubber bristles along theouter edge of similar toothbrushes: they are supposed tomassage your gums, but IMHO the regular CrossAction doesenough work on both the teeth and also the gumline to actas a do-it-all toothbrush (no, it does not floss!).BTW, your dentist probably never has mentioned during allthe precious moments that you have spent together THAT THEGUMS ACT AS AN O-RING GASKET SEAL between your teeth andthe jaw-bones. Maintaining the gums (such as with a brush)preserves the GUMS, which in turn will protect your teethROOTS and jawBONES from bacteria and foreign matter. Youneglect your gums when in your prime, and you\'ll reap amess of AVOIDABLE trouble with your roots and bones later.Perhaps you might even suggest to your dentist that s/hebe more proactive in making patients AWARE of the role ofthe (silent) g-u-m-s in protecting the base of out teeth!Parting comment: sugar rots teeth, but the bone particleswithIN refined sugar are the #1 cause of various cancers.This according to avatar Sathya Sai Baba, who should know."

423,431,20050817,B0000C4KJV,4,"August 17, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one\'s teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.2.  Waxed floss is \'waxed\' to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don\'t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: \'If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away\'.I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.Jim \'Konedog\' Koenig, DDS"

I do think they make a small yet noticeable difference on my teeth , I found them to be VERY hard on my gums (even though I don\'t normally have sensitive teeth/gums).I will use these occasionally (until the 3-pack I bought is used up), but these are not my regular toothbrush heads.  I like others much more, and could live without these no problem.So, all in all, these were OK but I will not repurchase.  A toothbrush needs to be practical for your whole mouth.

The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision. The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure. Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums. I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.

I\'ve used this product for several years and intend to continue with it forever.  Nothing beats this particular brush head.  The dental hygienists are always pleased with the excellent condition of my teeth and gums. I thank the Oral-B Dual Clean Brush Heads for that.

The Dual Action / Dual Clean is another matter. It started out working alright, although like many others I found the brush head to be a bit too large. One day while brushing, the brush severely pinched my tongue causing it to bleed. Upon close inspection, the lower oblong brush seemed loose with a substantial gap between it and the brush housing. I suspect that over time friction wears away at the internal parts leading to looseness.I was not happy about the experience and sent the defective brush to Procter & Gamble for evaluation. I was quite surprised when they replied that no manufacturing defect was present, despite being informed of the loose lower brush. They could provide no explanation as to how the injury occurred and would not provide any contact information for me to escalate the issue. If this is P&G\'s attitude towards product safety, I will avoid purchasing any of their products in the future."

I can feel it all the way to the base of each tooth.  When I rinse, I see more loosened debris swirling down the drain.  I finish my morning brushing with a hydrogen peroxide rinse, and, man oh man, does it get foamy, an indication of freshly cleaned dental and gum surfaces.The price is already a bargain but with additional available discounts like Free Super Saver Shipping, it\'s a steal."

I had to develop an arm movement that would first put one of the heads against my teeth and then pivot the angle of my hand into my mouth to get the second head into contact with the same teeth.The head closest to the hand can NOT be used on the back molars, at least not in my mouth.It is a great idea, but needs to have the lower head (closest to the hand) kind of float."

At first I was afraid to open the packaging because of all those reports about brush heads having no repacement ring, having an oral-B insignia with a grey background, and made in Germany are counterfiet. But, eventually I opened the package, and nothing is wrong with the brush head. It is Not a Tongue Mutilator, nor does it have out of shape bristels, not is it a counterfeit. All those pieces of information are either false, or just one time bad experiences. My brush head still has its shape maintained, isn\'t too hard and hasn\'t done anything funky. I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time and I just like it. If someone has a smaller than average mouth then, or if you\'re one of those people who was used to small brush heads back in the day (when you used conventional brushes), then this brush head is not for you. Otherwise its a wonderful brush head and it definitely beats the precission brush head by far (I haven\'t used the floss action brush head yet so I dont know if that one is any better)."

These are not the upgraded motorized heads. They are just a regular brush that fits onto the motorized section.  The price for these has never come down and there is nothing to warrant other than no one else provides a generic fit.  The latest technology applies rotating heads and these are not compatable.  So while the device itself provides good oral care you are forced to overpay dramatically for refills.

I thought \'oral-B\' meant it would fit my brush, and that \'sonic\' referred to the type of head.  I did not see anything that said \'this brush head only fits the sonic style oral-b\'  and because all the models I have ever had and the models my friends and family have take the same brush heads. Whenever I buy Oral B heads in a store they fit my toothbrush.  Therefore, I will describe this site and/or this brush \'not user friendly\'. If not all your heads fit all the models, you should make it clear.  This was a big waste of time and money for me so other consumers be forewarned.

My previous brushes (I have had a lot of them since I owned the toothbrush for many years) never had this problem, even if I used them beyond the recommended 3 months which Oral B recommends.I am now going to contact Direct Super Center and Amazon about this issue, but I have a feeling that Direct Super Center won\'t help, after reading other comments posted here.I love this toothbrush and have had comments by my dentist about just how immaculate my teeth remain, so I will definitely be purchasing more brush heads.

So its intended circular motion no longer worked well.  So i though maybe it was just a bad one.  I got out the next one, and 2 weeks latter. Same thing happened.  So i compared it to a genuine one from walmart, and noticed some differences.  It was missing a serial number through the little window on the back, and the plastic piece up in the inside was different as well. Also pivoting piece attached to the head (This is what comes loose and causes the head to move erratic) on the inside that you can see through those three small windows. Looks less substantial.

Ignore the \'floss\' part - that\'s just marketing hype and you better still use a real dental floss. Yes, the Floss Action heads are a bit bigger, but I think that suits me fine, and you\'ll probably be down with it too unless you\'ve got really small teeth.I think this is the question you should ask yourself: Do you usually prefer soft/medium bristle toothbrushes, or do you tend to seek out the firms? I\'m a firm guy, thus I prefer the Floss Action heads. The yellow rubber bits gives these heads a hardness that I love and I feel like it cleans my teeth better.

The first thing that I noticed is that the blue color is darker.  Then the coefficient of friction moving from one tooth to the next tooth is much higher.  Probably what happened is that the fake brush has cut bristles and the real thing has rounded bristles.  Finally, the most obvious tell is that you can easily scratch the logo off the counterfeit item with your fingernail but the real item has a completely glazed surface.I have been buying these Floss Action brushes for about 3 years (since they first came out) and I replace them every month, so I\'ve bought a lot of them.

The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth.  The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design.  It was worth trying and I\'m not disappointed but will probably be going back to the easier to maneuver regular version next time.

The fakes are also getting very hard to spot apparently, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct. You use it in a very sensitive area of your body, and it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off is similar in quality."

It was only when I sought out a remedy and came across studies linking SLS -- sodium lauryl sulfate -- as a major contributor to canker sore outbreaks that I discovered this amazing toothpaste. I have used this toothpaste since it came out on the market and my incidence of outbreaks has diminished nearly 100%. If I do happen to get an outbreak, which will happen if I do not brush at least three times per day, the intensity of the outbreak is significantly reduced and the amount of time the canker sore lasts is only a few days.

I also like that it is much less bulky and feels more natural in my hand. I went into my dentist four months (and zero uses of dental floss) after starting with the Pulsonic and she said \'finally, you\'re actually using dental floss! I\'m so proud of you\'. I didn\'t want to break her heart, so I just nodded and smiled.My only problem with the refills is the stupid pick thing that you have to buy along with the three heads, and thus the three star review.

I have to remember to let it run down completely some time in the next few months as the instructions suggest.  I\'m ready to buy a second one for my husband.

But the battery is a Ni-MH battery, not Li battery.

It\'s also relatively portable, so good for travel too, though you\'ll need to bring the charger along for longer trips.The Pulsonic is not as gentle on your teeth and gums as most of the more expensive toothbrushes I\'ve owned, but I haven\'t had any problems with it. It just feels like the motor does not run quite as fast or as smoothly and I think that probably makes it a little less effective at getting your teeth completely clean. It is certainly a lot better than my old manual toothbrush though! Overall I think it works very well.I bought it about a month after my previous (2-3X the price) electric brush broke, so I\'d been using a manual brush for a bit. After a week of using the Pulsonic my teeth were noticeably whiter and have gotten whiter since then. I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past- my soda drinking youth eventually caught up with me I guess:(. I\'ve had this brush for a year and my dentist says my teeth and gums are in great shape.My only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn\'t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right? If you\'re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don\'t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic."

It operates, it buzzes, it looks and feels a bit like the Sonicare, but compared to the Sonicare it has no cleaning power.  A good sonic toothbrush can go a long way to keeping teeth white, clean and can reduce the number of trips to the dentist, but I don\'t think this one is the answer."

The pulsonic has two settings - regular and sensitive which should do the job for most people. The unit is slim, well designed, and light weight which is important to me.  The last thing I need is a toothbrush that looks and weighs like a lead pipe.As for performance, the pulsonic does a great job of cleaning teeth. The sensitive mode is great if you don\'t want the feeling of a Jack hammer inside your mouth.  As long as you take your time to brush  and utilize the recommended brushing technique (round, circular motion), you\'re going to find this product does a superb job. It also helps whiten teeth as well.Highly recommended if you\'re looking for a simple, high quality electric toothbrush at a reasonable price."

Good, but a little clumsy and heavy. When the battery died I bought the Oral B Sonic Complete. With its battery now almost dead, I replaced it with the Pulsonic, which I thought was an advance in design. Unfortunately, the brush is too firm for comfort, so I am using it at low speed. I really prefer the Sonic Complete, which has a comfortable soft brush, so I regret the decision to buy the Pulsonic. Three stars only--it\'s OK, not good."

The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.  I bought this second one in 9/2010 while Amazon & OralB had a 50% off rebate so ended up paying only $25 for it - a definite buy at that price!  Don\'t think I would pay over $40 given the restrictive charging base."

Yes, it has two settings but, it shouldn\'t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn\'t have to with their older model. The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting. There is also no indication that it is fully charged except by plugging it in when uncharged and timing it.  The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  I\'m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  I am now \'cost sensitive\' as I am only willing to spend so much to \'rent\' a unit for a couple of years (my older one lasted on the lower side of this equation) only to have to throw it and the useless, spare, brand new brushes I have away (it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit\'s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.On the plus side, it is very slim so it fits nicely in the hand and, I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once so, I suppose that jackhammer feeling of the brush obviously did not do any harm to the enamel as I had feared it would."

This new Oral B Pulsonic seems to address two problems very well; ticklish gums and the second small pick like brush.  The lower \'sensitive\' speed does not tickle the gums, and the pick like brush allows me to carefully brush the gum line and the crevices between teeth.

The Oral-B Pulsonic was my first venture into the higher end toothbrushes and I must say it is very nice.  Let me first say I am not big on reading directions on most products before I try them out.  So, after a few days of brushing, I went to the directions to see why my new toothbrush kept pausing or hesitating after a couple minutes of brushing.  Low and behold, it\'s a feature designed to let you know it\'s time to move on to another part of your mouth...very nice.The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.  The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  I have found the button placement may not be located at the best spot for some people.  While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  The brush is thinner than other brushes I have used.  I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  Also, the brush head is much smaller with fewer frills than other sonic brushes I have tried.Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.  I cannot say if this toothbrush out pulses the competition or does a better job of cleaning, but compared to the previous brushes I have tried this one is twice the price.

At first I didn\'t like the size (read: I wasn\'t used to it), but after brushing with it for a weeks, I realize that I like it better because I can be more precise with my brushing (like with a regular toothbrush)The charger has a small footprint, so it doesn\'t take up too much counter space. It is  also understated so it doesn\'t draw attention to itself.Cons:The attachments (brush, floss brush) can come off or loosen during brushing. If you brush in a wrist-twisting motion like me, you\'ll have to change your brushing style or the tops will keep coming off.It only comes with one brush head. This means that unless you\'re a bachelor, you\'ll need to buy additional heads. I haven\'t looked up the price to these, but that\'s definitely something to consider.There is no cover for the brush heads. This can\'t be too sanitary - especially in a bathroom (dust, hairspray, hand-washing splashes, toilet mist, etc)Final opinion:While I do think this could be a good-value alternative to the costlier sonic toothbrush models, ultimately it\'s hard to say if this unit cleans much better than a manual toothbrush. I still end up brushing my teeth like I did with a regular toothbrush  - the only difference being that this one is vibrating as I go.With questionable benefits and so many shortcomings, I cannot recomend this product."

It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can\'t say that they appear whiter.  I find that the 30 second timer and two minute marker to be both helpful yet a bit annoying- its nice to know how long you\'ve been working on a section of teeth but I tend to brush longer than the recommended 2 minutes so it isn\'t broken up to my needs.Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  The Pulsonic seems a bit flimsy- like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  I also don\'t feel like the bristles get in between my teeth like the Sonicare did, either.  The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn\'t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.  I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!"

1564,1602,20090104,B001CX4JSS,3,"January 4, 2009",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,"Mediocre, but one redeeming feature","This is a rather mediocre electric brush compared with other Oral-B products (such as the Triumph, which is excellent) or any of the Sonicare line of brushes. Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use. Why the three stars and not just one? It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip brush.I have both a Oral-B Triumph and a Sonicare (can\'t remember the model number), and find both to be excellent performers. They are different, and each has its strengths/weaknesses, so I alternate between the two. The one shortcoming neither address well is getting between teeth to get out tea and coffee stains (and the occasional cigarette). For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside. My 6-month dental cleaning/checkup gets rid of them, but by month 4 or 5, they\'re back.Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it\'s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains. The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great. After brushing with either the Triumph or Sonicare, I finish with a 30-60 second run using the Precision Tip. Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth using.For everything else, the Pulsonic is a so-so performer at best. Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I\'ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.If you\'re looking to stop or get rid of in-between teeth stains, get this model and use it in combination with another model. If in-between teeth stains are not an issue, don\'t even bother with this. Pick up a different Oral-B or a Sonicare -- you\'ll be a lot happier with it than the Pulsonic."

When I brush with an electric toothbrush, I want to be able to slowly move my toothbrush around while the cleaning power of the toothbrush head does all the work and leaves my mouth feeling dentist clean.  That is not the experience I have had with the pulsonic.  Although the brush head vibrates significantly and loosens plaque, I find I\'m having to perform the laborious back-and-forth to the extent that I do with a manual brush.  Electric brushing is supposed to be fun and easy!  Oscillation is key, and this brush doesn\'t have it."

It was time to replace it because it wasn\'t holding a charge for very long. I decided to try this cheaper version and I am not sorry. It does the same job as the more expensive version and is easier to hold. It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it. Because it is lighter and thinner, I think I actually use it longer. It is also easier to find the replacement heads for it. I also think that the shape of the toothbrush makes it is easier to get at the back of the bottom teeth where the plaque is the worst. That means less time in the hygenist chair. Since using the sonic toothbrush I definitely see a decrease in the build up of plaque and that is makes this purchase worth every cent."

It is light enough and simple enough for her to use without our help.I would have given it 5 stars if the tips were compatible with other Oral-B brushes (Triumph series).

I\'ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them. They were loud, heavy and large in the hand. I was hesitant to try a power toothbrush again, but my dentist suggested it was time to cave and get another. So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush. It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud. I especially like the additional small brush head that comes with it. The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth. The small size of the brush is also great for travel. For short trips I just pack the toothbrush with a regular brushhead cover. For longer trips, I throw in the base and the brush. The base is not too large, so it is not a huge annoyance to pack. My one complaint (and thus the 4 stars) would be that it does not come with a travel case. Seems kind of odd since its size makes it a great travel power toothbrush."

It\'s an electric toothbrush that\'s about the same size a conventional toothbrush!And it does a good job of cleaning my teeth. I\'ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I\'m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance. It\'s a mighty little toothbrush.The one and only drawback I\'ve found -- and it\'s a small one --  is that unlike the Sonicare the Pulsonic doesn\'t have a 2 minute timer. Instead it has a 30 second timer.  You have to count to four without electronic assistance (Four 30-sec treatments equal 2 minutes which is my Dentist\'s recommended brushing time.)Also as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars. Most toothbrushes -- both electric and non-electric -- fail this test. So that\'s another big plus.So in a nutshell, if you\'re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel), small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all."

While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.ADVANTAGES:Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It\'s not the most powerful brush I\'ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.DISADVANTAGES:Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it\'s nice to have the option and this one does not.Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it\'s power would rate 3 stars.OTHER COMMENTS:Does it whiten teeth?  It\'s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.  I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me."

What a disappointment!  Shoddy construction -- the brush part twists off so easily that it came off twice while I was using it, and it vibrates your hand more than in your mouth.  It also lacks a brush cover, something I was used to with the Sonicare.

It is also nice and small. It comes with one regular brush head and a precision tip brush head. The precision tip works really nice to clean in between teeth especially the hard to reach back teeth. It has a clean and sensitive speed. I can\'t really tell the difference between the two but if you have sensitive teeth I am pretty sure you will. It also comes with a charging stand. It is small and holds to brush heads. It has a small profile so it wont take up a lot of counter space. It also has a mount where you can screw two nails on the wall and mount the stand on the wall. The brush does a great job of cleaning my teeth. Especially between the teeth using the precision tip. The brush heads are very easy and fast to switch. It is simple to clean. Overall I like the brush. A travel case would have been a nice companion to this set.

I previously used the Hydrabrush, which is very bulky and heavy with large brushes and felt uncomfortable in my mouth.  This Oral-B Pulsonic feels very comfortable in my mouth; the brush head is very small.  There are two modes, clean and sensitive, which I really like.  At first the clean mode was too strong on my teeth and I switched to the sensitive mode.  Now I\'m used to the clean mode, but use the sensitive mode behind my teeth where it\'s more gentle on my gums. It also has a very small brush head for in between teeth; somewhat like flossing. It has 30-second timers (not a beep, a hesitation) to let you know when to switch to another section of teeth if you want to.  My teeth feel very clean and tartar free after brushing.  The only reason I\'m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are NO replacement brush heads; even though it recommends replacing them every three months.

This is one of the only ones that fits (the other one is a colgate, that I get as a sample from my dentist but haven\'t tried to buy it yet).The wax does come off, which is an irritant but not a deal breaker.The price is good (though it\'s slightly cheaper at my local Walmart and Target).I saw one reviewer had some issue with the floss receding into the dispenser. I have used at least 40/50 of these over the years. That has happened twice to me. But it\'s fairly easy to open it (you need to pry it open with something sharp enough) and get the floss out. Again, an irritant if and when it happens, but fairly rare event for me to not worry about it."

Once it goes in your mouth the floss breaks the moment it touches any teeth.  I\'m not sure how Oral B can put their name to this piece of junk. The worst part, the floss often tares apart in shreds (when it doesn\'t break entirely), leaving threads of this stuff stuck in between your teeth.  So, you have to use ANOTHER one to get the first one out. Often times you end up shredding that one in the same spot and need to try again using just enough pressure to make it between the teeth, but not too much that it leaves another thread stuck there.  Very frustrating.Plackers are the ONLY ones I\'ve ever used that simply DO NOT BREAK. Although the name is a bit disgusting, the product is amazing!  http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Micro-Mint-Flossers-Count/dp/B0013NFZQW/ref=sr_1_1?rps=1&ie=UTF8&qid=1332738296&sr=8-1"

I can keep them hand in my purse, buy the TV and in my home office.  I have NEVER had one break; they slide easily between my teeth as promised. I have lots of problems with some floss catching on my dental work or shredding between my tight teeth, but the OralB floss picks have a smooth ribbon floss that meets the challenge without any problems. The pick end works well too, it is thin enough to fit between teeth comfortable but strong enough to deal with larger pieces of caught food. The long lasting mint, doesn\'t last long but that really doesn\'t bother me. I would definitely recommend this product."

The 2 minute timer makes it easy to brush the proper amount of time and since I\'ve been using these my Dentist has complimented me on how well I maintain my teeth. I like this style because you can use regular AA batteries or rechargable AA batteries (which is what I use). The charge usually lasts more than a month.

I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I\'m lucky enough to have a window and sill.For that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don\'t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life. And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all. The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical. But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again. I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).In my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months. Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don\'t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B."

It has a steady rate for cleaning, fits well in the hand, holds a decent amount of toothpaste and, especially great for anyone with a small mouth, isn\'t too big.  I have no problem reaching my back teeth with the smaller head of this toothbrush or angling it around to ensure a good cleaning.

Owned several rechargeable (internal battery) types but seem to have very little luck with these -- the motor failed, or the thing would not hold the charge for any reasonable period of time, or the speed degraded after some time.This removable battery model, although made in China, seems to be better than the earlier ones that I had which were made in Germany and in Mexico. The speed seems to be much faster than the ones I owned earlier and the batteries seem to last a very long time, despite the fact that currently 2 persons are using the same unit. Three weeks on and I am still on the original batteries. I like the shape and the feel of these units, they are not cylindrical like the earlier ones I owned, and they are easier to grip.I am glad that these toothbrush are sold directly by Amazon. I ordered a couple about 3 years ago and these came from a third party associated with Amazon. The packing then was very poor and the items were almost falling out of the packs when I got them.The current 3 that I bought came intact and very well packed, true Amazon quality. Delivery was prompt.I shall be ordering more, just in case these are phased out and replaced by inferior \'updated versions\'."

These toothbrushes also feature  electronics that keep the motor voltage constant - and hence maintain optimal orbital brushing speed - even as the battery voltage declines as they discharge. So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops. So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries! This feature also means despite the lower voltage of using 2x 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, you get the same brushing speed and power as using 2x 1.5V Alkaline cells. This is great! as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.Build quality of the units is great as you\'d expect for a Braun, even for a cheaper unit. The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section. This guarantees moisture vapour can\'t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term service.The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can\'t get into the internals.The 2-minute timer is a nice feature. At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing but if you wan\'t to keep brushing, you can as it doesnt turn the motor off.Overall this brush is great, especially for the price. The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific. The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber. All these problems are remedied with this Braun model."

While it\'ll be another 6 months before I know if my gums have stopped receding, I\'m confident that this toothbrush has benefited my routine already. First, bc of the motion sensor and timer, I now realize that I have been brushing much longer and harder than I\'ve needed to for probably my entire life. Second, despite the fact that I\'m no longer scrubbing my teeth with all my strength (I actually use the lighter \'Sensitive\' setting with the sensitive brush heads), my teeth look and feel much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush, there\'s less noticeable plaque buildup, and I\'ve been able to maintain that just-cleaned-at-the-dentist feeling for over a month (as opposed to a few days before).

There are youtube videos that demonstrate hack jobs requiring the user to break the seals and remove solder points and circuit board components, but I don\'t consider that to be a user friendly service by any means. This is a serious design flaw that one might suspect as being intentional (a battery costs about twenty bucks, but Braun/Oral-B would probably rather sell a whole new system for over a hundred bucks). This also makes it difficult to recycle the battery apart from the rest of the plastic and electronics. This is not a green technology and it is obvious that Braun/Oral-B do not care about customers or the environment very much. I would avoid doing business with companies like this, which is a shame since they could offer what would otherwise be great products."

However, I really like the indicator unit that it comes with. The count-down timer is awesome and forces me to give my teeth enough time to do the proper brushing.

Its suppose to allow you to sync 2 brushes with it, but I had to use both slots to sync the same brush otherwise it just lose sync for some wierd reason.

The unit is an aggressive toothbrush and does a much better job in the 2 minutes it takes versus 3 minutes on the old one. The timer is cute but probably not essential. I like to take 2.5 minutes versus the 2 minutes it suggests.The brush head has a more varied profile and seems to get in places the old one didn\'t. The brush cycle is more aggressive and \'feels\' like it is doing a better job, although I am a little worried it might be too strong. You can reset it to a more gentle pattern and several different head styles are available.The only way I could get the Hard brushing alert to kick in was to push very hard.The travel case came in handy right away and it the tooth brush worked for a week on the road without a charge."

We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist\'s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn\'t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn\'t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don\'t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn\'t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth."

When it was fully charged, I tried again and can I just say WOW. That toothbrush packs a heavy punch. It\'s very high powered, which is just what I need to get all the daily grossness off my teeth.I bought the toothbrush during Oral-B\'s discount, but I would definitely buy the toothbrush without the discount. After trying this only once, I\'m already in love.The only complaint I have is with the time it took for the toothbrush to actually arrive at my house.

It came with the 5000 handle, wireless display, charger, 2 FlossAction brush heads and a storage unit for brush heads.I was using the same Oral-B FlossAction brushheads with the 3D Excel, and I think the real technology is in the brushheads, so I was skeptical of the value from the 5000 handle. But when I brushed with it this morning I was really surprised by how much better this handle is from the 3D Excel. I also realized why I have been using electric toothbrushes; manual toothbrushes do not even come close. It felt like I went to the dentist. Absolutely worth the $50 I paid (after mail in rebate) including shipping. I still think the wireless display (Smart Guide) is a marketing gimmick, but I may be proven wrong over the next several weeks of use.I have not used the 3000, 4000 series or the Sonicare, but I would definitely recommend this over the 3D Excel handle and definitely over manual toothbrushes."

My old one was getting long in the tooth(sorry about pun!) and running real slow, so I investigated buying a new one.  Since they were on a 50% rebate sale, i just bought the top of the line 5000 unit.  I could not be more pleased with how clean my teeth end up - I have never had a brush that cleans as well as this one; my hygienist will be so pleased!I would like to expound on the advantages of this unit over the 4000 or 3000 in cleaning ability, but I have no idea, not having used the others.  If the only difference is gimmicks, then this unit is certainly full of them, and you might be just as pleased with a cheaper unit without the unnecessary gimmicks and modes.One big con: there is a mode button to toggle through the 5 different modes that are built into this unit.  Most people, like me, will probably only use one mode, or at least will predominately use one mode.  The mode button is VERY poorly placed, in a very key position.  It is impossible to use this unit without accidentally hitting the mode key on a regular basis, if not every day.  Very annoying to have to figure out how to get back to your preferred mode.  They could not have chosen a poorer location for this if that was the goal.  Its like accidentally hitting the caps lock key on a laptop, for those who do not look at the screen while we type. What were they thinking, if they were thinking at all?  I like good design.  All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an \'F\' for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO. It was just too big a mistake to be an oversight. A smaller con - the outlet plug is a huge unit that sticks straight out from the wall - takes up space and looks stupid - should have been flush.Yet overall, I gave this 4 stars for the great cleaning and the rest of the design and charger."

However, this \'rebate\' is not cash back or a true rebate where the money is refunded to you; rather, it is in a form of a prepaid Visa which annoyed me greatly because instead of getting money back into your accounts, you are forced to spend money on a card that also has Account Maintenance Fees. I was livid as I discovered this this morning after speaking to the Oral B rebates rep who also apparently \'just learned\' about the rebate policy changes.

I have taken it on vacation, and have found that it will hold a charge for up to 5 days, so you may not have to hook up the recharge base for short trips.I highly reccommend this to any one wanting to invest in a rechargeable Toothbrush."

Even uses my extra brush heads from my old battery operated Oral-B toothbrush.  Does an excellent job of cleaning.  The clock/timer helps assure proper brushing of all areas.  I like the flexibility of the different settings although I have only used the regular setting for 2 minute brushing.  Holds a full charge for somewhere between 3 and 4 weeks (I normally brush once a day) so I can put the charging unit out of site between charges and put the hand held unit in a drawer saving on counter space.

It took me a little while to set up (it\'s pretty complicated for a toothbrush), but it was completely worth it. I don\'t think the battery life is too good, but I always charge it after I use it, so it\'s never a big deal. It makes my teeth feel really clean, and it\'s nice to know how long you\'ve been brushing and if you\'re brushing too hard. It\'s an expensive toothbrush, but it\'s excellent if you want to be more conscious about your brushing habits. Totally recommend!"

The clock counts how long you have been brushing, what brushing mode you are in, and if you are applying too much pressure. A cute smiley face appears when you hit your 2 minute dentist recommended brush time. It starts winking at you if you brush more, a little suggestive like you did the brush a favor.It comes with a nice carrying case for trips and it has a nice stand that can store extra brushes. I don\'t know what else I could ask for. It seems to brush better than the Sonicare I had lost so it made the transition sweet and easy.Bottom line, I will be more than upset were I to lose this toothbrush and would easily buy another one."

Has a handy timer/wall clock unit to tell you when you\'ve reached the two minute recommended brushing time, but I always exceed that since I like a good scrubbing on the choppers.No issues at all so far with the unit.  The real test will be when I return to my dentist (who had in fact recommended this unit) and see if the cleaning is shorter or if they notice any difference.I\'ll update after that happens.Overall, I\'m completely pleased and think that it\'s probably a good investment.  Also, and it may be my imagination, but I think my teeth are whiter now than they used to be.I would recommend this (and have) to my friends."

It takes a few days to get used to not using the same rigorous back and forth brushing action, but you get used to it. The secret is in the reciprocating action that allows the brush to get between teeth in ways a normal brush cannot. It also cleans those tough back molars extremely well. The included charger is also 110-220v which is a nice feature for someone who travels a lot and lives in Europe like myself. I was also a little apprehensive about the wireless timer/clock, but after using it for awhile it makes a lot of sense and I like using it. I wish they would include an alarm clock or multiple timezones in future iterations to make it more travel friendly and usable. If there were any downside to this toothbrush it would be in it\'s travel \'footprint\'. Although the case is very nice and holds the brush and two heads, its much larger than a regular brush and will take up more space while traveling. The additional wireless timer adds additional packing requirements (which is why I recommend that they add some more features to the clock to make it more usable and travel friendly). If you don\'t travel much, then the size will be fine for your bathroom and the included stand is nice, functional, and compact. Overall, I strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to bring their oral hygiene to the next level. It\'s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but I guarantee your teeth will feel considerably cleaner and look whiter after using it for only a week or two. Great product!"

Oral B has discontinued the Sonic line.  So, I tried the Professional Care/Smart Series - what an improvement!  I like it much better than the Sonic Complete.  It brushes much more thoroughly.On the downside, it is a bit louder (not a big deal) and the RPM drops noticeably as the days go by until I recharge it.  (I don\'t leave it in the charger after every use, only when the battery is almost dead).I went with the 5000 over the lower models because the price was insignificantly higher at the time.  I will admit that I don\'t use the advanced features that the 5000 has over the lower models.  The massaging and other brushing modes don\'t impress me; I just use the regular mode.  (I used to use the soft mode on the Sonic Complete, but I don\'t have a problem with the aggressiveness of the regular mode in the 5000).  The clock/brushing timer is interesting for the first couple of weeks, but now I totally ignore it.  Kind of nice to have a clock in the bathroom when you are getting ready for work, that\'s the only benefit.  The quality of the toothbrush and the clock unit is very impressive.I use the soft headed brushes.I have been using the toothbrush for six months now.  Dentist report was \'all ok\'."

It is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I\'ve owned, and my last one lasted 13 years. When it started to loose its charge while I was brushing my teeth I looked at what was available and decided on the 5000.I like that it has a space to store 4 brush heads, so I won\'t have to search for where I placed the extra ones when its time to change it. Also, the contour of the handle is very nice.On one of the reviews I read before I bought it, someone was unhappy with the timer. It\'s a nice, waterproof digital clock and you do not have to sync it up with the toothbrush if you don\'t want to. I did so I could tell when I\'m applying too much pressure. If you do use the timer, at 2 minutes you get a smiley face, and at 2 1/2 minutes it winks at you.The one thing I don\'t really like is that every 30 seconds it pulses to let you know to move to the next area of your mouth, but I do not brush my teeth in sections like they want you to. I asked my Dental Hygienist, who also uses one, and she doesn\'t do it their way either.She also recommended that I leave the handle off the charger until the charge wears down. The toothbrush has a \'Smart\' battery and she has heard of people having problems with the battery not holding a charge if it is keep constantly charging. The handle shows how much charge the battery has so I only charge it once a week or so.The travel case that comes with it is another nice feature. Since it holds a charge well, you can take a weekend trip, or a week, if only one person is using the handle, without having to pack the charger. There is room for two brush heads in the travel case."

I wouldn\'t pay 100 something dollars for a toothbrush but since Oral B had a 50 percent rebate I jumped at the chance to buy this toothbrush. It promotes positive teeth brushing and even gives you a smiley face after you are done for a job well done. After awhile my teeth feel cleaner and breathe is fresher. I like how it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me to brush my teeth and the travel case is a nice addition too. If you are looking for a toothbrush then look no further this is the one for you.My only grip is how expensive the brushes are I always try and look for specials or deals so I don\'t end up spending to much per a brush head. I also feel the battery life on mine doesn\'t last as long as I would like it to. I think on a full charge the battery light would flash after a week and a half which i feel is a little to short but its not a big deal. Get this toothbrush.
2133,2183,20110318,B002HWS9GG,5,"March 18, 2011",AW7BGAR3VSIY5,Great Toothbrush,"I bought the Oral-B 5000 brush after doing extensive research. This was my first electric or powered toothbrush. I will not compare it with Philips Sonicare as both are excellent brushes. I went with oral-b as I prefer a rotatory brush over a one that just moves up and down. If like me you are new to electric toothbrush and are wondering if it will be too harsh on your teeth and gums, then I can assure you that I found this oral-b 5000 very gentle. If fact, I would have preferred if it had a little bit more power. I have healthy teeth and gums so for someone who has very sensitive teeth this might be an issue. This brush however has a sensitive mode which reduces the power considerably so you can still go with it.The oral-b 5000 box came with a brush handle (oral-b trimph), 2 brush heads (1 flossaction. 1 prowhite), a smart guide, traveling case, a charging station (charging ring + brushhead storage stand) and a smart plug. An important note: only the oral-b 5000 and 4000 series come with a smart plug (100-240 V) adapter. Others 3000 and lower versions just work for US voltage only and you will need to buy a voltage converter if you want to travel with it. You can tell by looking at the pictures on the outside of the box. Smart plug is bigger as it has voltage conversion circuitry inside it, the other one is just an electric plug. Since I travel frequently, so this was very important to me and thus my choice was limited to 4000 or 5000 series only.Difference between the 4000 and 5000 is that 5000 has a smart guide and the charging station that has a place to store 4 extra brush heads, plus 5000 has one extra mode of operation. Other than that both are identical. The smart guide is not essential for brushing. It just shows you various information like the brushing mode you are using, total brush time, low battery indicator, over pressure warning. It also similes and winks at you! I find it convenient as all the information is in front of me, and if I wanted to change my brushing mode, I do not need to take the toothbrush out of my mouth. The toothbrush always starts in the daily clean mode and you cannot turn it on outside your mouth, as it then sprays toothpaste all over the counter and sink, so if it was not for the smart guide, you will find it very difficult to select the desired brushing mode on the toothbrush.The brush handle and brush heads are made in Germany. They appear well-constructed. The brush handle is water proof and factory sealed against moisture. This is very important as otherwise the moisture will ruin the battery and the circuitry inside, a common problem with electric brushes powered with replaceable AA batteries. The toothbrush is charged through magnetic induction, so it is safe to put the charging station on the bathroom counter, near water. Brush heads are easy to clean and replace. In fact, more than 1 person can use the brush handle, as the only thing that goes into the mouth is the brush head and each person can use their own brush head. The brush heads come with their own colored rings, so you cannot mix your brush head with someone else. The battery life is good and with my typical brushing time of 4-5 minutes twice a day, it lasts for 4-5 days.Finally, about the price. I got the 50% off offer, so the 5000 ended up costing me about $65. It was an excellent deal for me. Is this brush worth $159? Well, I would have to say no. If you can get it for below $100 then it is an excellent deal. Is it better than a manual toothbrush? I would have to say yes! It is 200% better than a manual toothbrush. In fact, after using this you will wonder why you did not switch before.Now, if the brush handle lasts for 3 years and each brush head lasts for at least 5 months, then I will be satisfied with my $65 down payment on this toothbrush.I hope my review was useful. I have tried to concentrate on information I did not find in other reviews. If anyone needs additional information just write a comment on this review and I will respond."

I do have to say that the wireless \'Smart Guide\' thing seems like it\'s not really necessary. It times you 30 seconds for each quadrant of your mouth, for a total of two minutes (maybe it would be good for a child??).  But, it\'s also a clock, and makes a good little clock for the bathroom!

Been an Oral B user for over a decade,"Oral B SmartSeries 5000The Oral B 5000 is the top of the line electric toothbrush. I used to have an older Oral B from the late 1990s that worked well up until the point where I couldn\'t find it around my house. The Ni-Accu battery pack was running strong and I could have used it for another 5-10 years. Then I got a few Oral B Vitality units from the dentist for free, which use inferior Ni-Cd batteries and have a battery life of about 3-5 days with regular usage. My old Oral B could last 3 weeks on a single charge.The cool aspect of these Oral B units is that a lot of their brushes are compatible. The Precision Clean, Sensitive, Polishing, and new Floss Action are interchangeable with a few exceptions  (like the Cross/Dual action garbage). The Floss Action worked horribly in my Vitality, but seems to work incredibly well with this SmartSeries 5000. I think it has to do with the RPM/speed of the motor. The Vitality comes across as grindy/noisy when it is operating, while the SmartSeries 5000 is smoother and faster.While brushing in the Daily Cleaning or Sensitive modes with the 5000, the Floss Action brush really works to clean my teeth and gumline. It doesn\'t hurt like it did with the Vitality! The Precision Clean brushes are probably the de-facto standard, but I invite you to try the Floss Action heads just to see how it feels. I also have the Sensitive brush heads that I want to try later on. I can tell you for a fact that my teeth felt cleaner brushing with the same Floss Action head on the Smart Series 5000 versus using the Vitality or a regular tooth brush.What does the Smart Series 5000 offer over other brushes? Well, the 5000 has a LCD indicator on the unit itself to tell you the battery\'s state of charge. Neat gimmick, but I have wondered in the past whether my toothbrush was good to go in terms of state of charge. Wonder no more, because you get a bar graph indicator!The 5000 has 2 buttons: one to turn on/off and another to select different cleaning modes. It defaults to daily cleaning (same as Deep Cleaning), and progresses to feather/sensitive, massaging, polishing, and deep clean. The Deep Clean changes the timer to increase the amount of time for your brushing, but it is the same speed as the daily cleaning mode. The timer defaults to counting up, and fluctuates the brush head speed every 30 seconds to tell you to switch quadrants in your mouth, and does the typical Oral B twitch at 2 minutes to tell you that you\'re done.The wireless timer/clock module is a neat gimmick offered on the 5000 and not the 4000. I don\'t find that it is particularly mandatory, but It does have a clock and changes to a timer when you use the brush. It also lights up a red LED if you press too hard on the brush head while brushing. While experimenting, I found that you really had to jam down on the brush head to cause it to cut power to the brush. Chances are you\'re not brushing hard with an Oral B because you want the RPM\'s to do the work with the brush. I tried SonicAire and other products, including Oral B\'s cross-action, but found the traditional Oral B to be the ultimate.The Smart Series 5000 comes with 1 Floss action head and 1 polishing head. The bristles are also indicators, you\'re supposed to change them when the blue color disappears halfway down. I find that this generally occurs every 6 months, and you can order new heads from Amazon for a lot less than buying them in stores (usually).The Smart Series 5000 also comes with a plastic hard travel case, and a slim charger unit that is more of a ring than a peg like on the older models. This makes cleaning a lot easier. The included battery is a NiMH cell, which means it has a much higher capacity than NiCd and doesn\'t suffer the memory effect. I am going to keep the Vitality as a travel brush, so if someone from the hotel nicks the Vitality, it\'s not a big loss.The Smart Series 5000 is a very smart investment for your personal dental hygiene. I brush with Oral B at least once a day (at night before I go to sleep). My dentist and hygienist always mention how clean my teeth and gums look, so the Oral B must be doing its job!Overall: 5/5 starsUPDATE: 4 MAR 2011After running the Oral B Smart Series 5000 without charging it, I noticed that I can easily get 10 days of normal routine usage (2-3 times a day for 1 person) before the battery meter starts blinking with 1 bar remaining. I used it for about 12 days and estimate I can get another 2-3 days before the battery is totally drained. As someone that travels routinely for business, I can opt to not bring my charger along for week long trips because I know the battery can last at the least 10 days before needing a charge. I\'d push it as far as 15 days!UPDATE: 19 NOV 2011I decided to push the Oral B 5000 as long as possible without charging it to see what would happen. After 22 days, it was still running fairly strong. I can detect a decrease in RPM because the voltage is probably too low. So that is roughly 44-60 minutes of total run time. It will easily handle most business travels without lugging around the charger. I noted that the low battery icon started flashing after 9 days of usage or roughly 18-20 minutes of operation, but it kept running and was still running after a total of 22 days on a single charge."

By the way,I don\'t miss the blue blinking charging light of the 9800 and this unit feels real good in the hand. Great price from Amazon too."

It came with a 50% off mail-in rebate that made it $61.00 which was a great price. It was $122.00 at the time so I feel like I got a great deal for a top of the line toothbrush. I bought this one to replace my older power toothbrush. It stopped working and would not turn back on one day. So I found this one and got it and do not regret spending the money to get it. I definitely recommend this toothbrush for anyone who likes to get their teeth really clean and feeling clean. This toothbrush comes with great features like five different cleaning modes which I use two of them so far and yet to try the others. It is a must get for really clean teeth.

Then we went back to manual toothbrushes for a while.  We realized that the manual toothbrushes didn\'t leave our mouths feeling as clean as the rechargeable toothbrushes, so we decided to purchase a Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.We purchased the Sonicare from Amazon and tried it for a couple weeks.  At first, we thought it did a very good job cleaning our teeth and gums, but it started feeling weak.  I\'m not sure if the toothbrush lost its full power after the first week, but the pulsating just didn\'t seem as good as our older Oral B.We returned it to Amazon as it seemed defective, and purchased the Oral B Professional Series 5000.  We\'ve used it for a few days now and it draws rings around the Sonicare.  The oscillating motion of the toothbrush alone leaves our teeth, gums, and overall mouth feeling much cleaner than anything we\'ve ever used; feels almost as good as a cleaning from the dentist.I highly recommend this toothbrush over the Sonicare.  Also, we are using the Oral B Floss brush heads.  They are tremendous and are much cheaper than the Sonicare brush heads as well."

But, according to my hygienist, I am a plaque producing maniac so it was suggested to me by her that I get one of these things.  The initial price shocked me but with the rebate, I could swallow spending a net of $50 on a toothbrush.  So far, I like it.  Not sure why anyone would \'need\' the little timer/clock thing that comes with it and I wouldn\'t suggest anyone spend extra money to have this feature. I have banished mine to a drawer as I do not have unlimited space in my bathroom. The toothbrush itself is a little bulky, but after a week or so, you get used to it. One of the features I do really love is the vibrate indicator.  After 30 seconds, it vibrates to tell you to move on to the next quadrant in your mouth.  What I am astounded by however (and kicking myself in the butt over) is the price of replacement heads.  I never thought to check on that before I bought this.  It costs about $25 for a 3 pack or about $12 for a single.  Also, I have yet to find a 3 pack that is a multi pack (i.e. different heads).  So, if you are like me, and use both the polishing and cleaning head, just using this toothbrush will cost about $9 every month to replace the heads.  As for how well it cleans...I am a smoker and a coffee drinker. I am also obsessed with clean teeth so I get mine cleaned by my hygienist every 3 months.  My teeth feel cleaner since using this toothbrush and if this toothbrush allows me to expand my dentist visits to every 6 months, the cost of the unit and replacement heads will be worth every penny (as I have to pay out of pocket for 2 cleanings a year b/c insurance only covers a cleaning every 6 months)If not, then I will be happy feeling as though I have cleaner teeth but will check this purchase off as a luxury and a \'want\', not a need. One other thing that I would like to point out is that, if, like me, you have limited bathroom space and outlets, this toothbrush is wonderful b/c you only have to charge it once a week. I was very concerned over where this unit was going to \'live\' as I need my bathroom plugs for my hairdryer and flat iron.  I do not leave the base sitting out and I do not constantly charge it. I keep the toothbrush in a drawer in the case (which is very nice) it comes with and simply charge it overnight every sunday."

All I used was the floss action brush head.After using the Oral B continually for about 3 months, I can say that the (oral B) delivers a much more powerful clean. Though the Sonicare was easier to reach the back teeth.  Both delivers a clean, smooth just left the dentist feeling.This thing is way thicker then my old Sonicare E series handle, the pictures on amazon don\'t show the side shots.  And compared to the latest and greatest sonicare, it\'s probably double the thickness.  Go to your local retail store to compare, if thin is in for you.The smartguide clock thing is pretty heavy and thick as well, keep that in mind if you want to find some way of wall mounting it.  If you have it free standing on your sink its hard to read unless your eye level (I\'m 6 3) or stand back a foot or two.  And , although some of the back is rubberized, it won\'t lean against your wall without falling.  I use fun tack to overcome this.  It comes with two sets of AA batteries, which was pretty worrysome to me because most companies don\'t even give one set but it is still going strong.  It\'s neat to know how far in you\'ve brushed and when to switch quadrants, and the \'studder\' helps better then the audible sound the sonicare makes. Smartguide will count up and down for you.Brush heads seems much cheaper then my sonicare.  A 6 pack in my local warehouse club costs $30.  About $15 for a 3 pk on Amazon, and even cheaper with subscribe and save.It charges a bit quicker then my sonicare.  The charger base is really tiny, takes up very little room.  It even snaps into the included 4 user toothbrush tray.  However, even when it\'s done charging the wall wart (power brick thing) stays slightly warm (warmth=energy consumption), so I\'d advise you to unplug after charging.."

The difference was immediate. My first visit to the hygienist after two months use astounded her. She told me she had allowed an hour for my cleaning as the calculus buildup on my teeth had been graded C on my visit 6 months previously. She said it was now an A, and was finished in 20 minutes(No discount). She was impressed that the only difference was an Oral B electric with the floss brush-head. As for the 5000 the difference is noticeable. Much longer battery life. Where the 3D was good for 3 minutes and then needed an hour charge. The 5000 will go at least 5 minutes with full power. Probably more. I got bored and ended my experiment after 5 minutes. I also like the fact it is only high speed with a 30 second pulse. I never saw the need for a slower speed option. The 5000 also has an open charging stand, eliminating the gunk buildup the 3D was prone to, and taking less counter space. As for the clock, I have no idea what it\'s for. Set up is simple. Just plug in the charger and set the brush on. The display will let you know when you\'re ready to go. And best of all you can\'t screw it up. The battery will hold a full charge whether you brush 1 minute or 5. No worries about running it down to achieve full charge like many cell phones.

Most dentists put the Oral B\'s at the top of the list, and I\'ve been very pleased with them, but this new one is a leap forward.All because of a simple improvement: it not only divides the mouth into quadrants and gives a little shake to prompt me to move from one quadrant to another, but it has a separate wireless display.  When the brush isn\'t in use, the display serves as a darned good digital clock, and when brushing, it converts into a timer and a map of the four quadrants, depicting which quadrants have been brushed.  Then, once the two minutes have passed, the round quadrant display turns into a smiling face, which grins if you\'ve really been brushing enough.And it\'s the darndest thing, but breaking it up into 4 quadrants not only shortens the perceived brushing time dramatically, but I for one--yes, it\'s embarrassing but true--actually want to \'please\' the display, and get that silly smiley face.  Worse than that, I want to get the big grin on the smiley face!No, I\'m not lonely, I have a lovely girlfriend who brushes right beside me, but we both find that these Oral B\'s turn the longest 2 minutes of the day into an all too short game that seems to last at most 30 seconds.  And the cavity-free dental exams are nice, too.The only negative point: as is the case with all previous Oral B electric toothbrushes I\'ve owned, after even a single brushing it seems to take impossibly long to completely recharge.  I don\'t have any other rechargeable appliance that comes close.  It\'s not much of a problem, but it does seem peculiar."

Just a week ago (Feb 16, 2012) the battery had gone dead on it. I was pretty happy considering it lasted over 6 years. Granted it was a little more expensive than the 5000, I still expect this SmartSeries to perform as good if not better. When reading the manual on this toothbrush I seen the section on the battery in it. It gave instructions on what to do if and when the battery goes dead on it. I tried to perform the procedure on my old Sonicare since they have the same basic structure. I couldn\'t seem to open the bottom of it and any suggestions would be great. However, I don\'t even know if the battery on that model is even replaceable. When I first turned on the SmartSeries 5000 I noticed a BIG difference that my old Sonicare. The sound was extremely different. The Sonicare had a tight buzzing sound that sounded very well built. The 5000 had more of a loose buzz. It is a bit louder and makes me question if its going to last half the time my old toothbrush did. Who knows, maybe this is a new addition that cleans your teeth better or maybe I\'m just so used to my old one that I question anything different. The Smart Guide system on this brush is pretty cool. If you have kids, it will definitely make them want to brush. There\'s a smiley face that gets bigger and bigger the longer your brush. You can stick the Smart Guide screen onto a mirror or the wall. The toothbrush also has a monitor in it that lets you know if you\'re brushing too hard. There is a red light that is very noticeable on the handle that lights up when your pushing too hard. It is compatible with 5 different brush heads that supposedly do different things. I don\'t know if this is just a selling point or what but I find it pretty handy. Overall, there is not much difference in the 1000, 1500, 3000, or 5000. Just a couple additions the higher the number but the basic stuff is going to be there with all of them. If I had to do it over I would have gotten a cheaper one. I thought getting the biggest and best one would have more advantages. It\'s still a good buy and I have no complaints as of yet."

I somehow managed to get periodontal gum disease about 3 years ago. My dentist found no physical cause for this (as I\'m young, do take care of my teeth and gums, and my medical exams/blood tests have all turned up fine). Anyways, after brushing my teeth with the Sonicare, I usually still see visible plague (sticky white residue) on some of my teeth/gums... no matter how much I aim the toothbrush at my gums, etc. Also, since my mouth is small, I always feel that the toothbrush doesn\'t really get the back of my four top front teeth (central & lateral incisors), due to the shape of the toothbrush. My hygienist has always favored Oral B for its smaller shape but I always thought Sonicare was the best that was out there. Anyways, I decided to switch over since our Sonicare was dying and Oral B had a 50% off promotional rebate. Sweet deal!!! After the very first use of this Oral B toothbrush, I didn\'t see any visible plaque! My next dentist appt. is in Feb., so I\'m extremely curious to see if my dentist and hygienist notices any improvements!Regarding Amazon\'s Customer Service, 1 STAR and that star is for the CS Agent #4 that assisted me (He/she really gets 5 stars... all other CS Agents get 0 stars!)So, Oral B\'s website clearly stated that the 50% off promotional rebate was valid for purchases from Sept. 1st through Nov. 30th. It also stated: \'participating online retailers will provide a printable rebate form with purchase\' and listed Amazon as a participating online retailer. However, the \'rebate forms for recent purchases\' link (at the top of Amazon\'s product description) provided us with a PDF link to an older rebate (valid for purchases by Oct. 31st). Also, when we clicked on the \'instructions\' link and followed the steps to see if any of our purchases qualified for a rebate, it came back saying that our Oral B purchase didn\'t qualify for any rebates. (We decided to go this route before contacting CS in the hopes that we could obtain the correct rebate through a different method on Amazon\'s website.)So, I contacted Amazon\'s CS via chat, tell them my problem, provided the links to Amazon\'s product page and Oral B\'s product page (for their reference) and requested that they send me the new and/or correct rebate form. Here goes my frustration:- CS Agent #1: Reads my message, puts me on hold to research, comes back and tells me that my problem is that the rebate was for purchases made by Oct. 31st and I didn\'t qualify since I purchased the product in Nov. DUH! I KNOW THAT! I proceed to resend him the link to Oral B\'s site that clearly stated the new promotion and that Amazon was a participating online retailer. CS Agent #1 tells me \'We support a wide range of mail-in offers, but this particular offer is a transaction between you and the manufacturer. If you need more help with the offer, I recommend contacting Oral B directly.\' Great. Useless. I asked for a phone number so that I could speak with someone and was provided with an Amazon CS phone number.- Called and spoke with CS Agent #2: Explained my problem, stated that CS Agent #1 was not helpful and if he could please assist. I also explained that CS Agent #1 was not aware of the new promotion, etc. etc. I was again placed on hold while he researched the issue and he also came back with the same line, \'that I purchased the product outside of the promotional offer.\' CS Agent #2 did not have internet access so I requested that he transfer me to a manager that had internet access and could see what Oral B\'s site stated.- Transferred to CS Agent #3 (who was a regional manager): He said that he was sorry that Amazon\'s website stated one thing while Oral B\'s site stated another. He can only submit my request to Amazon\'s marketing team and that they should hopefully send me the correct rebate on Monday (as I had called on a Sunday and Marketing was closed).During all this time (that I was on the phone), I was again on Amazon chat with yet another CS Agent... I figured... I must somehow be able to reach someone that understands and can assist!- CS Agent #4: I explained that I had already spoken to several people, explained my situation and asked that he/she kindly please research the links that I\'m sending before he/she comes back to tell me that I purchased outside of the qualifying promotional period. CS Agent #4 comes back and saves the day! Apparently, if you scroll further down the product page on Amazon, under \'Special Offers & Product Promotions\', is yet another rebate link... this time to the CORRECT FREAKING REBATE! YES! YES! YES! I was so thrilled that I thanked CS Agent #4 profusely. I also asked CS Agent #4 to tell the Amazon web team that the link at the top of the page refers to the old rebate, which is confusing when there\'s another link further down that refers to the new rebate.So, yes, I missed the second rebate link on the product page... but so did the first 3 Amazon CS reps! It took 4 tries to get someone competent to assist me.I also think it\'s pretty incompetent of Amazon\'s web team to 1) Not have the two rebates listed together under the same section... why have multiple rebates available on different parts of the page? And 2) when checking to see if your purchase qualified for any rebates (although a cool feature) was definitely useless in my case as it didn\'t register the fact that the Oral B toothbrush did indeed qualify for a rebate (that was apparently available after all on their website)!Phooey on Amazon for their customer service and web team.Other than this frustrating experience, I do enjoy shopping on Amazon.com... I guess it is safe and hassle free... as long as you don\'t require a rebate or customer service!"

My teeth feel cleaner and my gums look healthier.  I like the timer and pressure sensitive device (alerts you when you\'re pressing too hard).  The smiley face after the recommended time is cute too.  I prefer this over my former sonic cleaning device."

Set up was very easy and I was brushing my teeth within 5 minutes.  I like the timer that tells you when to switch to the next part of the mouth.  The brush can sit on the charger and stay charged all the time.  Takes up very little space on the counter.

I previously had the sonicare toothbrush but bought the Oral B on the recommendation of my dentist.  I got the 50% off rebate so the difference in price was about $4.  The separate timer really comes in handy...it doubles as a clock in the bathroom and is handy to see how much time you have left and what quadrant you are on.

2276,2328,20101123,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 23, 2010",A1BTRYQXG69NSK,Teeth never felt so clean,"I\'ve had severe plaque problems since I was a teenager (now 65). In the early 80s I had gum surgery because of it. I\'m supposed to go to the dentist every four months for a cleaning, but of course I don\'t go to the dentist near that often; maybe once a year if I\'m lucky. Anyway I always have a large plaque buildup when I finally do go to the dentist for a cleaning. The last several times I\'ve gone to the University of Pittsburgh school of dentistry where dental hygiene students do the work and the instructors check their work and correct the cleaning if necessary. Anyway I\'ve never had better cleanings in my life, but I still get severe plaque between cleanings. The last time I went the instructor recommended the Oral B 5000 toothbrush for my plaque problem. I thought I\'d give it a try and to say I\'m pleased is an understatement. I\'ve been using it now for five weeks after my last cleaning and as of yet I can feel no plaque buildup on my teeth. In the past by this time after a cleaning the plaque was starting to form when I used a regular toothbrush. I use the included timer and clean my teeth for a total of about 2 1/2 minutes. The feature I like is that you can get the molars clean. This was always a problem area for me in the past. Also the toothbrush will slowdown or stop if you press too hard. After a week or so you know what kind of pressure to apply and hone your cleaning technique. I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has a plaque or gum problem. One final note; I don\'t keep the charger plugged in all the time. I charge the toothbrush and can use it for eight or nine days before recharging. I\'m old school on this and feel the battery will last much longer if not charging all the time. I might be wrong on this, but I know at the very least it won\'t hurt battery life."

I was extremely impressed with it immediately.  I loved the feel of the floss brush on my teeth.  The brush and handle were much easier to clean than the sonicare.  I am very happy with this product.

For less than a week I did have some gum sensitivity like they mention, but after that the pain and problems went away.  I\'m amazed at how much cleaner my mouth feels and looks.  My teeth whitened a little bit at first and the overall health of my mouth improved greatly.  I will never switch back to a traditional toothbrush, even though it\'s costlier for this one and the refills.  I figure I\'ll save much more than that in the long run and just the way my mouth feels now makes it worth the cost.  The box comes with everything you\'ll need.  It had two brush heads included, a traveling case and an okay looking case for the brush heads (I still prefer to keep them in my medicine cabinet).  I definitely recommend this product, it\'s worth every penny!"

I had to buy a new one recently after I took my old Professional Care model to France and overheated it a bit...so, I bought this Smart model, since it was offered with a [...] rebate and seemed to be the latest in the Professional Care series.I have been using it a month now, and am quite happy with it\'s teeth-cleaning ability. I use all 3 different brush heads provided, but mainly stick to one speed, the daily cleaning.  I use the unit set on \'airplane\' mode, as a wireless display of where I am at what time in my mouth is just silly, a waste of a battery, and needless exposure to rf waves to boot.  One other downside is that the charger is in the plug, which sticks out @ 3 1/2 inches from the outlet, not a good look for a small bathroom counter.So, in future I will look for a non-Smart model and will remain perfectly stupid and happy with it. Hopefully that will not be for years."

However, I didn\'t receive the rebate certificate.  I sent a message to customer service at Amazon.com asking for the rebate slip or an explanation as to why it was not included.  I received no response, and that was about a month ago.As for the toothbrush, it is more powerful than the model I was using previously (also Oral-B) and appears to be more effective.  I liked my old Oral-B but this one is even better.As for Amazon, I am very disappointed.  In future, I will refrain from purchasing items from Amazon that are offered under a rebate.  The 50% discount was a significant amount of money that I lost by purchasing through Amazon instead of going to another location on Oral-B\'s list (e.g., Best Buy)."

I\'ve been a fan of oral B products ever since I was 18. I first bought the regular manual toothbrush and wasn\'t satisfied. I then bought the oral B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush, used it for about a month, and stopped. From then on I stayed using the man�al brush and was silent for about 3 years. This year I decided to give Oral B P.C. 5000 a shot. BOY o BOY, I cannot believe I didn\'t get this one earlier! When I first got it and after I took it out of the box, it was kinda confusing setting it up, and i� takes time getting used to it, but give it about 2 days you should have no problem. The Smart Monitor keeps you well-focused on which area you should brush. The brush heads that came with it are nice too. Mine came with the pro whitening heads and floss �ction. I\'m buying precission clean head soon. Overall it\'s easy to set up just give a little patience. I keep mine charging next to my bed on top of the dresser, sometimes I caught myself staring at it for a while because of how cool it looks :) Just to conclude and give you all a run-down of this amazing Electrical/rechargeable toothbrush:PRO:***Easy To Set Up***Smart Display Monitor that syncs with your tooth brush.

(For example: for SonicCare, when you charge the toohtbrush, the light  will turn orange. Green means its fully charged �nd Red means is low)But other than that this toothbrush is top notch!!!Like I said there\'s nothing better than Oral B 5000 PC SmartSeries.

Also, the base takes up too much counter space, since in addition to holding the charger, it includes a case for 4 extra heads.

In other words, not in hard plastic that had to be cut.  I have had it for only three days, so cannot evaluate the battery life, etc.  The toothbrush does a good job.  It is quick and thorough.  Two minutes go by in a flash and my teeth feel clean, even cleaner than some cleanings I have had in the dentist\'s office.The timer was very difficult to open.  There are two pieces of plastic covering the battery. Instead of sliding the top cover one has to press and raise it off the appliance.  (If this sounds confusing, it is.)  The second cover slides off.All things considered, I think I will be very happy with this toothbrush.  Did a lot of research before I bought it because the last electric toothbrush I had left a lot to be desired.  This is a winner.UPDATE:  I\'ve had this toothbrush for 6 months.  3.31.11 I noticed a yellow, sticky residue on the charger that appears to be oozing from the bottom of the handle.

I\'m a former sonicare owner.  I was excited to see if this would be better than my current brush..boy, was I disappointed.  The stupid timer thing is a waste of plastic and will probably end up in the trash.  It\'s useless and not a smart solution.  It waste battery and it\'s bulky.  Sonicare brushes just beeps and stops for a split second to tell you to move to the next quadrant (it\'s built into the toothbrush).  Also, this thing seems to just rotate and didn\'t do too well between the gap of your tooth.  With sonicare, it just sorta melts it was or the bubbles extract the stuff out.If you insist on this type of brush, buy the 4000 version...even if the 5000 is cheaper (which is not)...because it\'ll save having to buy batteries or waste the planet\'s resource.Again, I hate waste, stupid design, gimmicks.I want to see someone else support me on this.

A crest representative came to my office, presented information that made sense and had literature that this brush was the only toothbrush to show increased efficacy in independent testing.  Anyway I bought several for my parents and myself and have been impressed.What I like:-Makes your teeth \'feel\' noticeably cleaner, like they feel when they\'ve just been cleaned at the dental office-Wireless display motivates me to brush longer than I normally would, I\'ll be honest I don\'t know where they got the recommended 2 minute timeframe, but I do it to see the smiley face on the indicator-Wireless display has PRESSURE INDICATOR; I diagnose wear on teeth at the gum line multiple times everyday.  If this is an issue for you get this brush.  It\'ll save you money at the dentist and stop you from harming your teeth-Well made, handle is thin and ergonomic, charger has a small footprint on the counter, no electrical components exposed and everything feels sturdy-Wide selection of brush heads that are reasonably priced ($40 for a 2 year supply at Costco).  Two heads stand out to me.  The first is the funky looking one, which actually provides a floss like action between teeth.  NOT a substitute for flossing but I have noticed considerably less debris removed when I do floss after using this brush.  Also there is an orthodontic (braces) brush that gets in-between the teeth and the braces.  If you are plunking down the thousands for your child to have braces get this brush / attachment, otherwise when the braces a removed there is a good chance the teeth will have unsightly white halos around where the brackets were which is actually decalcification which is the start of cavities.Overall I\'m very impressed with this brush so it is most defiantly \'dentist recommended\' by myself.  My parents absolutely love it."

I\'ve always had severe gum problems and have had many gum grafts.  Until it dawned on me that I\'m still having gum problems so I switched to a new Periodontist who informed me that the Sonicare was tearing up all my gum grafts that were done.  He highly recommended the Oral B.  So I switched and what a huge difference.  It goes around the tooth which is what their instruments do at the dentist.  After using it for a almost 3 months, I can see a huge difference!  My gums and teeth feel clean but not all tore up.  I can\'t wait to go back to the Periodontist and show him the difference in my whole mouth.  The ORal B 5000 has a little digital clock that shows you when you\'re brushing too hard which has made a big difference in the way I brush and a 30 second timer to show you when to switch quadrants.  I\'ve always thought that really scrubbing my teeth was the way to go but not so! This brush shows you how to do it right.

It feels like you just left the dwentist after a very thorough cleaning each time you use it.If I could offer one suggestion it sould be that they should inform the purchaser in a much more prominant way that when you plug the charger in and put the unit in the base there is no indication it\'s getting any charge. I was about to return the unit thinking it was defective when, to my amazement, the charging indication finally came on AFTER the unit had been in the charging cradle for about 10 minutes. I would imagine that many folks will plug it in, put the unit in the charger, see no indication of charging and promptly return the unit as \'defective.\' it\'s not. That\'s how long it takes when you charge it for the first time to \'connect\' with the charger.

I hope that this will make my next dental check up go much better. ;) I would recommend this product even though it is a little pricey I think that a little money today will help prevent any more expensive dental work/dental treatments that would have been inevitable and even if this machine only prevents one dental treatment it would pay for itself.

I recently upgraded from a very old Oral-B electric brush and am quite pleased with the extended features of this new top-line model. I considered switching to a sonic type system but was dismayed at the variety of brush heads that are not interchangeable among the leading brand\'s models. Oral-B brushes are backward and forward compatible between models which means all the spare heads I had on hand work perfectly well with the new 5000. Anyway, it works very well in all modes and I like the ability to keep four different type brushes on the stand. The visual cues, timers and cleaning modes are very handy. The only drawback to this unit is the grotesquely large charger plug which measures 3.5\' long (excluding the prongs!). Seriously? What designer/engineer thought that was a good idea? There must be a way to achieve a charge without a such a titanic plug, like building the charging guts into the stand for example.

As a dentaphobe, I will always be grateful to Sonicare for keeping my mouth cavity free for my 7 year hiatus from the dentist- though to be fair, I also drank mostly water (vs. sugared drinks) and made sure to brush and floss twice daily, chewing sugarless gum throughout the day. Still, I found the Oral B a very nice upgrade for several reasons:1. NO ICKYNESS IN THE BRUSH HEAD!!! Sonicare brushes are notorious for getting all this disgusting gunk stuck up inside the brush head, leaving me with a sense of wonder about what exactly I was putting in my mouth, even after rinsing the head thoroughly in alcohol.2. Smaller brush heads. I finally feel like I am cleaning my wisdom teeth, which stick back almost to the uvula.3. Circular brush heads. Dentists always say to brush in circular motions, yet typical Sonicare brushes only go side to side.4. Using the floss-action head truly leaves less behind when I floss right after brushing.5. Another reviewer mentioned the fact Sonicare does not offer either soft bristled brushes or a sensitive mode.There were a couple downsides:1. Noise. The Oral B seems much louder, likely because the brush is moving in a circle vs. just side to side.2. Vibration Speed. One of Sonicare\'s main tenants for their brushes is that the sonic action itself gets rid of plaque/germs. The Oral B does not seem to vibrate quite as much- though flossing seems to yield fewer hangers-on, and does not just compact any recently-eaten food- such as cracker mush.There are other benefits, which Sonicare has also added to its latest greatest brushes, such as timers and better chargers. Still, I am happy with the switch- I\'ll just see if my dentist notices =)UPDATE; 2011- Going back to Sonicare.I had the brush about a year when the battery started dying ALL the time- would go from 3 of 4 bars to 0 bars in the middle of brushing. If you prefer leaving your brush plugged in all the time, this may not be a problem- but I like my batteries to hold some charge.Also, in the end, I do not feel like the brush is cleaning between the teeth as much as a Sonicare. Likely thanks to all the complainers like myself, I\'ve been exploring Amazon and noticing Sonicare has now created smaller brush heads with only the prong attachment/gotten rid of the ick factor of their bigger brush heads, and made the brushes overall less expensive (under $80).In the midst of the year\'s use, I sucked it up and returned to the dentist... to find I had 7 cavities =( While I obviously can\'t entirely blame the Oral B for this result, I again cite that the brush did not seem to clean as well between teeth/I miss the sonic action of the Sonicare- and did leave any late night cracker/chip remnants pushed down on my back teeth. So look for a new review of the latest Sonicare brush soon!"

I have taken it on trips up to 5 days and the charge holds fine without recharging.My only criticism is that sometimes when I am holding the handle I will accidently press the button that switches to the next brushing mode.  So I have to make sure I hold the handle low enough.  The handle may be made for a man\'s larger hand whereas with my hand I would like to hold it a little closer to the brush, but that is when I can hit the button.I would definitely buy this again."

The floss-action brush is really good at cleaning between the teeth, too, as I found out when I manually flossed afterward. Consumer Reports rates this toothbrush (previously called the Oral-B Triumph) very highly, as do user reviews on several websites, and the toothbrush has not disappointed. Check the Oral-B website for a $[...] rebate through June 2010!Included in the box is a pro-white brush (in addition to the floss-action), a charger and covered compartment for the brush heads, a nice travel case for the base, and extra batteries for the smartguide. There is adhesive tape for mounting the smartguide on a wall or mirror, but the smartguide sits nicely on the bathroom counter as well. I like the smartguide and its dual function as a bathroom clock. Very cool. It also keeps me on track as I brush.As other reviewers have noted, the battery cover on the smartguide is somewhat difficult to remove, and you have to take it off to access the buttons to set the clock. The plug on the charger is also rather large and takes up a chunk of space on the bathroom counter.  These are small annoyances, though.

It comes with three toothbrush heads: sensitive, floss, whitening. The sensitive brushhead one will forever remain in the closet. Really unless you have someone in your family who has different teeth from you, either you will be using the floss or the sensitive, not both, so really it comes with two brushheads, not three.2. It took me a while to read the manual, I didn\'t think it was all that clear on what I was supposed to do (I\'ve never owned one before) but it turns out that it\'s a lot easier than the manual suggests.3. I\'m not certain if the pressure signal works appropriately. After starting to use it, my teeth started to become more sensitive. Even though the timer thing didn\'t indicate I was brushing too hard, I decided to use less pressure and my teeth stopped being as sensitive.4. It doesn\'t tell me anything about usage of toothpaste.

I brook down and bought the version with the SmartGuide. My thought was what the heck even though I thought I did not require it. I have say that there have been times when I would have stopped brushing before 2 minutes are up because I thought 2 minutes had gone by. Note that the toothbrush pulsates every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants and pulsates three times at the two minute mark, so you don\'t really need the SmartGuide. It is still nice to check while brushing and the clock is a nice feature as well. For Christmas I got my wife the same toothbrush, but it now seems to be called the 5000. I have to say it is hard to figure out all the models and sets Oral-B creates. I told my wife that when you first use the toothbrush you will feel as if your teeth are going to shake right out of your mouth and she agreed. After a couple of uses, you become totally use to the brush. I have read negative reviews in which people stated this toothbrush makes their gums bleed, I can only assume they have gum problems and brushing action was too much for their gums. Without a doubt my teeth are much cleaner with this brush. I am not always good about flossing, and I would notice that when I got around to flossing again after period of not flossing that my gums were sore the following day. I noticed tarter build up as well. With the Triumph/5000, I never notice these problems now. Of course this toothbrush is not a substitute for not flossing, but I feel it really helps if you don\'t always floss. Our kids have now used our toothbrushes as well for the last few months and most importantly they are brushing for a full two minutes. Prior to this my son was closer to bushing for 10 seconds than 2 minutes. I figured too that the newness of the brush would have worn off with them, but they still seem to like it. Battery life is good as well. I get about 11 days between charges, but I also brush between 2.5 minutes and 3 minutes every time I brush. With that factored in I would say a 2 minute brusher would get pretty close to 2 weeks on a charge. Bottom line is this is a great product. So much so that I hauled it with me on an 8-day trip to Europe, and it went in my backpack not my checked luggage. I still take a manual toothbrush on overnight trips, but I sure hate not having this toothbrush with me."

It really goes by even faster that way- I thought it was going to be complicated, but it is much easier.  I like how the top part removes easily.  I pop it off after I use it and put it in its covered little tray.  This is an awesome toothbrush!  I am so glad I bought it!  And the price was very reasonable too!"

It\'s actually a pleasure to use; I never reach for my manual toothbrush anymore. There\'s a learning curve but not overwhelming.  Once I got the hang of it, I was amazed at how simple it was - put on the brush head, apply toothpaste, press the button and enjoy.  Rinse the whole thing under water, dry and stand in its recharger.  That\'s it. It has been very effective at removing old stains - without damaging my gums - something I found hard to do with a manual toothbrush.  It actually feels good to use and I often go a little longer than the timer suggests."

I purchased this to replace an old Oral B electric I had had for approximately fifteen years . . . and I used it daily until it died of old age.  While I always felt my teeth were clean with that old version, it truly *cannot* compare with this new and improved version!  I cannot express the difference in just how clean my teeth feel after using the 5000.  I considered the Phillips Sonicare simply because it is recommended by my dentist and orthodontist, but after reviewing the Oral B 5000 and seeing what it had to offer as far as options (not to mention all the rave reviews from other users), I decided to stick with the Oral B and I am glad I did.  It\'s truly an excellent product."

It sticks out of the wall about 3\', and I\'m worried that one day it will accidentally snag something or I will knock it off."

Those were the two top reasons why I purchased this product.  I knew I wanted to purchase an Oral-B.  I ordered the Oral-B 5000 Sunday 9-20, it was shipped 9-21 and I recieved it 9-25.  The order came from TeethNthings.  The product was packed ok but I received it banged up.  The postal worker wanted to blame it on poor packaging but it was packaged fine.  The product itself was fine.I have been using this product for a couple of days now so I must report that I am overall very happy and satisfied with it.  I read over the instructions twice, and when I used it for the first time, I was puzzled when I felt it doing small pauses.  The instructions are ok.  They could have broken it down dummy-style for some of us but oh well.  I was a bit confused about how to set the timing part, but I figured it out.  It could have been the excitement.If you buy this product, it will do these short pulses every two minutes.  After two minutes of brushing, the smiley comes up and winks.  So cute.  If you reach 4 minutes of brushing, it will do the pulse thing again.  There is a DVD that comes with it to explain their brushing technique of using the brush.  They break it down in 4 quadrants, 30 second intervals, two get in at least 2 minutes of brushing.The toothbrush itself is a tad bit noisier and heavier than my old ancient basic one, but let me tell you, boy does it go.  I feel like my teeth are getting a serious dental treatment, Spa Dente\'.  I don\'t know what this toothbrush will leave for the dentist to do, besides exrays.  To switch between the different brushing styles, you will push the triangle button while the brush is on.  The detached screen thing will tell you.  I use it in sensitive mode.  If you are brushing too hard, it will flash red.  Be careful not to push it while brushing, as it would seem easy to do.I really really love how they have the charger.  It is small and not bulky, which is perfect for travel.  Pretty smart how they did that.  The charger base is your travel base as well.  I really really love the blue travel case that it comes with so you can store two brush heads.  That is so neat.The best thing about this toothbrush is that it really gets your teeth, gums and mouth clean.  The smell of my breath has improved also.  It does a wonderful job.  I am very very pleased and would recommend this toothbrush to anyone.  It is a little expensive but it is well worth it to me.  I hope if you purchase this you will enjoy it as"

I have problems with brushing my teeth too hard, even using the softest manual toothbrushes.  This brush is awesome, you can\'t brush too hard because it will stop working if you do and my teeth are so much cleaner even flossing is much better.  This is the BMW of toothbrushes in my opinion.

He recommended to me these following products:1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson & Johnson5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.This is the regiment he advised me to follow:1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it\'s the best time of day for using fluoride.3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \'glides\' right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \'grips\' the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it\'s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don\'t even think about it!5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don\'t have to wonder \'did I brush good enough\'. It tells you when you are done!CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  Once you get through \'the tunnel\' using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care!I wish you happy, healthy teeth!"

Like the Smart Guide/Clock timer because I used to walk around the house for the two minutes until the pulse timer went off so I never knew if I was missing spots - now I stay pretty much on track. It is a little confusing at first but it\'s not really difficult to use. I\'m not exactly a rocket scientist so if I can do it anyone can.  There are a number of things that you have to learn and get used to and decide what the most comfortable settings are for you.  I will get a couple of the recommended brushes, especially the \'floss\' brush.  They are fairly expensive but I think they last a long time.  The unit is a tad heavy in comparison to my old Oral B, but it didn\'t take long to get use to.  I think my teeth look brighter and feel cleaner than with any other brush I\'ve ever used.

Anyway: it\'s nice because you can rinse out the head of the brush separately from the body to prevent water from sitting there and gook from growing.

I have owned each for about 8 months now and I have to say that each brush has its own pros/cons and this is her favorite.  The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior/interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes some adjustment on the part of the operator.  I found that my gums could handle the Sonicare, but my girlfriend gums are more sensitive and she uses this Oral-B exclusively.  The motion of the brush is much more softer and the replaceable brushes tend to fit right over each tooth.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  I like having the ability to brush my tongue which is much more difficult with this brush."

I have always loved these brushes because the bristles are so stiff.  They remain in almost new condition for a couple of months.  They do a wonderful job cleaning and brushing is a pleasure instead of a chore.  (I have tooth sensitivity and I love the stiff bristles--soft bristles bother my teeth.)  Today I accidentally picked up the Crossaction Pro-Health and I was certainly disappointed.  I noticed the last set of bristles was green instead of white and the head size said large instead of full, but I thought Oral-B had just done a product makeover.  To my disappointment, the Crossaction Pro-Health cannot compare to the original Crossaction.  I just bought the Pro-Health today and the bristles are softer than those of my 3 month old used original Crossaction brush.  If Pro-Health was in big letters and they didn\'t look so similar I wouldn\'t complain, but the toothbrushes look exactly alike and Pro-Health is *tiny* on the packaging, so small that I didn\'t even notice it until I got the packaging out of the trash to include the UPC in my letter to Oral-B regarding the suspected makeover.  And that is how long it took me to realize that Oral-B hadn\'t done a makeover, I just bought the wrong brush.  Ugh...  Do yourself a big favor and buy the Oral-B Crossaction Toothbrush instead of the Oral-B Crossaction Pro-Health Toothbrush.

The crossaction bristles get more of the \'crevice\' plaque located within teeth as well as a power toothbrush. And the tongue scrubber on the back gets my mouth first-date fresh!

I purchased they for the rest of the family and my 11 year old is doing a much better brushing.I\'ve never had any problems with this toothbrush running low on power, even when I\'m away from home (and the charger) for a few days.Original Review: (Sept 2010)I\'ve been using the Oral-B power toothbrush for a few weeks now and I\'m very pleased with it. Other electric toothbrushes did an ok job, but they usually had problems with getting gummed up with residue or lacked much in the energy department.The Oral-B power toothbrush has a brush head that\'s about 1/2\' in diameter that consists of a small rubber cup in the middle and is surrounded by bristles on the edges. I\'m able to maneuver it easily to the every tooth surface and get the some spots that I couldn\'t get to with a conventional brush. I find that I\'m able to get away with using about half of the toothpaste I did before. As a result, much less is wasted and there are no excess globs of toothpaste getting washed down the drain.One feature I really love is the inductive charging base. It doesn\'t have any exposed contacts, which means the brush is easy to rinse off after I brush. The base is easy to keep clean for the same reason.The power switch is behind a flexible rubber part of the grip and is easy to turn on and off. The brush isn\'t especially quiet when it runs, but that\'s not a big deal. It\'s not deafening either.It\'s doing a great job keeping my teeth cleaned with much less effort than a regular brush. I\'m very happy with it."

The case is 100% waterproof sealed, and power is drawn by setting the brush on a holder base so that power is transferred with no risk of electric shock. Very nice.-The brush pulses a couple of times to let you know when you\'ve done your time. Brilliant.-And it comes with an extra basic brush head.Cons:-Rattles your head like a jackhammer, negating most of the positives the moment it touches your teeth. The motor is relatively slow and cheap, so until you\'ve used it for a while and learned to adapt you\'ll be concerned that it\'s going to knock your teeth out before you\'re done cleaning them.-Standard brush head is only okay. You get the most basic brush head out of the box, which to me feels only so-so for cleaning. I sometimes have to run my brush for an extra cycle to feel really clean.Overall, if you want to try a power brush but you don\'t have the money for a more expensive model, this isn\'t a bad choice- it\'s still better than a manual brush. However, in the realm of power toothbrushes, you can and should do better. When you weigh a lifetime of painful dental cleanings and potential surgical issues from cavities against the (hopefully) one-time investment in a good power brush, there\'s really no reason to stick with an underpowered model like this that\'s going to rattle your teeth like it does.However, I\'m still going to be reusing this model for a long time to come- craft and cleaning experts know that there\'s nothing like a cheap power toothbrush for doing tasks like detail cleaning leather. For this application, this is an absolute wonder of a brush. It\'s cheap, and all the jackhammering works just fine when it\'s done on something other than your head."

The body of the toothbrush is lightweight, it tells me when it\'s time to stop brushing, and the polishing head REALLY gets those black tea stains off my teeth.The polishing head might be a little too vigorous, because it actually hurt my gums in one area where I brushed too hard. But if you\'re careful, this is a great toothbrush head on a fantastic toothbrush. I\'m definitely seeing better results than usual.I also really like the small size of the stand. It looks very minimalist on my bathroom counter, unlike the behemoth I had with my old toothbrush."

The toothbrush has a timer to make sure you brush long enough. The bristles are medium, the head of the toothbrush is smaller than the Spinbrush yet more powerful and faster.So far we love it.

To be on the safe side, I charged it for the full 16-hr recommended charge time before initial use.  It comes with two identical interchangeable brush heads.  I plan to have my two young children use the brush, however, the brushes are identical, with no markings to distinguish them, so I marked one brush at the base with a permanent marker to indicate the difference.  The brushing action is robust and does a good job of scrubbing tooth surfaces.  There is no need for additional pressure or manual brush strokes.  The brush has a built-in timer and makes a stuttering sound after you have brushed for two minutes.  My kids enjoy the brush and don\'t find it overly harsh or difficult to use.  I was quite pleased with the results and feel it does a better job than relying on them to properly use the manual brush.  The two-minute timer also makes sure they brush for a sufficient duration.  We\'re approaching two weeks of use without a recharge.  That\'s pretty good battery life, considering it\'s used twice a day by two people.  So it\'s a pretty good brush, especially if you have kids or don\'t want to spend a fortune on one of the fancier more expensive power toothbrushes."

I thought that was way better than our manual toothbrushes, but thought I\'d give this a whirl.  It makes a HUGE difference!  For one, the head is much smaller than the SpinBrush.  It\'s just one rotating head, whereas the SpinBrush has a rotating head and another section that goes up and down.  While I thought the rotation wouldn\'t leave my mouth feeling as clean as the double-motion head of the SpinBrush, it actually felt better!  Perhaps the smaller head allows it to get to more places in my mouth, or perhaps it is that the rotation looks, sounds, and feels much faster.  The SpinBrush is battery powered and even with new batteries, I don\'t think the top head spun as fast as this bad boy.  While this toothbrush costs more than the SprinBrush, it\'s still relatively inexpensive and since you can replace the heads, it\'s still a good option for those who don\'t want to spend top dollar on an electric toothbrush.  Overall, I love this toothbrush.  We will see how it stands up over time, but for the week I\'ve been using it, I feel like my mouth is cleaner."

Like Sonicare, this model is using the \'proximity\' charge method where you place the toothbrush\'s body on the base and charging takes place when the base is plugged into an electric outlet.- Extra brush - this model comes with 2 brushes, one mounted on the body and one extra.- Easy brush replacement - you simply pull the mounted brush to take it out, push the new one in.- $3 coupon to be used when purchasing replacement brush heads.Not so good or annoying:- The packaging is atrocious. It comes in one of those bullet-proof clear plastic enclosures that you must cut with scissors and make sure you don\'t cut yourself in the sharp edges while at it. It took me several minutes to extract the contents off packaging and I did manage to do it scratch-free.- Vibrations are a little too strong - this MIGHT be my Sonicare bias (which I\'ve been using for longer than I can remember) but I felt that this VITALITY was a little too aggressive. My teeth are a little bit sensitive and they didn\'t like that.- A little too noisy for what I am used to - of course, an \'ultrasonic\' toothbrush noise is harder to detect because... it\'s ultrasound.When compared to the higher-end products, it may be worth noting that the VITALITY does not come with a \'full\' timer. The toothbrush does tell you when the 2 minutes are up (noise similar to revving an engine) but it does not turn itself off and, more importantly, it does not give you 30-second signals so you can switch \'quadrants\' as the higher end products do.The VITALITY offers a lot for the price but I am not sure that \'price\' is THAT meaningful when the topic is our teeth. It\'s probably preferable to most manual toothbrushes but, for a few dollars more you can get a lot better. Overall this is a decent product but if I had to replace my higher end toothbrush today, knowing what I know after trying out this product I would NOT go for the VITALITY and sacrifice features and convenience. The few dollars saved would not justify it.Three stars, meaning \'It\'s Okay\' seem to be the fair rating on the Amazon scale."

This toothbrush wowed me from the moment that I took it out of the box. First I have to point out that it comes FULLY CHARGED. Since when does an electronic item arrive at your door without needing charging? I was able to take it out and to use it immediately! The next thing I noticed was how much lighter it was than my three year old sonic toothbrush. It was more slender, shorter, and much, much more comfortable to hold. When I pulled the base out of the box I was simply astounded - how could something so small be a charger? I\'d been used to this huge base and now all I had to deal with was this tiny little thing, barely big enough to fit the base of the brush, but it did and it was extremely sturdy as well.The big challenge, though, was the brushing. My Vitality had a 2 minute warning feature on it, where it sort of stutters in the vibrations when two minutes is up. I loaded up the toothbrush with toothpaste and started the brushing. I could immediately notice the difference from my new Oral-b to my old sonic toothbrush, as this one rotated instead of just going up and down. I could simply gently guide the brush from one tooth to another, just like my dentist does, and the teeth were getting cleaned!Two minutes actually took much longer than I thought, and I was a bit ashamed to realize that I hadn\'t been brushing a whole two minutes for quite awhile! But eventually the stuttering happened and I turned off the brush and looked closely to see what the cleaning had done.WOW. Not only did the brush get in between a lot of my teeth to get some things that would normally be gotten by flossing, but it also polished my teeth as well! I was able to run my tongue around my teeth and was shocked to realize that my teeth felt exactly the same way after my home cleaning as it does after I\'m done a visit at the dentists.I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and am interested in the different heads that you can get to go on the toothbrush! If this head does such an amazing job, I wonder how good the other heads are!"

(Though it would have been nice if one of them had a different colored ring, as some brands do, so we could tell them apart more easily.) The first thing he said to me after trying was, \'Wow ... it\'s a little aggressive, isn\'t it?\'It IS a little powerful, but boy does it ever get your teeth clean! Both of us noticed after just two or three days that our teeth were noticeably whiter and less stained. They also just FEEL really clean -- that \'just left the dentist\' feeling (the clean part, not the Novocain part).The only reason I\'m not rating this five stars is because it may be too much for those with really sensitive gums, and I\'m also a little curious about what long-term use could do to enamel if you\'re not careful.

Upon brushing, it creates a back-and-forth spinning motion and a vibration that is akin to the polishing machine at the dentist\'s office.  There is no doubt that it is superior to traditional brushing in terms of effort to brush and how clean your teeth and mouth feel.  Given the relatively low-price, this could be an excellent option for some.However, I\'m a regular user of the Sonicare (I use the slightly older Elite series), and I can say that I prefer the Sonicare.  After several days of switching back and forth, it was clear to me that the Sonicare is simply better at brushing between teeth and getting the mouth to a clean feeling while being more gentle.  The Oral-B feels more like a polishing experience, whereas the Sonicare seems to get deeper between the teeth and gums and really get things clean.That being said, in reading the literature, it seems that the Oral-B products--at least the Professional Series--are superior to the Sonicare in terms of cleaning plaque (e.g., Biesbrock AR, Walters PA, Bartizek RD, Goyal CR, Qaqish JG. Plaque removal efficacy of an advanced rotation-oscillation power toothbrush versus a new sonic toothbrush. Am J Dent. 2008 Jun;21(3):185-8.).  I found this very interesting.  What I am not sure of, however, is whether or not this lower-priced Vitality line is the same as the more expensive professional series, and if not, how it differs.In sum, this is an excellent electric toothbrush that seems best suited for cleaning the surfaces of teeth extremely well.  I found it to be a little bit rougher and a little less capable of cleaning between the teeth and gums as the Sonicare (which has a larger head, softer bristles, and creates sort of a deep foaming feeling between the teeth).  Still, recommended indeed."

I brush and floss at least once a day, maybe two if I have time.  Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.Then this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information - you find out that the brush tells you how to time your brushing.  It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  Yes, and further, the brush signals you to change.Quick reminder, after you put the toothpaste on your brush, press it to your teeth before turning it on, otherwise you get to spend some time cleaning toothpaste off the bathroom mirror, walls, and perhaps ceiling.  One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over the entire area - front, bottom, back, and gumline.  After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.  I was impressed.After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  I rinsed, and looked in the mirror.  To my surprise, I could already see a change in my teeth.  It was slight, but noticeable to me.  After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost."

The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush. I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well. Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH. I stand by this toothbrush as a high-quality product. It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.>>I have 5 dental implants, so taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.At a recent visit to my dentist I was told I had receeding gums around one of my implants. The problem? Part of it was that the implant crown wasn\'t seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard. The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.I went to Target and bought their generic \'Up & Up\' brand electric toothbrush. This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums. However, when the Oral-b 3000 came out on Amazon Vine, I knew I had to order & review it.The Oral-b 3000 does NOT disappoint. For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic \'Up & Up\' model I was using before. Second, it actually lights up when you\'re brushing too hard. I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I\'m distracted and in a hurry to get to work. It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.Another nice feature is the \'timer\' function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits. This is also nice, as many of us tend to hurry through our brushing routine. The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom. The brush unit\'s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn\'t notice a decrease in power. This is a nice contrast with my Up & Up toothbrush which, though it claims it\'ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.I\'ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far. My old unit is in storage and probably won\'t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas. I haven\'t made use of the different brushing modes, but I\'m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth, will appreciate these.All in all the brush unit, brush head, and charger included in this package are all great and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than, the competing brands/brushes. The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth & gums, the unit pays for itself handily. I recommend!"

Being smaller in head size, it is easier to maneuver and I feel it does a better job getting  to all the teeth surfaces.  I love the added bonus of the 30 second timer on  the 3000.  At first I thought something was wrong when every 30 seconds it would seem like the toothbrush was powering down, but it just is a timer to let you know to move on.  It has a 2 minute timer so you can focus on doing 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  How fun is that!  The red \'too much pressure\' light is also handy, and I had to push pretty hard to get to light up, such that is was uncomfortable on my teeth.  Some of you may need the warning light, but the pain was enough for me to stop the pressure.  I do like this toothbrush, but I also agree that it is costly and buying replacement heads are costly, so it is a continuing investment.  Still, these clean so much better than manual toothbrushes.  My kids have been using them for years and between the two of them they have had 1 cavity.  So perhaps these do pay for themselves in the long run."

I am a bit taken back by the sensation of the whirling brush head, but I have to say that my teeth feel much cleaner than they did with manual brushing.The red light that indicates too much pressure is a good thing for me, since my dentist has said that it appears I brush my teeth too hard. (Edit: The red light now flashes randomly whenever the brush is on. I\'ve used this for less than a week and it\'s broken already.)I am, however, extremely surprised that at this price you only get one brush head, and that the battery is not replaceable (all rechargeable batteries have a limited life span).I can\'t promise you that it is worth 2x to 4x the price of some of the other powered toothbrushes you can buy, but I do like the extra-clean feeling I get with it."

Great when traveling so I don\'t have to pack the charger also. For longer trips I love the compactness of the charge base.The charger base separates from the extra brush holder so it doesn\'t take up much space on the counter and is sleek, clean and modern looking while saving counter space.

Clearly they got the source of the stain wrong, and I\'m not so sure about the brush.My research led to the purchase of the Oral-B 3000.Oral-B and Sonicare seem the brushes of choice, and my research gave Oral-B a slight edge, though I\'m reconsidering. Reading reviews also gave the Oral-B floss action brush head a slight edge, and I\'m inclined to agree; though it certainly doesn\'t replace regular flossing, so far it seems to be keeping the staining abated.The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist\'s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. Primarily, the mode switch is a source of frustration, for the brush can not be shut off without going through all three modes. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000."

Oral-B also makes the 1000 series model.  There\'s nothing wrong with this I am sure, however I believe it doesn\'t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  The only downfall is that about once a week you do have to charge the battery (which does take about 17 hours).  Honestly, that\'s not a big deal.  The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  It has room for additional brush heads.  It\'s a nice feature, but something I really don\'t find the need for.  Overall, those are minor things.  I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains."

My dentist (who just so happens to be my favorite medical professional) has been relentlessly hounding me to come over to the electric side.

Of course, upon examination of my rear molars she\'d wax philosophical about those who properly brush for the full two minutes, and follow the listerine-floss-brush system every single day.  Finally, I gave in.  Mostly because I lost my dental insuranc. I figured I should step up my home cleaning to make up for missing a routine cleaning or two.Now for the technical:The setup was completely intuitive.  It came with a multi-page english/spanish instruction booklet, which being human, I did not read.It has three modes of cleaning, I really only use the one.  Every 30 seconds it makes a little pulsation, which allows you to time how long you clean each toothy-hemisphere.  (30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right) This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.  Like lying on the couch with the dog and the boyfriend.  Comfortable, perfect.I swear my teeth are cleaner looking.  I don\'t swing with that whitening paste, it ruins your enamel.

I like using electric toothbrushes because I have forearm and elbow pain from the manual tooth brushing up and down action. Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms. I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  The negative reviews I read seemed like they were isolated instances of the toothbrush going out shortly after purchase, and was not the \'norm.\'  I thought that if I ended up with a \'bad egg\' toothbrush, Amazon would replace easily (as stated in some reviews I read).  I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  And surprisingly, the little \'rubber pieces\' that act as \'floss action\' actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums feel great and look clean after brushing.

However, this toothbrush is GREAT in comparison to an old fashioned toothbrush or a battery-operated on.  Every time I use it, my mouth and teeth feel so clean, like after I go to the dentist.

In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.This Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more toothpaste.What I do like:>>  The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all.  Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  Trust me on this.>>  The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.>>  I love the rubber grip handle.  My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.>>  Will go over a week between charges.  I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging.>>  Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.What I do NOT like:>>  No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.>>  The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I\'ve ever encountered.  My knife gouged into the rubber hand grip and I nearly cut myself twice.  If you have the option of choosing this with frustration-free packaging, get that one instead.I hate visiting my dentist. Since I\'ve been using these Oral B brushes, my exams are so good my dentist is pleased with me, but he\'s not making the money off me that he once did.The following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:1.  Precision Clean2.  ProWhite3.  Sensitive4.  Dual Clean5.  FlossAction (of course)"

This one highlights \'floss action\' and it gets the job done even better than previous models. Keep in mind that the toothbrush will not actually floss your teeth as it\'s simply a selling point to highlight that it reaches places that others may miss. If this toothbrush is anything like my previous Oral B purchases, it will be with me for a long time.One should keep in mind that the replacement heads for these toothbrushes is not cheap. I would also compare them to the price you pay for cartridges as the manufacturer looks to minimize the initial outlay (as is the case with printers) while cashing in later. I still think that this product accomplishes much more than a conventional toothbrush and that in the end it does not turn out to be as expensive when compared to how long these refills last."

I\'ve had a Sonicare for years and I thought nothing could compare. I was wrong -- this one works great. I received the head that has floss action and I\'m planning to try a couple of the others. That\'s one big advantage of the Oral B -- you can buy different heads to use for different purposes. The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.My only complaint is that there\'s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it\'s fully charged or when the charge is low. It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors. When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working.

It\'s lasted an amazingly long time; the battery has just recently started having trouble keeping a charge. (Mechanically, it still works perfectly.) So, I decided to try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush.Compared to the Sonicare, the Oral-b is quite different. It\'s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \'sonic\' movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts. The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \'floss action\' rubber points work quite differently as well. At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth. Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice. I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.(One small issue wroth noting: all the included tooth brush heads look the same. It\'s awkward to share between two people because the different heads look identical. It would be nice to have different colored heads, like Philips provides.)"

This brush is far better than my previous one, to the point that I have to order a second one since my wife already stole mine for herself!Here are the details, mostly in comparison to the Crest SpinBrush I was using before.The good:* Rechargeable - big plus for me. I\'ve gone through a lot of batteries on the Crest brush.* Variety of replaceable heads - currently using the Vitality Floss Action but like the availability of other styles* 2-minute timer - automatically tells you after 2 minutes of brushing, great way to build that habit* Good speed, not too fast or slow, just feels right* Mouth feels cleaner after this brush than with my previous spinbrushThe Not-so-good:* No indicator for battery life - It is designed with the expectation that most people will leave it plugged in all the time, but I prefer to run my batteries down between charges and I didn\'t get much warning when it quit in the middle of a brush one night.Other than that, I love this brush.

The Braun manufactured brush comes with the recharger base and 2 floss action brush heads for under $30 from Amazon which strikes me as, perhaps, the best bargain of all available powered brushes on the market because of the high quality and effective design.I\'ve been using the Sonicare system for roughly the last three years and I do love it, but the handle is bulky and the brush heads are expensive to replace.  I always have wondered if there was anything out there that was as good or better?  Enter this system...It actually seems to clean every bit as good, maybe better, and it makes my gums feel much more \'alive\' than the Sonicare does.  Judging by sink remnants it truly does clean at least as well, if not better.  I\'m guessing the floss action heads are truly small engineering marvels as they do seem to actually do what the name implies.  The size of the head suits me well after initially getting use to it.  That, combined with the more svelte handle allows me to easily get to the back of my teeth quite easily, better than the Sonicare IMHO.It is impossible to ignore that this system comes in noticably less in cost than the Sonicare too.  I\'ll still, on occassion, use the Sonicare, but this is my new favorite because it\'s effective cleaning and I really love the better stimulated feeling of my gums.  In fact, I will just say it:  I feel my teeth are cleaner and my gums much more invigorated with this winning product.  For me there are few downsides to this unit that I can think of.  Maybe the only thing I\'d like to have seen added was a brush guard, or holder, for sliding around the brush head when traveling...Otherwise, Oral B has hit a real \'homerun\' with this product which I feel works great, I enjoy immensely, and is a decent bargain too."

My father and I both adopted the philips sonicare system. I got this for my mom who has some sensitive gums that the sonicare irritated when she tried my dad\'s unit.  She is satisfied with the oral-b design.Over the sonicare, this has a smaller brush-head which can get into smaller places easier.Unlike the original oral b brushes, this is rechargable which is a major plus when you get halfway through brushing and the batteries suddenly die.Personally, my preference is for the sonicare system as it really cleans well, but even my father has tried this and thinks it might be doing a better job than the sonicare.Time will tell and I\'ll update my review with new info as the checkups come in.  Since we had used the AA battery verion before, we had extra brush-heads to all try the unit which is good in a family environment.  I think we felt the purchase price of the sonicare alot more since I don\'t live at home and had to buy my own.  I think the pricepoint oral b managed to hit at 1/4 the price of the sonicare system is a very affordable way for people to add a powered brush to their oral hygene."

I\'m lucky to have a great dentist who is working to help me save my teeth and gums, but it requires a lot of vigilance on my part.On a friend\'s recommendation, I started using a sonicare elite.  That brush does a great job, but brush heads are expensive and a little on the hard side.  Every time I brush my teeth with that one, the sink looks like a crime scene by the time I am finished.  The Oral-b vitality did not rough up my gums nearly as much, and it costs about the same as a replacement brush pack for the sonicare.On the other hand, the brush head feels a bit more bulky in my mouth and my teeth don\'t feel quite as clean as they usually do, but I don\'t dread using it nearly as much as I do the sonicare.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this brush an 8, based on price (great), comfort level (nice and soft but bulky), convenience (the 2 minute timer is important), and cleaning (not quite as good as my other power toothbrush)."

I have however tried cheaper versions, including crest and cheaper Oral-B\'s. This one is by far the best out of the different toothbrushes I\'ve tried! Firstly, it isn\'t dependent on batteries; it\'s rechargeable, which is great, so you dont have to spend money buying batteries every few weeks. Secondly, this model can be used with a few different brush attachments. the floss action is nice because it has a small head, which makes it easier to get to the hard to reach back molars. If it\'s too small for you, you can always use one of the bigger head attachments (not sure which ones go with this model, but I\'m sure you can find out on the Oral B website or somewhere here on Amazon). This leaves my teeth cleaner than any brush I\'ve used. They feel as clean as if I had just come from the dentist! The battery life is great too! It will last me two weeks with 2x a day brushing before I have to charge it. This leaves my teeth so clean, I\'m not sure how much cleaner a more expensive brush would even get my teeth, so this is definitely worth it!"

So I ended up getting the Vitality ($24.99) instaed of getting the 5000 ($119-149) that I would not have been as happy with.

This brush is fantastic, the Floss Action head can be a little aggressive so I am getting a pack of Precision heads (they are super cheap, like $14 for 3) for back ups but most days I will use the Floss Action Heads because I felt \'dentist clean\' afterwards. I did read some reviews that said the heads wrer a little large, I have a small mouth and while the heads are thicker than a manual brush it was by no means unmanageable or uncomfortable.

They told me to charge toothbrush again.(Their argument is that when I was charging the unit, I was leaving it power \'on\'.) I did again with power \'off\' and this time it even does not function! The handle is become warmer!The toothbrush did not even touch the toothpaste!I know this problem may not be pervasive, but it indicates problems of the lower quality control of Oral-B and its unprofessional customer service. With these two serious problems, as to this power toothbrush model, I may not trust this brand anymore, unless they could provide me evidences to prove their high quality of their products.My recommendation is to try other brands or Oral-B\'s more advanced power toothbrush models. Do not even think about this model! Save your time and money!"

It\'s comfortable once you get used to it.The only downside is more for people who aren\'t used to electric toothbrushes- my gums were actually a bit sore for about a week after trying this at first.

These new heads are even a step above that.  The only draw back is they are much larger and are quite a mouthful.  But they work well so it is worth the trade off.

My more expensive model seems much more powerful (rightfully so) and also seems to have more \'rotation\' BUT DOES this less expensive model CLEAN TEETH and GUMS WELL? YES.Bottom line I guess is does it get the job done. It works. It certainly feels better than regular ole toothbrushes. It feels like the rotating head is really getting into the gumline.What\'s really nice is that this toothbrush and my other Oral-B both accept the same replaceable brush heads which is great since they usually come in packs of more than one.I recommend this product.

After using it for a couple weeks some of the bristles are pulling out when I brush and getting caught in my teeth.  There are two oscillating brushes and there are different brush heads that will fit the handle. The charge lasts many days.  It\'s a very good looking design with a two tone color on the entire handle.

The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  The brushing unit is waterproof so no worry about getting water or moisture on it. There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush. The unit uses a rechargeable battery, which the company claims can not be over charged, so you can store the brushing unit on the electric charger unit.I have used both a Phillips and Oral-B electric toothbrush and find that this rechargeable model does a comparable job in the cleaning of my teeth. I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back teeth.The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth. The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums. The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off. The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.The brushing bristles give an indication by fading in color to show when it should be replaced. I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package. Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long but it looks very similar to the brushing head I have used on my Oral-B electric toothbrush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model."

Feels Almost Like a Dental Cleaning!,"I\'m one of those annoying people who brushes, flosses and gets a sticker from the hygienist when I have a cleaning twice a year.  I\'m very, very fussy about how clean my teeth feel after I brush, and until now, I hadn\'t found a powered toothbrush that satisfied me.This toothbrush works amazingly well.  It gets every speck of plaque off of my teeth, even in the hard to reach areas.  Unlike an old powered toothbrush I once had, it doesn\'t require a special toothpaste, and can use your favorite kind.  Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  I\'m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time. (You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about oral hygiene.)The toothbrush comes with a sealed plastic charger, which will charge the brush overnight.  A full charge will give you a week\'s worth of brushing. (14 x 2 minutes) This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.  You can also store the brush on the charger, but this isn\'t the most ecological way of charging the brush.  It also comes with one refill, and additional refills are available here on Amazon."

I\'ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  My gums also feel massaged by the vibratory scrubbing they receive, hence that just-went-to-the-dentist feeling without the paperwork, wait, or cost."

(There are 2 brush heads included int he box.)  I don\'t really like to use it to brush my tongue so I still keep my old toothbrush on hand for that purpose.

If you don\'t care for the large dual clean brush heads (they are a little big) you can use any of the other heads that Oral-B manufactures.
3014,3097,20100824,B003UKR67M,5,"August 24, 2010",A2JE071UW97J2A,Oral-B Brushes Are The Best,"I have tried a variety of brushes, both power and manual, and have found that Oral-B brushes are the best, at least for me.I was initially a bit concerned about the size of the handle, it is \'fatter\' than what I am used to, but now that I have used the brush, I have no problem with the size; it fits well in my hand and I think that it causes me to use the proper position for brushing better than my previous brush.I like that it is rechargeable rather than using batteries, as I think this will insure better brushing over time as I tended to wait until the battery was about dead before I changed it. But by keeping the brush on its stand with the charging cord plugged in I should have maximum power for each brushing.  The instructions that come with the brush say you can leave it plugged in, but recommend that every 6 months you let the battery deplete itself.Like another reviewer, I have sensitive teeth and prefer a soft brush.  The brush head that came with the brush seemed to work just fine for me.  The test will be when I have my next visit to the dentist and learn whether there has been an increase in gum erosion since the last visit.  However, just based on short time use, I have no reason to think there will be a problem.  My brushing includes running the brush over my tongue and the bristles feel no different than my other brushThe brush heads that I used on the previous brush don\'t work on this, but the literature that comes with the brush describes 5 different heads that do.  Quite an interesting variety, including floss action, precision clean, white+clean, and sensitive clean.As is true of most electric toothbrushes, heads are pricey if purchased from a local stored.  Amazon sells them at a heavily discounted price, so it is a good place to buy head replacements.  What I do and recommend that others do is to buy a supply of brushes at a time in order to get the best price and insure you have enough on hand to replace a head every 3 months if used twice a day.  The per head price is cheaper if you buy a pack of 6 heads than if you buy the standard 3 pack.  Amazon has both."

I have been using it for all my brushings (at least 2 times a day) for the past few days and it does not hurt or irritate my teeth or gums in the slightest- so needless to say this is a keeper!The bristles are really working hard getting between the teeth and removing all the food particles and debris. The top part of the brush goes in circles and the lower part of the brush goes up and down and really gets in there-- and without irritating!The timer is great also! Sometimes I feel like I am rushing when I brush my teeth, but with the built in 2 minute timer, I know that I am not exactly rushing through and well, its doing a great job in those 2 minutes.I am not finding any left over food when I floss afterwards either which really shows that this toothbrush is doing its job.Also, since this is rechargeable, I dont have to worry about constantly changing the battery- so that saves time and money!!There is an extra toothbrush head that I decided to use one and my husband the other one.

In this price category the toothbrush should come with a Lithium-based rechargeable battery that provide constant power (i.e., speed), and not like this NiCd battery that becomes slower and slower.  5 stars for the toothbrush itself, but no star for the outdated battery technology, makes it 3 stars in my book maximum."

I know most people don\'t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn\'t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!Ok now for the research details:1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it\'s time to brush on another side.6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you9. It\'s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn\'t like to brush or doesn\'t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. It guides you so you know you are getting a great cleaning. Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it! So as you can tell I love it and I am very satisfied with my purchase! Good luck and hope it works amazing for you as it does for me and my family!"

I\'m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  When you have teeth that are not straight like I do the back sides of your teeth are very hard to reach and the smaller round head on the brush I find reaches the hard to get areas better than the longer rectangular brushes.  Doesn\'t straighten your teeth though.  Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I\'m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  I tend to think that is glamor over substance.  After all the brush is just rotating in an oscillating motion purre and simple.  It works and works well.  My model hesistates at the end of two minutes and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  You still need to floss and thats expected.  I have been very pleased with my last unit.  I didn\'t save the box and the model number isn\'t on it so I cant say which one it is.  I\'ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  Good product and will continue to use till new technology comes up with something better.

I got it about a year ago from my dentist\'s office, and absolutely love it.  The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...the savings is very significant!).I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn\'t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it\'s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren\'t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don\'t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)"
