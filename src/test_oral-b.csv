3,3,20111101,B00006ANDJ,1,"November 1, 2011",A22BHQZVYQ6WF,faulty,Bought the replacement heads as the price was great compared to retail.  Big mistake.  The brushes pinched the insides of my cheeks and lips.  Painful and downright horrible.  Thought the first head was faulty and tried the next.  It did the same - threw them away.  Should have asked for a refund.

32,33,20090724,B00006ANDJ,5,"July 24, 2009",ARQ945F4OIWVI,Excellent quality and value,"I purchased this from Mr. Bargain. As some others have noted, the package may have been imported from Germany. The text on the package is in several languages including English.It is a Braun product, not any imitation. I immediately started using one of the brush heads to test it. It seems perfectly normal and fine, exactly the same as the brush heads that came with the original Braun toothbrush.Mr. Bargain\'s service was outstanding. Within about 2 hours of placing the order on Amazon.com, I received an email from Mr. Bargain that it was being shipped. The email included the USPS tracking number. I received the product the next day by US Mail, packed in a nice padded envelope."

37,38,20090113,B00006ANDJ,4,"January 13, 2009",ACX5JCJ893SUY,Toothbrush,"Not much to say as far as the product is concerned I have been using my Oral-B for years.But Amazon doubled my order and charged me shipping; for one set, when it was a \'free shipping\' item and yes I met the requirement for \'free Shipping\'.  I even called and talked to a customer service rep.  He said he would look into it and back to me.  Never heard back from Amazon rep.But if you have an Oral-B it\'s pretty much your only option."
40,41,20080916,B00006ANDJ,4,"September 16, 2008",AFDJGY68CQL2X,Expensive...,"...but great brushes. They really make me feel clean after I brush with them. I just wish they weren\'t so pricey, but if this means healthier teeth (my boyfriend\'s dentist knew that he had been using an electric toothbrush when he went to his check up, because it was night and day) it is probably worth the investment."

This vendor\'s price for a set of three is superb.See my other reviews for more specifics on EB17 Flexisoft (normal adult) and extra-soft (soft adult, children) heads."
47,48,20051207,B00006ANDJ,3,"December 7, 2005",A198CCH4NNLI2E,Bristles seems engineered to fail quickly,"Remember when you didn\'t need to replace your toothbrush every 12 weeks? It\'s almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money. While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year."

If you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex, your teeth suffer. The Oral B head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth, you can. I have not had a cavity in years. My pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed. If only these woked on abs."

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  This particular item is three heads.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads.  You can find them for much less than $10/head, which is the price of this listing."

The soft bristles clean your teeth and massage your gums efficiently, and the color bands are a convenient way to color-code heads for multiple users.  There\'s even a spare in case you lose one.Of course you should still floss before brushing, but the small soft brush and the speed of the rotation makes daily dental hygiene easy and painless.When I ordered this item, it was shipped by an Amazon partner, who packaged it in a HUGE box, filled with plastic packing material.  I could hardly find the small package inside the carton.High marks for the product, huge waste of packing material and postage for the packaging."

The heads go white with use to tell you when they are ready for replacement."

If you have sensitive teeth and require a truly soft brush, or if you plan to use this brush for children, I couldn\'t recommend it."
67,68,20120208,B00006ANDK,5,"February 8, 2012",A15JXXLC69K3UY,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!,These are great if you have sensitive teeth or not. I recommend them very highly and they are so reasonable in price.

When I contacted the company, they wanted me to incur the cost of returning the product. After complaining to the service rep, the company finally relented and provided me with a prepaid shipping label. After the product was returned, it took another 10 days for the company to send me the correct product. Accordingly, I would rate my overall experience as fair and I am not sure if I would order other products from this company"

Far inferior to standard brush head,"Purchased direct from Amazon - brushes appeared genuine Oral B, right down to the high price (nearly double what they were 2 years ago!).  Appropriate markings and all that.I have used all the brush head types, and thought that \'sensitive\' meant these would be gentle but still effective.  Switched to this brush head for a couple weeks.  When hubby asked for whitening toothpaste, I noticed that we were both experiencing staining, something that hasn\'t happened since we\'ve owned a power brush.  Thanks to lots of coffee and tea, I can *see* ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health.  Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth are back to normal now.I would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).  If you must use this brush, I would consider switching to the 45-second/quadrant program."

I have seen many fakes before where spelling and punctuation on the packaging is wrong.  I have used these fake heads before bought off of Ebay and they do fall apart in your mouth presenting a potential choking problem especially for kids.

I like that these are soft but they are so soft that my teeth sometimes still feel like they are \'wearing sweaters\' even after I brush them.
110,111,20110916,B00006ANDK,4,"September 16, 2011",A1RN4ES2XL44M,Definitely different from the floss head,This brush head was definitely different from the one that came with the brush (which was floss brush head)... it\'s much softer.  It\'s softer than any of the brushes that I have used so far.Only 4-stars as I am not an expert in this area.And Amazon has a great customer service.  One of the best that I have seen.

I like it as a \'break\' from the rougher cleaning.  I also have the flosser and polisher brush heads, so I use them all.  Also, it gives your gums a break from too much brushing as that can literally brush away your gums.  I highly recommend this brush and this seller as I did not see this type in the local stores."

Beware the \'generic\' replacement heads which look alike, but are usually priced lower and offer more heads for a given price. At least in my experience, the \'generics\' rotating brush head will loosen and sometimes come off completely in less than a week, AND can painfully trap part of ones cheek in the gap between the rotating and non-rotating parts!"

In my honest opinion, the sensitive toothbrushes are generally a better way to clean your teeth. The medium to stiff bristles seem too large in diameter and stiff. These type of bristles are great for scrubbing stubborn particles, but not really that great for everyday cleaning of teeth especially when you use toothpaste that has fine abrasive particles. These brushes worked well with the sensitive mode on my Oral B 5000, although I found that my teeth didn\'t feel too bad even when using the full attack mode of the electric brush.Overall: 5/5"

The next size head down is a 40.The texture is SOFT, not Medium texture, and you should optfor the SOFT, rather than the Medium; the SOFT (this one) isplently firm to do the job without mushing down and wastingyour time just going through the motions without connecting.Looking at the bristles head-on (staring at the tips of thetufts, with the plastic head in the rear), the arrangementof the tufts (the pattern) is an oval. Normally I personallydo not like such an arrangement, preferring instead a solidrectangle, so as to purchase more surface area with which toconnect to the teeth and gums. In the case of the CrossAction(manual) toothbrush\'s configuration, the lack of \'corners\' tothe brush is not noticeable, unlike other oval-shaped heads.Reason for this is two-fold (am not a tech, this is personalconjecture or observation): the outer \'rim\' or border of thebrush\'s bristles is resilient (doesn\'t give easily, no mush),AND the very tip of the brush head has a special arrangementof slightly LONGER bristles (color: solid white, no bluishindicator layer) that reach v-e-r-y effectively into netherregions of the mouth (back molars?) to route out the bugs &leftover food particles. All you need is SOFT, not Medium;should you utilize a Medium (texture rating, not size) one,you\'d gouge your gums and whatever else is in there. You\'llget enough traction and friction and devil-exorcising actionwith a SOFT CrossAction (manual) toothbrush.Do not confuse the CrossAction with the Advantage series ofOral-B manual toothbrushes; although the Advantage line hasa similar appearance (shape and combination of features), Iventure to tout the CrossAction as being superior in termsof achieving results (getting one\'s teeth and gumline cleanin the least amount of time, with the minimum of dexterity).In case you DO wish to order a single Advantage toothbrushin the same order (to compare the two brushes), go to theSearch box and either type or copy/paste the Amazon ID# forthat style, which is ASIN: B0000C4KJG. Type B0000C4KJG w/othe \'ASIN:\'. That\'ll get you to the page which concerns theSKU 086736 (full head, soft). At the time of this review ittakes two cents more to total 25 bucks, to avoid shipping.The UPC/NDC (666 barcode) number is 3-00410-60639-8 for theCrossAction 60 Soft; that\'s for ONE brush. Six-pack sleeveshave a similar but different number, but you don\'t need thatto double-check the #53 CrossAction in a retail store. Whenyou wish to hunt down our brush in the haphazardly sortedretailer\'s toothbrush rack, home in on the reddish number53, located at the extreme tip of the J-hook tab at the TOPof the individual blister package. This\'ll save you gettingfrustrated or confused when rummaging through the toothbrushrack in search of WORDS. Find Oral-B and then find the 53...Amazon saves you money (per individual toothbrush) comparedto what the stores charge (about 4 smackers each), but youcan get your mitts on a sample in a retail Rx before you doorder (in case you prefer to SEE and heft what you\'ll getas a six-count from Amazon).The two downsides are- the blister packaging is not really biodegradable (tough);- the parent company is B-I-G on animal testing (laboratoryexperiments, usually redundant, on sentient rabbit eyes...).The Oral-B CrossAction style of manual toothbrush, althoughmore expensive than shlock-brand models, is well worth themonetary outlay. The squeaky-clean satifaction will SPOILyou, and you won\'t settle for a manual toothbrush of lesserquality in the future.This brush does not include the rubber bristles along theouter edge of similar toothbrushes: they are supposed tomassage your gums, but IMHO the regular CrossAction doesenough work on both the teeth and also the gumline to actas a do-it-all toothbrush (no, it does not floss!).BTW, your dentist probably never has mentioned during allthe precious moments that you have spent together THAT THEGUMS ACT AS AN O-RING GASKET SEAL between your teeth andthe jaw-bones. Maintaining the gums (such as with a brush)preserves the GUMS, which in turn will protect your teethROOTS and jawBONES from bacteria and foreign matter. Youneglect your gums when in your prime, and you\'ll reap amess of AVOIDABLE trouble with your roots and bones later.Perhaps you might even suggest to your dentist that s/hebe more proactive in making patients AWARE of the role ofthe (silent) g-u-m-s in protecting the base of out teeth!Parting comment: sugar rots teeth, but the bone particleswithIN refined sugar are the #1 cause of various cancers.This according to avatar Sathya Sai Baba, who should know."

423,431,20050817,B0000C4KJV,4,"August 17, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one\'s teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.2.  Waxed floss is \'waxed\' to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don\'t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: \'If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away\'.I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.Jim \'Konedog\' Koenig, DDS"

They are brand name Oral B replacements. If you\'re thinking about being cheap and buying a knock off replacement please don\'t! Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the real thing. Your Oral B toothbrush was meant to be used with Oral B heads. The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand. As far as the advertised \'Pro White\', I cannot attest to that. I seem to highly doubt that just by using a different head that you\'re teeth are magically gonna become whiter.

With an \'old fashioned\' toothbrush, I always looked for the most bristles I could find so I was surprised to discover I actually prefer the smaller Oral B toothbrush head to this one!!  The simple reason is that with the smaller head (with just the cicle of bristles), I feel like I have more control and can really get around my back teeth.  This will really boil down to preference for anyone.  I\'m sure both are great at getting your teeth clean.  But for me, I am going to stick with the standard head that comes with the toothbrush."

If you can get this for a deal, its worth it!  The product is a standard tooth brush, but obviously does ALL of the work for you.  I prefer these to the single small rotating head.  Some prefer the smaller one because it moves to smaller areas.  Maybe not the best toothbrush for children, but I love it."

They are great because they prevent one from brushing too hard as compared to using a manual toothbrush. These replacement heads aren\'t expensive. Compare it to a maunual brush, which can wear out even at a faster pace. Great productHealth and Happiness,Patrick Leonardi"

593,606,20060423,B0002KHU3I,5,"April 23, 2006",A2V7EO331SFUF6,A great addition to the Braun brush head selection,"I got one of these with my last Braun replacement, a 7850DLX set. At first, this veteran user of the EB17 Flexisoft head was a bit skeptical. But after a few days use, I have a new favorite.The dual-brush head is a bit bigger than the traditional round head. The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars. But this head is great for quickie between meal cleaning, and as a bonus is pretty good at brushing off my tongue.This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure. Since EB17s usually run about $5 per head in 3-, 4-, and 6-packs, finding the EB417 about the same price is a relief. You really DO want to replace heads every few months, after the outer blue bristles fade half-way down."

I feel it does a better job of cleaning my teeth.  I like having the advantage of getting 2 types of cleaning heads while using only one toothbrush.  The size of the brush head doesn\'t bother me, though it is a little messier to use.  It\'s hard to keep your mouth closed enough to keep all that drool inside.  I just make sure I brush over the sink."

I\'ve had no problems using these the past months, I even subscribed to receive these around the time that we would need to change our brush heads.

I originally subscribed to this product at a price around 8 dollars for three.  Since then the price has risen to almost 17 dollars for the three heads.

With the flossing action brush one can feel the slim rubber tabs getting in between your teeth.  Of course this does not eliminate actual flossing but the brush does clean well.  I bought the dual clean as the brush has dual heads and thus twice the brushing area.  It does an effective job for me and it is definitely better than a manual brush.  However, I don\'t think it is quite as good as the flossing action brush which I give 5 stars thus the 4 star rating for the dual clean."

For the replacement heads, they give us the indicator bristles so we will know when they should be replaced.  This is all wonderful, right? Then why do they charge such a high price for the replacement heads?  My instinct is to use them until there is not a trace of blue left in the indicators.  The list price for a 3 pack of replacement heads is $22, and with 1/3 off, using Amazon takes some of the sting out of keeping updated - an action that Oral B should be taking!"

At the time I was 3 months pregnant - as any dentist will tell you, your oral health tends to decline during pregnancy, due to various reasons.  Already I had a lot of tartar buildup and some places to watch.  Well, immediately after my check up I started using the Sonic Complete.  I love that it times the brushing for you, 30 seconds per quadrant, so you do a thorough job.  Last week I went back to the dentist for my 6-month followup, now 9 months pregnant, and anticipating the worst - but it was the best check up I\'ve ever had.  The cleaning was a breeze - I had hardly any buildup and everything looked great.  The hygienist couldn\'t believe it, especially given my pregnancy, and agreed with me that it must be the toothbrush.  So I\'m hooked!

Upon receiving the product, it did not look anything like the original brush heads that I received with the toothbrush I bought months ago from Amazon. The primary differences were: the bristles were the wrong color(the center green was a darker translucent color instead of the opaque light green), the bristles were splayed out instead of in tight clusters, and the gray logo was much lighter. I chalked this up to maybe changes in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the first brush head I tried did not work at all. I chalked that up to manufacturing defect. The second one worked, but didn\'t quite feel right. I decided to just go with it however, and after a month the brush head became very loose. I saw the other reviews and photos and realized that I had received fake product directly from Amazon.Here is the worst part. I decided to purchase replacement heads from Walgreens retail store. I got home and realized that they were also fake product. So, then I went to Target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine. I was floored to find fake product in a retail chain store as well as at Amazon.So, TLDR buyer beware of fake product when ordering online or shopping at retail. Look at the brush heads carefully before you make your purchase. It seems like there is a major counterfeiting problem right now and it hopefully gets resolved soon."

My previous brushes (I have had a lot of them since I owned the toothbrush for many years) never had this problem, even if I used them beyond the recommended 3 months which Oral B recommends.I am now going to contact Direct Super Center and Amazon about this issue, but I have a feeling that Direct Super Center won\'t help, after reading other comments posted here.I love this toothbrush and have had comments by my dentist about just how immaculate my teeth remain, so I will definitely be purchasing more brush heads.

The alternative is to lean over the sink so that gravity will pull this flow down into the sink, not down on to yourself.  This is rather uncomfortable after about 2-3 minutes of standing in this awkward position.  The projectile saliva/toothpaste mix is an inevitability with this design - it sucks!

The fakes are also getting very hard to spot apparently, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct. You use it in a very sensitive area of your body, and it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off is similar in quality."

The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.  I bought this second one in 9/2010 while Amazon & OralB had a 50% off rebate so ended up paying only $25 for it - a definite buy at that price!

Better portability; however, because of the small diameter of the base, it doesn\'t stand upright that well (but too big to fit in any toothbrush holder slots)- Charging Base...takes up a very small footprint on sink- Price...much lower than many newer Oral-B/Sonic-care brushes- Performance...cleans extremely well, takes a week or so to get used to it.I did try it out for a day or so, too (don\'t tell the wifey!!!) and was quite pleased by the pulsing sensation and the way it made my teeth feel/look.

1508,1543,20090924,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 24, 2009",A1OZA52DFY3SHD,"Good for your teeth, better for your gums","The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great product at a pretty good price, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s perfect.I\'ve been using an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush for about 4 years now and I really like it.  The Oral-B Professionals have the circular brush head and work differently than the Pulsonic or Philips\'s Sonicare toothbrushes.  Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I\'m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.The Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  It\'s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  The brush head of the Pulsonic is a breeze to take on and off; you slide it onto the unit and then give it a quarter-twist.  The brush head locks into place.  I hate how the brush head gets stuck on my Professional model, so this is a big advantage of the Pulsonic.  The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there\'s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  When it\'s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional\'s circular head.  The Pulsonic assists in cleaning by sending out sonic pulses, similar to a jewelry sonication cleaner.  This is used to blast off debris and break up bacteria biofilms that are populating your teeth and gums.  The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  Here\'s where I feel is the key difference that should determine which type of toothbrush you should get.  I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  The Pulsonic requires you to make tiny circular motions over your teeth and assists your cleaning with the sonic vibrations.  The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don\'t get me wrong, it\'s much better than a manual toothbrush.  But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  I\'ve never had a cavity, but the dentist always complains that my gums are a little too puffy or too red.  After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  I don\'t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.The other thing I\'ll mention about the Pulsonic is the base.  The base has a small footprint size and the Pulsonic simply rests in a small hole in the base.  It\'s a bit wobbly, but it works alright.  The problem I have, however, is that there are only two spots for brush heads.  The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have their own brush head(s) it\'s an annoying inconvenience.So I think the choice is up to your specific needs.  If you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush and commonly have cavity problems, then maybe you want to go with one of the high-end Oral-B models that have a circular head.  If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I\'d recommend the Pulsonic.  I\'m not a dentist, so that\'s just my opinion.  For my needs, though, I\'ll be sticking with the Pulsonic.UPDATE:I went to the dentist recently for my standard 6-month check-up.  I\'ve never had cavity problems before, but the dentist had always warned me that my gums and gum pockets were borderline beginning to show problems.  Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  While the hygienist was cleaning my teeth she asked, \'do you use an electric toothbrush?\'  When I replied yes, she said, \'yeah, I can tell.\'  So, there ya go.  I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they\'ve been in in years.  With that, I\'ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush."

As for those who complain about it being too messy or taking too much effort to use, maybe they just don\'t want to put out any effort at all.

The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  There are no recesses to collect toothpaste, moisture etc., so it is easy to keep clean.  I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...my whole mouth.  It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone. I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \'between\' brush would be a good thing to use. The only change I would make would be to slant the head a bit to enable reaching inside surfaces.  All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...in fact it is still working. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the Sonicare, but for the money, this is the best buy. After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  AND, I do not work for Oral B.  Come on...get real paranoid people...09/10/09:  I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  I have not had this problem.  I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed and I can see where that might create the above mentioned problem.  I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  Just food for thought if trying to decide on this product.  I still love it."

After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.-----THE GIST OF IT---------I\'m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that\'s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn\'t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It\'s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn\'t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn\'t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It\'s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.-----ENDING------Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won\'t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won\'t do it.  They\'ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.Lastly, I don\'t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes."

I liked the slim design and two speed options.  The brush head looked more like a traditional manual toothbrush.  It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can\'t say that they appear whiter.  I find that the 30 second timer and two minute marker to be both helpful yet a bit annoying- its nice to know how long you\'ve been working on a section of teeth but I tend to brush longer than the recommended 2 minutes so it isn\'t broken up to my needs.Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  The Pulsonic seems a bit flimsy- like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  I also don\'t feel like the bristles get in between my teeth like the Sonicare did, either.  The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn\'t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.  I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!"

I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use. This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED. I was initially disappointed as I realized I had a brush head that didn\'t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed. URGH... I decided to give it the weekend before trying to call customer service on Monday to get a replacement. However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions. When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean! Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush (forgot what they call it) and the fact that it continues to brush past 2 minutes. The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines. And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!! And an added bonus is that the replacement heads are even less expensive and the brush it self had a $15 rebate so less than the cheapest Sonicare too.And I\'ve only had it 4-5 days now but I am certain my teeth are already whiter than they were and less stained!!"

By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations. Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.Looks and size: nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).I would recommend this product to my family and friends."

It was time to replace it because it wasn\'t holding a charge for very long. I decided to try this cheaper version and I am not sorry. It does the same job as the more expensive version and is easier to hold. It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it. Because it is lighter and thinner, I think I actually use it longer. It is also easier to find the replacement heads for it. I also think that the shape of the toothbrush makes it is easier to get at the back of the bottom teeth where the plaque is the worst. That means less time in the hygenist chair. Since using the sonic toothbrush I definitely see a decrease in the build up of plaque and that is makes this purchase worth every cent."

I like the slim design, and it seems to clean the teeth well. The problem is that the toothbrush head fell off twice during use. Maybe it is vibrating off? Also it feels a little cheapy compared to Sonic care, and the vibration is a little more rough. If you are trying to decide between the two types. Get the Sonic Care.

While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.ADVANTAGES:Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It\'s not the most powerful brush I\'ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.DISADVANTAGES:Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it\'s nice to have the option and this one does not.Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it\'s power would rate 3 stars.OTHER COMMENTS:Does it whiten teeth?  It\'s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.  I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me."
1589,1629,20080925,B001CX4JSS,3,"September 25, 2008",A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,Similiar size and weight of Sonic Flexcare,In all fairness I already use the Sonic Flexcare daily and it has a similar sonic speed feature. After a few weeks of exclusively using this toothbrush there was no noticeable whiteness difference for my teeth. It was easy to use and there were no issues with it. I chose to return to the Sonic and will keep this one as a back up. The reason for this was due to the brush head since I had already picked up a replacement pack. I really don\'t see how one could go wrong with either brand\'s lightweight sonic model. I think in choosing it will come down to which one is on sale or even color/style preference.

The first time I have tried it, it felt a bit unpleasant, but I have gotten used to it very quickly. The best thing about this brush is the bigger brush head as compared to Oral-B Triumph. The brush allows you to use twice as much toothpaste (I have always been concerned that I was not using enough toothpaste with round Oral-B brushes), and it seems that it cleans teeth faster on flat surfaces. Getting into corners requires as much effort as with any other toothbrush.What I did not like: the charger is big and you cannot remove extra brush holders; to turn it off you have to push the power button twice (the first time it switches to sensitive mode); you are supposed to use it in a circular motion, and I tend not to be very good at it. In old days I had problems with traditional toothbrushes as I used to move them up and down and ended up scratching my teeth, so I am afraid this might happen with this brush as well. Finally, the description promises whiter teeth in two weeks, but I cannot see any difference."
1600,1641,20080904,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 4, 2008",A3FXT4UPI30K7S,Absolute Must-Have Excellent Travel Size Sonic Toothbrush,"The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush far surpassed my expectations in terms of size, weight, sturdiness, quietness and functionality for a sonic toothbrush. Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week\'s time, in my case of twice daily use. While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful! Not only is this toothbrush built for home use, it\'s the one you won\'t want to be without wherever you go.I especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I\'m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds. The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who\'ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have... yet I found I can get used to the sonic sensations, and I even feel that my gums and teeth are gaining strength, cleanliness and overall health. Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.So just how compact is this toothbrush? At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one\'s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing. The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth. The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.The directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I\'ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do). Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question. This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush I don\'t want to live without!  Highly, highly recommended."

As a loyal Oral B user (Triumph 9900), I must say that my expectations were high and I was a bit disappointed by the performance of this instrument in comparison to my Triumph 9900.On the positive side is the form-factor which is fantastic, it is nearly as light weight and compact as a standard (non-electric) brush.  It is the perfect size for travel.On the negative side are the following:(1) The brush quality.  The brush quality is on-par with my earlier Oral B brush (which now retails for around $35).  Additionally, the brush head is more traditional and I tend to favor the rounded head found on most Oral B brushes.(2) The charging station.  Not nearly the high quality that I would expect.  Made from light-weight plastic, it feels cheap.(3) The price.  This product would be perfectly priced at around $45 and is a bit expensive at close to $70."

I previously used the Hydrabrush, which is very bulky and heavy with large brushes and felt uncomfortable in my mouth.  This Oral-B Pulsonic feels very comfortable in my mouth; the brush head is very small.  There are two modes, clean and sensitive, which I really like.  At first the clean mode was too strong on my teeth and I switched to the sensitive mode.  Now I\'m used to the clean mode, but use the sensitive mode behind my teeth where it\'s more gentle on my gums. It also has a very small brush head for in between teeth; somewhat like flossing. It has 30-second timers (not a beep, a hesitation) to let you know when to switch to another section of teeth if you want to.  My teeth feel very clean and tartar free after brushing.  The only reason I\'m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are NO replacement brush heads; even though it recommends replacing them every three months.  It really should include at least one set of brush heads.  All in all, a good product and I would recommend it."
1607,1649,20080828,B001CX4JSS,3,"August 28, 2008",A1VUN4JU731CBH,Not sure...,"I have pretty much had and tested them all: The Oral-B Triumph, the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, and now the Oral-B Pulsonic. Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but the Pulsonic leaves me a bit unsure.The design of this brush is very reminiscent of the Sonicare toothbrushes, right down to the stand which always looked different on all the previous Oral-B electric brushes. This design really looks like a stripped-down baby version of the Sonicare.First of, the brush itself is extremely slim and light-weight for an electric brush. So much so that one wonders whether it can actually \'do the job\'. So after charging it the required 12 hours, I tried it out for the first time. I did not find it any different in power than the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, it felt the same.What is different is that the Pulsonic\'s manual instructs the user to move the brush over the teeth in a circular motion, very much like one is supposed to do with a manual brush. I, for one, didn\'t quite like this although I can see the benefit of doing it this way. The Pulsonic has - like the Sonicare and unlike the Oral-B Triumph - a regular (yet contoured) brush head. The shape of such a brush head makes it difficult  to sufficiently cover the entire tooth. One is always either cleaning along the gumline or more towards the bite. Using circular motion prevents that only parts of the teeth are cleaned. Yet - I have been using electric toothbrushes for so long that I have gotten used to not really having to do anything but hold the brush head to the teeth. So this is a change I am not sure I like too much.Also - these rectangular brush heads don\'t seem to work too well for me personally. I have a small mouth and find it difficult to easily brush my teeth with these brush heads, especially the insides of the front teeth. It always feels as if I can\'t quite reach all the surfaces, especially the areas along the gumline, and that leaves me wondering whether I get as complete a cleaning as I should be getting.Philips has tried to address this problem by offering a smaller brush head for the Sonicare, but Oral-B doesn\'t seem to have that. So this is not optimal for me.What I did like about the Pulsonic though is that it comes with a second \'Precision Tip\' brush head. I found this to be a great way to really get into the spaces between teeth and I give Oral-B a big thumbs-up for this one.Lastly, the Pulsonic, like the other models and brands, informs the user audibly when it is time to change to a different \'quadrant\' to be brushed, and when the two minutes recommended brush time are over.All in all this is probably a brush I will take along when travelling - the light weight but equal power output make it perfect for that, but at home I will likely stay with the Oral-B Triumph and its round brush heads. I just feel that these heads reach all areas of my teeth better and also feel more comfortable on the sensitive areas of my mouth."
1609,1651,20080828,B001CX4JSS,5,"August 28, 2008",A1JAPP1CXRG57A,You Can Never Be Too Quiet or Too Thin,"If you\'re a toothbrush, that is.Compared to the Sonicare toothbrush I own, this skinny model is uber quiet, and lacks that \'dental-drill\' whirring noise. Good for those of us who don\'t like reminders of the dentist\'s office.The slim handle is the best part, because it lets you easily turn the brush, and move it from side to side in your mouth. There\'s less \'banging\' against the teeth this way, and it\'s easier to reach all tooth surfaces.Both modes, (clean and sensitive modes) get their jobs done with a minimum of noise.The brush head is a \'standard\' size, neither too big nor too small, and fits comfortably in the mouth. Replacement heads are easy to find in retail stores (not always the case with electric brushes) and are slightly less expensive than Sonicare replacement heads.Overall, this is a great little brush. And I do mean little, as in slim. :)"
1612,1654,20080827,B001CX4JSS,5,"August 27, 2008",A2X61KKXXR6WNP,A better toothbrush,"This product is Oral-B\'s answer to the Sonicare, as both of them clean teeth using ultrasonics (tiny vibrations) instead of a more standard rotating head.  Kind of like the old vibrating toothbrushes from long ago, except the power behind this is far greater, and much more effective.Sonicare had the benefit of being first with this type of brush, but Oral-B has an advantage in that they can study the other product and make improvements on it.  I\'d say the major difference is that the Oral-B is thinner, lighter, and therefore easier to hold and maneuver around the mouth.  The replacement brushes are also less expensive on this model, which is important as they can really add up if you replace them as recommended by the manufacturer, every three months or so.I was pleased to see that toothpaste can be used with it, although if you use too much you\'ll be foaming at the mouth from the ultrasonics.  It is still pretty foamy, so I recommend staying close to the sink.The recharging base is small, attractive, and wall-mountable.  The power cord plugs into a wall outlet and doesn\'t use a transformer, so it won\'t take up additional outlets. It will hold two spare brush heads behind the toothbrush, and allows the toothbrush to be dropped in facing any direction.  So, when you are done it is an easy matter to drop the toothbrush back onto its base.It actually worked quite a bit better than I expected.  The head is fairly small, so it is easy to move around your mouth to clean each tooth.  The timer lets you know if you are rushing the job (I usually am, but at least now I can\'t pretend I don\'t know that!).  The massage mode for the brush seems like a feature that I\'ll never use, but people with tender gums that are working their way up to the full speed might like it.  I use mine on clean mode all the time and it works well.  It is somewhat annoying that both modes are accessible through the single button given that I never use the lower-speed.  It isn\'t so annoying that it is a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.I was happy with the noise level, too.  Nothing bugs me more than holding something that sounds like a buzz saw so close to my ear in the morning.  Mercifully, this brush is pretty quiet, as these things go.  It is louder than a manual brush, of course, but quieter than an electric shaver.  The pitch is a little high, but nothing I can\'t live with.Overall, I like it and would get it again.

Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you\'ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn\'t work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on.

I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife\'s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you\'re used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I\'m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn\'t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I\'ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I\'m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit."

Works great, just as good as the previous generation Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush, which died after approx. 4+ years of use.  This one is about half the size of the previous generation, and equally powerful.I did own a Philips Sonic Tooth Brush about 8 years ago, but it only lasted two years before it broke.This one never seems to require a charge, after about two weeks of use I put it back on the charger out of habit.Before ordering, I figured I would give the Arm & Hammer Sonic Spin Brush a try (available at my local pharmacy for approx. $30).  The difference can be compared to a Pinto vs. a Lexus.  The Sonic Spin Brush worked okay, and probably if I had never owned a real Sonic Toothbrush, I would have kept it, but it was not the same.  The Sonic Spin Brush felt cheap and poorly implemented.  You definitely get what you pay for.Now, only time will tell if the Oral-B Pulsonic will last as long as its predecessor, so 4 stars, not 5."

This was perfect for my style.  I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.  My battery has not died yet.  My hygienist noted my gums are stronger.

The timer-mechanism is pretty cool (every 30 secs) and lets you know when to switch quadrants of your mouth.  Also notifies you after 2 minutes has spanned.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.The only slight drawback (minimal) is how you switch modes, essentially need to press the main button for toggling through them and turning the toothbrush off.

It has a 2 minute timer and every 30 seconds it changes up the vibration so you know when to switch to a different area in your mouth.  It has two settings and one is softer for gums or when you\'re just starting out using it.  It\'s not a really loud one and it doesn\'t need any batteries, it has a recharger.  I\'m able to charge it up and take it on a long weekend and it works just fine.  It comes with a smaller brush for getting along your gums.

I had her try this brush out for 2 weeks to see if she could tell the difference between the two, and she could.  She said it did not feel nearly as powerful, nor did it clean nearly as well. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the form, and feel of the toothbrush.  If you simply cannot, or do not want to spend the money on the sonicare then I might buy this toothbrush.  I contacted oral b to ask if they offer a money back guarantee, which sonicare does. Oral b said they did not offer the guarantee on this model, but only on a couple of other models.  FIGURES!  The lady was polite, but I told her I was upset that I wasted my money on their product, and I will not be buying from them in the future.  We just bought a new sonicare base and it was within 4$ of what I spent for this brush, so you can no longer argue that they are in different categories.

I really like the Oral-B because it has a small rechargeable base therefore the power of the toothbrush is consistent (unlike replacement battery units).  These replacement brush heads were a great value.  I like the \'dual clean\' since it has the revolving round bristles (on top) and the bristles that move up and down (on the bottom).  These brush heads make my teeth feel so clean that I feel like I just left the dentist office.  I particularly like that the blue bristles fade through time reminding you that it\'s time to replace the brush head (they last around 2-3 months depending on how often you brush).  No regrets buying these on-line - very competitive pricing (in fact far cheaper than retail stores) and shipping was fast.

Teeth become so much whiter as the brush action really gets your teeth extremely clean.  The wonderful thing about this is you can change the brush heads to whatever you like (flosser head, precision head, etc.).  The power is nice and strong which I love, other folks may not be so thrilled.  If you have sensitive teeth this brush is still good just do not use a toothpaste with SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) OR use a sensitive toothpaste like Sensodyne.  I have sensitive teeth and use these products together and my smile is becoming more stunning everyday.  My son loves the timer function on the brush as he no longer has to use the clock."

I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I\'m lucky enough to have a window and sill.For that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don\'t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life. And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all. The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical. But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again. I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).In my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months. Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don\'t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B."

I am very happy to have it.- It takes 2 AA rechargeable batteries. A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks. (it depends on how long your batteries hold the charge). Alkaline batteries last a month. So it is very useful for traveling.- Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken. Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.- If you want to save the environment and you don\'t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans then you don\'t like toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries. It is very hard to remove the batteries from the unit to handle them properly.- This is the least expensive electric toothbrush from Oral-B. But it performs really well.- This toothbrush uses the same refill brushes that other expensive models use. So you get similar result for much less money.Con:- This one does not have a timer. You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.- People reported that this toothbrush lasts from 1 to 2 years. Well, the most expensive (about 9 times more expensive) Oral-B electric toothbrush lasts from 3 to 5 years. If you do not care about other features the expensive ones offers, I think this has more value."

She\'s quite happy with it, and was pleased to discover that the batteries and head were both replaceable. As for my own experience with it, I prefer the Sonicare-style brush head; this one has a particularly thicker post, which combined with the odd channels in it seem to make for a fair amount of drooling while I brush. Not exactly a big deal, but certainly not what I\'d like to use for everyday brushing. Still, it\'s an excellent value for the price."

I have no problem reaching my back teeth with the smaller head of this toothbrush or angling it around to ensure a good cleaning.

It uses the same heads and oscillates almost as fast but costs a lot less. The batteries seem to last for a while but you could try using rechargeable batteries. One of the best features is the circuitry that boosts the voltage of your batteries as they age in order to keep the motor speed constant. That way you don\'t have to change batteries until they are completely dead.

Better than sonicare essence,This simple cheap battery operated oral b toothbrush cleans really well and the batteries last a long time! I bought this electric toothbrush along with a sonicare essence brush that my dentist recommended. I noticed that if I took a toothpick to my teeth after using the sonicare I could still scrape off plaque. I could find no plaque after using the oral b and my teeth felt cleaner and smoother. My sonicare now sits in the closet and I use this brush exclusively. Doesn\'t hurt the gums either nor jar the teeth with high vibrations.I noticed a few people have remarked that getting the battery cap off is difficult. The trick is to squeeze inward on the sides with some strength first and then pull off. Don\'t pull off when you are just starting to squeeze inward.

Other than the addition of the two minute timer, this looked exactly like my old brush; the sale was so good that I bought several of them.  Now I know why they were on sale!  My old brush without the timer worked just fine for several years with yearly battery changes.  After only 2 months of use, the timer function on this new brush keeps kicking in after barely 10 seconds of operation instead after 2 full minutes as stated on the package!  To do a thorough job cleaning my teeth, I have to turn the brush off and wait at least 30 seconds before turning it back on only to have the same problem reoccur after only 10 seconds or less.

Why it took so long for me to buy an electric or battery powered toothbrush is beyond me. However, I\'m glad I finally woke-up and bought this \'Oral-B Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\', I\'ll never buy another manual toothbrush again.It\'s a Great Toothbrush. Buy it, you won\'t regret it.It comes as advertized with two AA batteries, just plug them in and you\'re ready to go. It has a neat 2 minute timer, which by the way is a long time when you actually start brushing. And that\'s a good thing.I got one tiny, insignificant gripe, it\'s hard to see the (+ -) battery polarity on the side of the toothbrush after removing the battery cap. When I installed the batteries the first time it wouldn\'t start, so I had to switch the batteries around, and now I have to remember the correct installation the next time I add new batteries. It\'s nothing to lose sleep over.Speaking of battery caps, removing the batter cap may be a slight problem for those people who suffer arthritis of the hand but it\'s do-able. You have to \'squeeze hard\' the two rubber spots on the sides, at the bottom of the toothbrush to release the battery cap. With that said, that too can be a good thing, because that means the battery compartment is airtight and waterproof.The ON/OFF switch is covered in some type of rubbery, waterproof membrane and is very responsive; quick on, quick off. The brush itself has a nice weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. Has the right amount of balance as well.The handle is made of two types of materials: rubber and a very smooth plastic, there\'s enough rubber on the handle so you don\'t have to worry about it slipping from your hands, even when wet. The package doesn\'t mention anything about what type of bristle comes with this toothbrush (i.e., soft or hard bristle), however, I felt NO irritation or discomfort what-so-ever.The overall length is 8-inches; brush head length is about 2.75-inches, width of the handle is about 1.5-inches X 1-inches.There are four different styles of toothbrush refill heads available for the \'Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\':1)Oral-B \'Precision\' Clean Brush Head (which comes with this toothbrush)2)Oral-B \'Pro White\' Replacement Brush Head3)Oral-B \'Dual Action\' Premium Power Toothbrush Head4)Oral B \'Floss Action\' Brush HeadI plan on stocking up on all 4 refills.

When a dental tech recommended one, I purchased this -- the cheapest available.  Bad move!  Opening the product so as to insert two batteries was the nearest thing to impossible.  Had this been sitting in a warehouse somewhere?  The rubberized materials did not respond to pressure.  The plastic end was immobile.  Pliers didn\'t help.  I thought of using my teeth as gripper, but doubted that would be good for my dental health.  I finally pried the end off with the back of a fine-bladed knife.  The interior was not marked with the customary + or - signs for the battery placement.  It appeared that the wire springs were at one end, so I inserted batteries side-by-side pointed together.  Again, Bad move!  After replacing the end piece with difficulty, of course the appliance would not turn on.  Then I found a one sentence instruction of how to place the batteries -- on a corner of cardboard inner packaging.  Well done, Oral-B -- you hid that quite successfully!  Of course, this time removing the end piece proved impossible.  I thought of returning this piece of junk, but Amazon accepts returns unopened only & in original packaging.

I have been using the dual clean head with the Viality but this model came with the floss head and I really like it.  My teeth feel really clean afterwards and noticed less plaque build up when I rub my tongue along my teeth at the end of the day.  I did not think I would use the wireless timer and if I could of removed it from the order I would of.  But since it came in the box I did set it up and gave it a try.  I found I have been brushing longer with the timer which could be why my teeth feel cleaner after using the deep clean mode and targeting all quadrants.

I got the idea to try to replace the battery but the case has no easy way of opening and my attempt resulted in a shattered case -- it went in my batteries-to-be-recycled bag. I have an Oral-B Vitality I got cheap for under $20 over a year ago because I like to have more than one electric toothbrush (big house). However, it\'s action seemed primitive to me compared to my Sonicares, so I started shopping. Costco has a current coupon on a pair of Sonicares but I decided to look online and see what I could find out and/or buy.I decided on the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 in spite of the fact that there appears to be no rebate available for it at this time. The reasons I decided on the 5000 are several. Firstly, it appears to be not difficult to replace the battery when the time comes. The replacement batteries are easily found on ebay and several of those listings (and other YouTube videos) feature  detailed instructions on how to do the replacement. You do have to use a solder iron, but I\'ve been handy with one since I was a teenager, so no big deal. I would not buy another Sonicare if I thought it might not be possible to replace the battery.Why get the best Oral-B going in spite of the price? I am a frugal guy, extremely so, but in this instance I figure it\'s time to splurge. I have only one set of teeth. The dentist does not scare me, nor the oral surgeon, but I know that the bills can come to literally thousands of dollars. If I obsess a little on my oral hygiene, so much the better! My wallet, teeth, breathe and smile will all benefit! Oh, and my general health. Oral health is a very important part of one\'s overall health.I discovered that the extra brushes I bought for my Oral-B Vitality will work fine with my 5000, cool!The Smart Guide? Well, it\'s OK, it\'s a plus, but no biggie. The biggest advantage of it is if you use more than one mode. It shows you which brushing mode you are using, and it is possible to be in a mode you didn\'t know you were in unless you glance at the Smart Guide. This happened once to me already. I hadn\'t intended to use other than the default mode, but I\'d inadvertently pressed the mode advance button.When I got the 5000, it had no charge and I set it in the charging cradle but nothing happened and I thought maybe the battery was bad. I\'d looked at the instructions on charging but hadn\'t read down to the short paragraph where it says that the battery icon on the handle\'s LCD may not appear for 10-15 minutes the first time you charge it. I still hadn\'t seen that part of the instructions when I got the idea to place the handle in the charging cradle of my Sonicare brush, thinking the Oral-B\'s might be inoperative. Just a second or two in that cradle gave the battery enough oomph to show the battery icon, I then charged it fully in the Oral-B\'s cradle and everything\'s been fine since.The Sonicares I had would pulse briefly every 30 seconds and turn off after 2 minutes. The Oral-B does the every-30-second pulsing, but keeps on going when the 2 minutes is up. I like the fact that the Oral-B keeps on going and lets me decide when I want to turn it off.I picked up mine off ebay for about $12 less than the lowest price I\'ve seen here. The price here has varied by about $10 (i.e. 10%) just over the last week. If I were in no hurry I\'d have waited for another 50% off rebate offer, however.You have to insert the brush in your mouth before turning it on so as not to spray toothpaste all over.  Likewise, you have to turn it off before removing it from your mouth. After doing that, I place it under running tap water, and while holding it under the stream of water I turn on the brush for a few seconds and let it clean itself of toothpaste, then turn off the tap leaving the brush running for a few more seconds to let it shake off most of the water so it will dry quickly.I\'ve always brushed before flossing. I always use a dental pick as well (strongly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist, it\'s the end of a round toothpick, held in a handle called the \'perio-aid 3\', given me by my dentist). A couple of days ago I started wondering if I should really brush first and did an Internet search on the subject and found out that brushing is recommended to come last because dislodging plaque from the tooth/gum-line gives your fluoride toothpaste access to the tooth surfaces, re-mineralizing those surfaces, making them more resistant to decay. So, now I\'m brushing last."

Another feature I like is the pulsing every 30 seconds.  It is supposed to be for those who divide their brushing between 4 sections of the mouth, upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. Since I like to do the back side of my front teeth together, instead I took the first 30 second pulse as, \'Ok, you\'re halfway through the top,\' and the second as a cue to move to the bottom.It\'s amazing, how much I had to force myself to stay on the top a full minute.  I didn\'t even realize I was brushing the lower teeth more.  I recently had a cleaning where I was told my upper back teeth had more plaque than lower. Now I know why!This will keep you even in your brushing time throughout your mouth, feel great, give you a terrific clean, yet be gentle.I was SO pleased that I got one for my hubby.  We have separate bathrooms, or could have easily shared the handle.  He didn\'t do the full two minutes on our old version, but on this one he is.  I think it is the continual prompts that make the brushing time seem faster.  Very impressed. So glad we got them!"

My first thought...you just want me to buy a $100+ toothbrush that works just as well as my one at home. Of course, like a fish attracted by something shiny I hopped on the internet to take a look at electric toothbrushes. I probably spent 5 hours reading everything I could on these. A lot of people were talking about the one that has a UV cleaner in it. I call gimmick. Anyways, I ended up with this one and was extremely skeptical.1. The timer is separate from the brush and sits on your counter and has a picture of a smiling tooth on it, kind of hard not to feel like this is a joke2. What the heck, charged this puppy up and waited till after dinner3. Initiate brushing sequence4. Having the handle buzz after 30 seconds to let you know to move to a new quadrant and having it show on the timer is very useful. It makes it seem like it is going by really fast.5. If you brush too hard the handle stops pulsating till you back off. I literally put the brush head on each tooth and just move down, not really doing any real brushing but just letting the vibrations do the work.6. After I spit and rinsed out my mouth, it literally felt like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. They stay smooth almost the entire day depending on what you eat.This was $$$ well spent in my opinion. I highly recommend getting one of these. Don\'t forget, you are supposed to change your brush head every 3 months or so. Might want to price that into your purchase."

I like to take 2.5 minutes versus the 2 minutes it suggests.The brush head has a more varied profile and seems to get in places the old one didn\'t.

Also, I like that it warns you if you are pushing too hard.  I got it, in part, because my dentist said I was brushing too hard.  You just barely hold on to this and let it do all of the work.  It also warns you if you are pressing too hard.3. It comes with a very handy travel case, so you could travel with it and two different heads.4. The charger base and extra head organizer if a nice touch.Cons:1. I wish it would remember the last mode you use and start in that mode.  I use the gentle mode most often, and I wish I didn\'t have to hit the mode button each time I start it to get to that mode.  That being said, it\'s very simple to do and a habit not.

We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist\'s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn\'t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn\'t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don\'t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn\'t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth."

Net cost was about $55 which is about + price of the additional brush heads.There is no comparison between this and our old model.  It is quiet and has some cool features.  There is a visible battery (fuel) gage on the handle, and a transmitter to communicate with a seperate remote unit.  This thing times you, is a clock, and even blinks if you brush too hard. The travel case is well constructed and useful. Buy one...rebate took about 2 weeks...mine was a $55 check.PROS:  quiet- cool features- teeth feel like you just had a cleaning...squeek and all- noticed definate whitening almost immediately- find myself brushing more often by choice, angled position allows makes getting to back teeth a non-issue. We love it and highly recommend it.Check out the polishing heads which have a yellow rubber center. It saves the outer bristles and you still get more than adequate flossing and unbelievable plaque removal. It really extends head life especially if you brush hard, like my wife. Trust me on this; I smoke cigars.NEGATIVES:  Really none..somewhat pricey heads, but more gental than even soft hand brushes."

I\'ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don\'t use the stand that it came with but it\'s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn\'t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I\'ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.

I have not always had good brushing/flossing habits but this toothbrush makes me want to brush. It leaves my teeth feeling polished every day just like after leaving the dentist\'s office. At night I set it on the 3 minute deep clean setting which then makes me want to follow up with flossing to get maximum clean! I\'m sure I have never spent 3 minutes brushing my teeth prior to having the wireless timer that comes in the box. The handle feels very substantial in my hand, runs very smoothly, and holds its charge for several days. I previously had the cheaply made $30 Oral-B unit and I disliked using it so much that I\'m sure I hurried to finish and did not clean my teeth very well. It vibrated too much and the brush head was way too small. The SmartSeries 5000 is a joy to use. Now I can\'t wait for my next dental checkup because my hygienist will be very pleased with how my teeth look, as am I! I am very happy to finally have made this investment in my oral and overall health!"

Flat out the best toothbrush I\'ve ever owned and worth every penny.  My dentist and periodontist agreed that my teeth and gums now are the best that they have been in my life.  I had been on a regular gum check and deep cleaning for years, and it is now removed--and the only big change I made was this toothbrush.  It is excellent with the gum cleaning (I alternate between the Floss Action a the Precision Clean heads).  Unlike previous Oral B\'s I\'ve owned, I like that this one does not reset the timer when you turn it off for a few seconds (in order to clear the foam and toothpaste!).  The charger is much smaller than previous Oral B stands. I agree with the previous review about the \'Smart Guide.\'  I didn\'t order this one specifically for the smart guide, but it came with it for only a little more.  It works great as a bathroom clock, and it helps me balance the quadrants and notes when I\'m pressing too hard).Absolutely no comparison and while it may seem expensive, it is WELL worth it!"

The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare\'s."

I got a set of sensitive heads because I have sensitive gums and never tried the other heads.  I like the sensitive heads.  Between flossing and brushing with this thing, my teeth feel almost as clean as walking out of a dentist office.  I used to see plaque build-up between visits behind my lower incisors.  This brush manages to clean that plaque away.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  In the past, I\'d occasionally see bleeding gums while flossing.  I haven\'t seen that recently.The toothbrush felt funny to use at first.  My teeth felt like they were \'buzzing\' a little after brushing.  I don\'t notice that any more.  The handle feels bulky, but I\'m able to maneuver it fine now and I can certainly clean more tooth surfaces with this brush than my old non-electric brush.  What\'s nice is that you simply have to position the brush properly and it vibrates to perform the cleaning.  I like the wireless timer that guides me through brushing 30 seconds in each quadrant.Set-up could have been easier.  Instructions were so-so and removing the back cover of the clock/timer was more difficult than it should have been.  But, day-to-day use is easy and rewarding.After using for 6 months, the wireless display became very finicky over batteries.  It goes haywire if the battery isn\'t fully charged.  The first set of batteries lasted 6 months.  I replaced with fresh energizers; they lasted only two months.  I checked the energizers with my multimeter and they register solidly in the \'good\' range---the batteries are fine."

We\'ve used Oral-B sonic for 5 years, and 5000 for 1 year.Cleanness (draw):- Both cleans well. However, they cannot remove 100% dirt from the teeth, given they use two different ways to clean. (5000 is left-right, and Sonic is up-down). It really depends on where the dirt is hiding. I would say Sonic does a better job to clean the front teeth, and 5000 does a better to job to clean the teeth in the back.Power (5000):- 5000 wins. However, it may take 1 week for your body to adjust to the strong power.Timer (5000):- 5000 comes with a timer, which is very nice.Brush head design (Sonic):- We found that the brush of 5000 wears out much faster than Sonic. I guess it has something to do with the strong power of 5000.- One thing I hate about 5000 is the brush head design. There is a hole below the brush head, which capture the toothpaste when brushing. You cannot remove it without removing the brush head. If you leave the tooth brush standing, the toothpaste inside will get out, and eventually accumulate at the bottom of the brush. This creates a round mark in our sink. To solve this problem, we need to remove the brush head and clean it completely. We didn\'t have this problem with Sonic.Battery power (Sonic)- We don\'t charge the brush until the power is completely drained. Normally, the battery of Sonic lasts about 7 days, while 5000 lasts about 3-4 days. However, it takes about 18 hours to charge Sonic, while it takes less than 12 hours to charge 5000Other uses (Sonic)- We like to use the brush head to clean the tongue. Sonic wins.Overall, we like the Sonic better."

It takes minimum 14-16 hours to re-charge it and it doesn\'t even last for more than 3 days. I had a sonicare toothbrush before and battery lasted for 15 days and got charged within 6 hours.

I just love it. It was easy to set up even for me not a gadget freak. It has a timer and action in the brush to let you know when to stop brushing. The brush heads will set you back, but you can find them on sale as well as cheaper generic versions. One caution, do not use an electric toothbrush more than twice a day and do not use much over the recommended two minutes otherwise you risk scratching the enamel on your teeth, not a good thing to do.

The smart guide lets you now when you are brushing too hard (which has aways been my problem) and has 5 different modes from sensitive, daily, massage and a 3:00 minute deep clean. It tells you when to move to each quadrant of your mouth and also when you are done, it vibrates thrice so you don\'t have to look at the screen. All in all, great product minus the bulkiness of the brush. Very happy and well worth the money!"

I had one in a drawer that cost under $20 that I never used because it was heavy and loud so I always thought I would stick to a manual toothbrush, much to the consternation of my dentist.  After reading a few reviews and talking to my hygenist I decided on the Oral-B 5000 and love it!  At first it seemed like way too much technology for something so basic, but after the short read through the manual and letting it charge I was ready to go and it only took a few uses to get the hang of.  The manual was very easy to read and understand and didn\'t really take that long to review.  Another reason that I decided on the Oral-B was because of the smaller head of the brush.  A friend of mine with another brand toothbrush said that she wishes that she had thought of that when she purchased hers.  It really is a great toothbrush and I do really feel that it deep cleans.  My only complaint about the toothbrush is that it is sort of loud, but on the sensitive setting it isn\'t too bad.  But if you need help waking up in the morning...maybe the noise will help!  Overall I really do love it and see it as a good investment into my oral hygiene."

Now like I said, I\'ve never used one before, so maybe they\'re all loud.  When I say it\'s really big I mean the base part of the toothbrush that you hold on to.  It\'s very thick/wide and is weird when holding in your hand.  My in-laws have electric toothbrushes that are much thinner, but I don\'t think they\'re as high-end as these.I\'m wondering if the additional thickness is from a better battery in this model because the battery lasts quite a while before you have to recharge it.Overall, I think this toothbrush is very good for even the normal price.

2241,2293,20101207,B002HWS9GG,4,"December 7, 2010",A29CI3E30LPLJ2,"Very good quality product, some design flaws","I recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush for my wife and I.  Overall, we are both very satisfied with this product.Product Details and background for my review--------------------------------------------I have owned Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  I have owned a previous generation of Oral-B electric brush some years ago and found the build quality was poor when compared to Sonicare. Sonicare employs a rapid vibration of the brush head to generate sonic waves which dislodge plaque from teeth.  The Oral-B brush has a small, round head that rotates back and forth (It does not do full rotations.  If I had to guess about how much it rotates before it switches directions, I would guess somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees).  The package says that in clinical studies it improves gum health better than Sonicare advance.  I cannot provide feedback on this as I have not been to the dentist since I have been using the Oral-B and even if I had been, the results of that visit would not be guaranteed to be related to the brush itself.THE GOOD--------This toothbrush is very well constructed.  This new model has excellent build quality throughout.My teeth feel smoother after using the Oral-B than after using my Sonicare.  I thought I was imagining it and didn\'t mention it to my wife but when she approached me telling me her teeth feel cleaner and smoother, I was convinced that the mechanical performance of the brush was better at cleaning the teeth.  So far the battery performance is very good but it is a new brush so I expect it to be so.  It has a pacing mode similar to Sonicare\'s in that it gives the user feedback every 30 seconds (the brush head stops moving momentarily.  Sonicare beeps in this case, but I don\'t think this is a plus or minus for either brush).  I did like that the Oral-B will let you go beyond the 2 minutes (30 seconds for each quadrant of the mouth).  The Sonicare makes you start it again as it shuts off after 2 minutes.  I brush my teeth for 2 minutes and then brush my tongue so I find the fact that the Oral-B continues to run after 2 minutes is a plus.  The brush heads are cheaper than Sonicare and they have different kinds (basic cleaning, floss action -- which has little rubber floss picks in the head).  This brush gives you feedback when you press too hard.  My Sonicare Elite does not do this.  Cleanup is \'slightly\' more difficult with the Oral-B but the way the head connects is better making overall cleanup much better.  The Sonicare has a deep plastic well that houses the magnets that cause the pulsing.  Liquids (water, saliva, toothpaste) can get in there and it is not easy to get it out fully, even with a Q-tip.  Over time, this can cause mildew, so I have had to use a q-tip in alcohol to solve this.  The way the Oral-B is designed, this would never happen, you just remove the head, rinse it and give the brush a quick wipe on a towel.  The design is very good and supports easy cleanup.  I hesitate to put the wireless remote brush monitor in the \'Good\' category, as I don\'t like it, but some people who are really gadget-heads might enjoy this.  Basically it is a small LCD display that shows you where you are in the brushing cycle and gives you a visual cue when you\'re brushing too hard.  The brush itself gives you this feedback though, so I think this wireless thing is kind of \'hokey\' and when the batteries die, I\'ll likely toss it in the box and throw it under the stairs.  The good thing about it is that both my wife\'s brush and mine connect to a single wireless display without \'pairing\'.  I haven\'t tried to use it at the exact same time as her, but this obviously would not work.  It has tiny integrated legs so that you can lay it down on its side without it rolling away.THE BAD-------There is a \'mode\' button that lets you cycle through the five brushing modes.  It is right where I naturally want to put my thumb so I have had to train myself to put my thumb elsewhere so I don\'t keep changing modes while I brush.  It is much louder than my Sonicare  The Sonicare works by a magnet turning on and off rapidly so there is no connection between the brush head and the \'motor\'... In the Oral-B, there is basically a tiny axle that connects the motor to the brush head.  This is inherently noisier than the Sonicare design.  I don\'t find it terrible though.  I do not find the wireless lcd display to be useful.  Everything it provides can (and is) provided by feedback in the toothbrush itself.  The wireless lcd display is just another thing to clutter your bathroom vanity.  With that said, the pricing does not make it feel as if I paid extra for the lcd display so I am not too concerned about it.THE UGLY--------Nothing about this toothbrush was terribleOther things to considerThe brush has various modes (high speed, lower speed, one that slowly goes from gentle to vigorous and back, one that pulses, etc.  I believe there are 5 such modes).  I do not use them because my gums and teeth are not sensitive so I use the vigorous mode full-time but maybe somebody with sensitive gums would want the pulsing mode so they could have some gum stimulation without over-doing it."

I also bought the sensitive one, which I use most often. Overall, I am very happy with it. It does a great job cleaning. I like the little display unit that tracks the time of brushing. The only downside is that I have to charge it pretty often. It lasts for about a week before it needs to be charged again. Besides that I think that it is a great product. The best toothbrush I have had so far."
2248,2300,20101202,B002HWS9GG,4,"December 2, 2010",A3RZXOS53C9JW3,Upgrade from alkaline battery operated Sonicare,The Oral-B is a great toothbrush that gives more options than necessary. Let me just start off by mentioning why I rated this product 4 instead of 5 stars. All of the different setting on the brush seem fairly pointless so I think it it would be easy to downgrade to another Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series Toothbrush without the \'massaging\' \'whitening\' or \'deep clean\' settings. So this isn\'t really a negative aspect of the product but something that the consumer is paying for and doesn\'t seem to be getting any extra benefit. Save yourself the extra cash and just get one of the more basic models; I only use the daily clean setting.Since using the Oral-B I do believe that my teeth gave become more white and have a greater overall brush experience. I think this has much to do with the included \'Pro-White\' head that is included along with the \'Floss Action\' head. The rubber cup on the head really wipes away plaque and buildup. I can\'t really say that the \'Floss Action\' head is all that the name seems to claim but it does seem to be a great everyday head to use when accompanied with daily flossing.Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Oral-B Professional Care Series to anyone looking to take great care of their teeth.

In the early 80s I had gum surgery because of it. I\'m supposed to go to the dentist every four months for a cleaning, but of course I don\'t go to the dentist near that often; maybe once a year if I\'m lucky. Anyway I always have a large plaque buildup when I finally do go to the dentist for a cleaning. The last several times I\'ve gone to the University of Pittsburgh school of dentistry where dental hygiene students do the work and the instructors check their work and correct the cleaning if necessary. Anyway I\'ve never had better cleanings in my life, but I still get severe plaque between cleanings. The last time I went the instructor recommended the Oral B 5000 toothbrush for my plaque problem. I thought I\'d give it a try and to say I\'m pleased is an understatement. I\'ve been using it now for five weeks after my last cleaning and as of yet I can feel no plaque buildup on my teeth. In the past by this time after a cleaning the plaque was starting to form when I used a regular toothbrush. I use the included timer and clean my teeth for a total of about 2 1/2 minutes. The feature I like is that you can get the molars clean. This was always a problem area for me in the past. Also the toothbrush will slowdown or stop if you press too hard. After a week or so you know what kind of pressure to apply and hone your cleaning technique. I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has a plaque or gum problem. One final note; I don\'t keep the charger plugged in all the time. I charge the toothbrush and can use it for eight or nine days before recharging. I\'m old school on this and feel the battery will last much longer if not charging all the time. I might be wrong on this, but I know at the very least it won\'t hurt battery life."

My teeth whitened a little bit at first and the overall health of my mouth improved greatly.  I will never switch back to a traditional toothbrush, even though it\'s costlier for this one and the refills.  I figure I\'ll save much more than that in the long run and just the way my mouth feels now makes it worth the cost.  The box comes with everything you\'ll need.  It had two brush heads included, a traveling case and an okay looking case for the brush heads (I still prefer to keep them in my medicine cabinet).

I don\'t know if newer Sonicare toothbrushes have a different design. I used the Sonicare Elite for many years until the nickel-cadmium battery died. I didn\'t notice the inferior design of the Sonicare until I started using the Oral-B 5000. The Sonicare has fat plastic at the brush end which is not as comfortable as the slim Oral-B brush head. The Sonicare has a fat and elaborate interface between the base and the removable brushing unit, which is not as easy to keep clean as the slim and simple interface of the Oral-B. And the Oral-B brushing part of the two types of brush included in the box does a better cleaning job. Finally, we have battery disposal. The Sonicare has a non-removable Ni-Cad battery, so that in order to dispose of it properly at a recycling center I had to cut the base to access the battery. The Oral-B has a provision for removing the nickel-metal hydride battery (better than Ni-Cad), although the manufacturer wants you to stop using the unit when the battery dies, not to replace it."

I just received my rebate check for $105.00!  The toothbrush is great and comes with two brush heads (whitening and flossing).  It was easy to set up the clock/timer and sync it with not only one brush but both brushes.  The travel case is handy as well as the toothbrush charger, although I wish the plug didn\'t stick out so far from the wall.  The battery lasts at least two weeks without a charge and the replacement heads are less expensive than a Sonic Care.  I\'ve been using the toothbrush for a two months and I\'m pleased with it\'s performance.Pros: Cost, Easy to use, timer keeps track of quadrant brushing so you don\'t have to, cost of replacement headsCons: Plug is bulky"

My mother spent a lot of money on me as a child; she paid for me to have braces two different times. I always want to have good teeth for aesthetic reasons, and also because my mom invested so much in my teeth even though paying for braces twice wasn\'t so easy for her. I figure it\'s the least I can do, considering what she did for me.I have been wanting a rechargeable toothbrush for a long time, and I wanted the best I could buy in the Oral B line. I kind of thought that $100 was pretty high for a toothbrush, but they are offering the 50% rebate right now. When I get the rebate check, I\'ll really only have $50 in it. And that\'s not a bad price for a product that helps you keep your mouth healthier. I would have eventually bought this toothbrush at full price without a rebate, but the 50% rebate really pushed me to go ahead and buy it now.I got my toothbrush about 4 days ago, and I absolutely love it so far. I feel like it does a much better job than a manual toothbrush ever could. I\'ve been brushing in the Deep Clean mode, which is 3 minutes. Sometimes I even continue brushing for a minute or two after the 3 minutes on the Smart Guide has passed. My teeth feel so smooth when I\'m finished brushing; it\'s amazing.I love the Smart Guide that comes with this toothbrush. The timer really helps you see how long to brush in each quadrant before moving on to the next. I feel like I\'m getting a professional cleaning at home.I read a lot of reviews on here before making my purchase, which was very helpful. I did read a few reviews where people had said they experienced some bleeding from their gums, but I haven\'t had any trouble with that at all.So far, I\'m thrilled with this toothbrush and hope it continues to impress me. My twice yearly dental cleanings/checkups are always great, but I\'m really anxious for my next visit to see if the hygienist notices less plaque buildup, etc.If you\'re thinking about a rechargeable toothbrush, this is an excellent choice. The rebate right now can\'t be beat either!"

Two minutes go by in a flash and my teeth feel clean, even cleaner than some cleanings I have had in the dentist\'s office.The timer was very difficult to open.  There are two pieces of plastic covering the battery. Instead of sliding the top cover one has to press and raise it off the appliance.  (If this sounds confusing, it is.)  The second cover slides off.All things considered, I think I will be very happy with this toothbrush.  Did a lot of research before I bought it because the last electric toothbrush I had left a lot to be desired.  This is a winner.UPDATE:  I\'ve had this toothbrush for 6 months.  3.31.11 I noticed a yellow, sticky residue on the charger that appears to be oozing from the bottom of the handle.

The brush itself is much nicer than my old Oral-B 3D...there\'s much more to it and fits your hand perfectly.

Those were the two top reasons why I purchased this product.  I knew I wanted to purchase an Oral-B.  I ordered the Oral-B 5000 Sunday 9-20, it was shipped 9-21 and I recieved it 9-25.  The order came from TeethNthings.  The product was packed ok but I received it banged up.  The postal worker wanted to blame it on poor packaging but it was packaged fine.  The product itself was fine.I have been using this product for a couple of days now so I must report that I am overall very happy and satisfied with it.  I read over the instructions twice, and when I used it for the first time, I was puzzled when I felt it doing small pauses.  The instructions are ok.  They could have broken it down dummy-style for some of us but oh well.  I was a bit confused about how to set the timing part, but I figured it out.  It could have been the excitement.If you buy this product, it will do these short pulses every two minutes.  After two minutes of brushing, the smiley comes up and winks.  So cute.  If you reach 4 minutes of brushing, it will do the pulse thing again.  There is a DVD that comes with it to explain their brushing technique of using the brush.  They break it down in 4 quadrants, 30 second intervals, two get in at least 2 minutes of brushing.The toothbrush itself is a tad bit noisier and heavier than my old ancient basic one, but let me tell you, boy does it go.  I feel like my teeth are getting a serious dental treatment, Spa Dente\'.  I don\'t know what this toothbrush will leave for the dentist to do, besides exrays.  To switch between the different brushing styles, you will push the triangle button while the brush is on.  The detached screen thing will tell you.  I use it in sensitive mode.  If you are brushing too hard, it will flash red.  Be careful not to push it while brushing, as it would seem easy to do.I really really love how they have the charger.

Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don\'t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don\'t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don\'t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.  I\'ll figure it out."

But lately, I\'ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \'bristles\' and how they\'d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I\'d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I\'ll be certain to purchase this model again.

I plan to have my two young children use the brush, however, the brushes are identical, with no markings to distinguish them, so I marked one brush at the base with a permanent marker to indicate the difference.  The brushing action is robust and does a good job of scrubbing tooth surfaces.  There is no need for additional pressure or manual brush strokes.  The brush has a built-in timer and makes a stuttering sound after you have brushed for two minutes.  My kids enjoy the brush and don\'t find it overly harsh or difficult to use.  I was quite pleased with the results and feel it does a better job than relying on them to properly use the manual brush.  The two-minute timer also makes sure they brush for a sufficient duration.  We\'re approaching two weeks of use without a recharge.  That\'s pretty good battery life, considering it\'s used twice a day by two people.

It\'s just one rotating head, whereas the SpinBrush has a rotating head and another section that goes up and down.  While I thought the rotation wouldn\'t leave my mouth feeling as clean as the double-motion head of the SpinBrush, it actually felt better!  Perhaps the smaller head allows it to get to more places in my mouth, or perhaps it is that the rotation looks, sounds, and feels much faster.  The SpinBrush is battery powered and even with new batteries, I don\'t think the top head spun as fast as this bad boy.  While this toothbrush costs more than the SprinBrush, it\'s still relatively inexpensive and since you can replace the heads, it\'s still a good option for those who don\'t want to spend top dollar on an electric toothbrush.

I\'m also concerned that some of the power brushes are too powerful - my teeth get sensitive. After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I\'ve been doing pretty well with the cheap Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary). Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.It\'s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it\'s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn\'t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that\'s it. I think that when the battery dies it\'s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn\'t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don\'t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn\'t a concern for me. I\'m planning to buy this brush for my children to try.

If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It\'s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one\'s teeth during brushing.I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one\'s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.So, it\'s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs."

I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn\'t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 & 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I\'m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn\'t expecting that big of a difference.The only thing I don\'t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn\'t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn\'t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.

I had always been concerned about electric brushes being complicated and not much of an improvement over their manual cousin, however, my fears were quickly allayed as I found the Oral-b 3000 to be a fast and easy setup.  I also wasn\'t prepared for the kind of clean a electric brush would bring over a manual.  My teeth feel much cleaner and I even find myself looking forward to brushing now.

Once I got over feeling like I was brushing my teeth with a swirling brillo pad (a sonic toothbrush head doesn\'t rotate, it just kinda vibrates). I discovered what I have been missing! I brush too hard. There is a light on the back of the toothbrush (so you can see it in a mirror) that comes on when you apply too much pressure. The next thing I discovered was how clean my teeth felt! The Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing plaque between teeth (better than a sonic brush). My mouth is cleaner, my breath fresher, my teeth brighter and I have a happier smile since I switched to Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush!"
2658,2723,20100916,B003UKKHB4,5,"September 16, 2010",A2701UXI8QGRHE,I cannot wait for my dentist to see my teeth!,"I figure that I am like most people when it comes to my teeth.  I brush and floss at least once a day, maybe two if I have time.  Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.Then this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information - you find out that the brush tells you how to time your brushing.  It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  Yes, and further, the brush signals you to change.Quick reminder, after you put the toothpaste on your brush, press it to your teeth before turning it on, otherwise you get to spend some time cleaning toothpaste off the bathroom mirror, walls, and perhaps ceiling.  One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over the entire area - front, bottom, back, and gumline.  After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.  I was impressed.After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  I rinsed, and looked in the mirror.  To my surprise, I could already see a change in my teeth.  It was slight, but noticeable to me.  After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost."
2662,2728,20100915,B003UKKHB4,3,"September 15, 2010",AHFGCH8LANEZK,Oral-b vs. Sonicare,"I am a nut when it comes to dental care.  I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  I floss daily and have used a Sonicare electric brush for close to 15 years.  It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  That was a bit much for me.  And my teeth weren\'t that bad, it\'s just that he was very fastidious.  I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  And I ALWAYS swish my mouth out with water after eating or drinking anything.Anyway, when I got the chance to try this Oral-b, of course I was up for the challenge.  When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the other.After trying the Oral-b for a week, I can tell you that I am definitely a Sonicare person.  Here is the breakdown of my experience:Oral-b pros:*Handle feels nice in hand.  It has a silicone/rubbery grip that is ergononimic*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.Oral-b cons:*Way too noisy.  I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  Not a relaxing experience, I felt too stressed with all of the noise, lights, and buzzing.*The depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush head.*It does not stop after 2 minutes of brushing.  I am used to the way the Sonicare handle stops working after you\'ve hit the 2 minute mark.  With the Sonicare if I want to keep brushing after the 2 minutes, I just press the button again.  With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn\'t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  Next bullet point.*Loud humming with surge pulse.  This is Oral-b\'s answer to Sonicare\'s quadrant pacer, where it nudges you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn\'t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!*Single button control. It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.*Cleanliness?  I didn\'t feel like my teeth were any cleaner than they already were when I used my Sonicare.I still believe that liking the Oral-b or Sonicare is a matter of personal preference.  Cost analysis-wise, the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  But I prefer the Sonicare."

I am a bit taken back by the sensation of the whirling brush head, but I have to say that my teeth feel much cleaner than they did with manual brushing.The red light that indicates too much pressure is a good thing for me, since my dentist has said that it appears I brush my teeth too hard. (Edit: The red light now flashes randomly whenever the brush is on. I\'ve used this for less than a week and it\'s broken already.)I am, however, extremely surprised that at this price you only get one brush head, and that the battery is not replaceable (all rechargeable batteries have a limited life span).I can\'t promise you that it is worth 2x to 4x the price of some of the other powered toothbrushes you can buy, but I do like the extra-clean feeling I get with it."

I\'d been considering trying out an electric toothbrush for a couple years now, after issues with gingivitis. However, the expense of a unit deterred me from purchasing one. The Oral-b 3000 is a sturdy unit, easy to use, and in a word of a novice user, quite a bizarre experience.To move from manually brushing your teeth to an electric brush requires a period of adjustment. The unit is very easy to use, and comes with features that make decisions about brushing teeth easier. For example, the unit recommends brushing each side of the mouth for thirty seconds; thirty seconds for upper left, thirty seconds for lower left. The unit actually pulsates at you when its time to switch, so little thought is required.Another feature I appreciate is that if you apply too much pressure to the brush, the unit will let you know by slowing down. It\'s a feature designed to protect the tooth from hard waring action. I do appreciate that.The bizarreness of the experience is the actual brushing. The sensation of whirring against my teeth immediately transported myself to my dentist\'s chair (never a pleasant time, in my opinion). Perhaps it was the sound as well. The sensation of a pulsating unit in my mouth brought up images of drills, and cavities; not all together pleasant.One drawback is already mentioned in another review. When the unit\'s rechargable batteries die, so do the unit. I\'m not sure how long they will last, but I would have to ask myself, would I spend money on another electric toothbrush when this one dies? At this point I cannot say for sure. I need to give the unit time to see if it is effective, and I\'ll know more from my dental hygeinist after my next dental appointment."

Clearly they got the source of the stain wrong, and I\'m not so sure about the brush.My research led to the purchase of the Oral-B 3000.Oral-B and Sonicare seem the brushes of choice, and my research gave Oral-B a slight edge, though I\'m reconsidering. Reading reviews also gave the Oral-B floss action brush head a slight edge, and I\'m inclined to agree; though it certainly doesn\'t replace regular flossing, so far it seems to be keeping the staining abated.The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist\'s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. Primarily, the mode switch is a source of frustration, for the brush can not be shut off without going through all three modes. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000."

It\'s definitely not like the Sonic and doesn\'t tolerate much pressure at all - making it difficult in tight spots as it just stops if it thinks there is too much pressure being applied when it isn\'t always about the pressure.

After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can\'t see because it\'s inside the column. It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next day.The directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable. I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000% markup.I tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.Caveat emptor."

Oral-B also makes the 1000 series model.  There\'s nothing wrong with this I am sure, however I believe it doesn\'t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  The only downfall is that about once a week you do have to charge the battery (which does take about 17 hours).  Honestly, that\'s not a big deal.  The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  It has room for additional brush heads.  It\'s a nice feature, but something I really don\'t find the need for.  Overall, those are minor things.  I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains."

My hygieneist recommended the Oral B a while back and I took her advice.why I like my Oral B better:1- The heads are small and round like the dentist\'s equipment. It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than \'brushing\' like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).2- It\'s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.3- If it pops out of your mouth while it\'s running, it doesn\'t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.4- It doesn\'t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever? I was told my gums are in much better shape than before.6- It\'s cheaper.  \'nough said."

Thought I could get a sonicare like my sis, but it was so much more expensive and seems to be a bit high maintenance. Tried the Oral-B Vitality with the floss action brush head and it was amazing!

Only negative is that there is no low battery warning so it will die in the middle of a brushing episode if you don\'t regularly plug in the charger-stand.

Unfortunately, I think the Sonicare experience set the bar too high and the Oral-b toothbrush did not meet my expectations.Oral-b features I liked:-Lightweight (lighter than the Sonicare)-Compact head-Bristles rotate and get in between teeth fairly well, but seem a little harsh along the gum line-InexpensiveHere\'s how the Sonicare one is better than the Oral-b one:-The Sonicare has a slimmer brush head \'neck\' between the bristles and the base/handle; the Oral-b one feels awkward because it\'s thicker-Sonicare has adjustable timing in 30 second increments up to 3 minutes, with auto shut-off; Oral-b has an alert that goes off at 2 minutes, but it doesn\'t turn off and it\'s not adjustable-The Sonicare brush/bristles have a plastic cover for when toothbrush is not in use; Oral-b just stays exposed when not in use, much like a regular toothbrush-The Oral-b toothbrush is louder than the Sonicare toothbrushOverall, I felt like my teeth were very clean, except along the gum line where I was hesitant to direct the Oral-b brush since it\'s a little harsher than my Sonicare (and I have sensitive gums already).

It takes a little getting used to, but it\'s a step towards healthier oral care if you don\'t already use an electric toothbrush."

That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that\'s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it\'s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you\'ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It\'s not like they\'ll go stale in the linen closet.Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.Hints:Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you\'re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you\'re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you\'ll do a serious \'eewwww.\'  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.  This is important.Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger. This will make that weekend maintenance simpler.That\'s it! Now get one for yourself and see."

The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  I can\'t comment on the alleged \'flossing action\' since I still floss and I\'m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven\'t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  The things we do for oral hygiene.So yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B\'s Vitality.  That\'s just your teeth and gums howling like Westley from The Princess Bride being tortured.  Well, your teeth and gums are wimps.  They\'ll get used to it and thank you later.  Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you\'ve just had a professional cleaning.  The secret, of course is the much-vaunted circular buffing motion.  You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  Problem solved.  Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there\'s not a lot to complain about.  If you\'ve got the bucks and a hankering for oral hygiene, then you could surely do worse than to invest in Vitality."

I had been using traditional toothbrushes which also had heads that seemed too large for my mouth.The first time I used the Oral-B Vitality I felt as if I had just come from the dentists office. My gums were bleeding and slightly tender.This is not a bad thing! Plainly put,the toothbrush delivered an efficient clean. My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.Since I keep the toothbrush in my bedroom (not enough outlets in the bathroom) I charge it only every other night.  It seems to hold the charge for the nights I forget to plug it in. Nice to know if I go on a business trip and leave the charger behind.While it gets into the crevices in my teeth, flossing should still be a separate step for getting in between the teeth."

You can recharge it once a week, or even once every two weeks, and it\'s fine.  It comes with an elegant recharging stand.  There are a lot of alternative brush heads on the market, such as one for sensitive gums and one for additional whitening power. The one it comes with is top of the line (floss and brush at the same time) and you get two heads in the box.The only downside is that the replacement heads are very expensive.

And it\'s really not too bad for $30.First, you have to realize that if you\'re moving from a normal brush you have to re-learn how to brush. No more moving the brush rapidly with your hand - press the button on the handle and it starts whirling at high speed. Press the brush to your teeth and gums and sloooowly move it left to right or right to left. Make sure you get all three sides of top and bottom, and that you get the gumlines - that\'s the most important part. Obviously it doesn\'t really matter what order you do it in, but if I don\'t keep a pattern I get distracted by pets or people and forget. After two minutes the brush will briefly stop the motor a few times to let you know you\'ve brushed enough - next time you can adjust your movement speed to hit that mark.It includes an induction charger - just set the handle on it. You can do it every night or once a week.So how does this $30 model compare to the $90-120 models? Well, the grip is noticably cheaper, with no rubber grip stripes. The induction charger is very easy to tip over compared to the sturdier \'well\' model. There\'s no charge indicator. The whole thing feels a little bit more flimsy than the 8900, though it never felt like it would actually come apart. There\'s no 30 second indicator like the better models, and there\'s only one speed, though I never found the other speeds on the 8900 useful anyhow.All in all not bad for $30 - of course they\'ll get you for $3-4 each for replacement head, but that\'s only every 3 months or so, and this comes with one head and one spare head. And I think you\'ll do a better job with this than with a regular brush - it\'s very easy to pay for itself if you just get one fewer cavity. If you want one of the above features spring for a better model, but this isn\'t bad for 1/3rd the cost."

Fear of getting electrocuted.My dentist bothered me again during my most check-up this August, and I finally started using this electric toothbrush, and the difference between this and a regular Oral B toothbrush is night and day.Now, if you\'re an obsessive-compulsive and patient brusher, you probably don\'t need this.

My father and I both adopted the philips sonicare system. I got this for my mom who has some sensitive gums that the sonicare irritated when she tried my dad\'s unit.  She is satisfied with the oral-b design.Over the sonicare, this has a smaller brush-head which can get into smaller places easier.Unlike the original oral b brushes, this is rechargable which is a major plus when you get halfway through brushing and the batteries suddenly die.Personally, my preference is for the sonicare system as it really cleans well, but even my father has tried this and thinks it might be doing a better job than the sonicare.Time will tell and I\'ll update my review with new info as the checkups come in.  Since we had used the AA battery verion before, we had extra brush-heads to all try the unit which is good in a family environment.  I think we felt the purchase price of the sonicare alot more since I don\'t live at home and had to buy my own.

I am not the most dedicated of flossers but this electric toothbrush with it\'s Floss Action head does the trick.  The bristles are firm and get between the teeth to remove that heavy plague and gumlines.  I am not advocating this as s DEEP cleanser for that you probably need one of those electric at home Waterpik\'s, but this is the next best and cheapest alternative.While I am not big on rechargeable electric toothbrushes because I believe they are a bit passe, I won\'t discount this brush for being that, and matter of fact the rechargeable unit is not big and clunky as they use to be 10 years ago.

After 2+ years though the battery is finally not having as much power and not lasting as long between charges so I put it on the charge every day. But it doesn\'t quite have the power it did when new. All things considered, I have no problem with this rechargeable toothbrush lasting 2-3 years as that is more than I expected. The best part is that Oral-B still makes the Vitality and I can use the extra brush heads that I previously bought on the new Vitality that I just purchased. The brush heads are not cheap, about $20 for 3 so I did not want them to go to waste. I really like the cleaning action from the Dual Clean brush heads and they don\'t seem to be too harsh either.If you are looking for a great, reliable and inexpensive electric rechargeable toothbrush, I highly recommend Oral-B\'s Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush."

While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I\'m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn\'t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don\'t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I\'d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I\'ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I\'m not a dental health professional, so I don\'t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn\'t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it\'s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can\'t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I\'m afraid I don\'t care for it enough to do even that).If you\'re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I\'ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn\'t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums."

It took some getting used to but after I did I felt it was doing a good job. I recently tried the Oral-b Dual Clean and found it to be a very old school design.  The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  If I only had the choice between this and a manual toothbrush I would choose the manual brush.  I\'m sure it does an okay job and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  I also suggest considering sonic brushes that do not have rotating parts, I think after you get used to them they leave your mouth feeling cleaner."

Nearly the same price as I paid for the sonicare heads the other day.It is a huge step up from manual and $10 grocery store electrics. It leaves my mouth feeling very clean. (Somehow not quite sonicare clean though) It seems like it will accumulate grunge/yellow in the future. Also I\'ve not noticed any of the heads around town, so I will probably have to order those online, which is ok, but I like availability.

My more expensive model seems much more powerful (rightfully so) and also seems to have more \'rotation\' BUT DOES this less expensive model CLEAN TEETH and GUMS WELL? YES.Bottom line I guess is does it get the job done. It works. It certainly feels better than regular ole toothbrushes. It feels like the rotating head is really getting into the gumline.What\'s really nice is that this toothbrush and my other Oral-B both accept the same replaceable brush heads which is great since they usually come in packs of more than one.I recommend this product.

I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.While I have no complaints about its power, the fact that it utilizes two cleaning brushes gives it a much larger brushing surface than with the single brush found on my Soniccare.  While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist."

The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth. After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning. The brush is also smaller and requires you to use less toothpaste, which will result in savings over time. The only downside is that the brushes are a little on the pricey side, but I\'m hoping they last longer than my regular brush.If you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush.

Because of this I\'ve used the old fashioned manual brushes that did a reasonable job of keeping my teeth clean. Well, this tradition is about to change.After using this brush, my teeth have a smooth and polished feel all the way down to just below the gum line! Amazing! Even my manual brushes don\'t do as thorough a job. Also, the brush charges through induction which means that it\'s waterproof and has no wires or metal contact points that need to be protected from water. This is very cool.I could only find one minor downside to this brush which is that the head is somewhat thick. What I mean is that the distance between the bristle tips and back of the head makes it necessary for me to open my mouth fairly wide  to get the brush the tops of my rear molars. This isn\'t a challenge for me but it might be for someone with a smaller mouth.I guess I can summarize my review by saying that I\'m tossing out my manual brushes because this is now my personal favorite.

But by keeping the brush on its stand with the charging cord plugged in I should have maximum power for each brushing.  The instructions that come with the brush say you can leave it plugged in, but recommend that every 6 months you let the battery deplete itself.Like another reviewer, I have sensitive teeth and prefer a soft brush.  The brush head that came with the brush seemed to work just fine for me.  The test will be when I have my next visit to the dentist and learn whether there has been an increase in gum erosion since the last visit.  However, just based on short time use, I have no reason to think there will be a problem.  My brushing includes running the brush over my tongue and the bristles feel no different than my other brushThe brush heads that I used on the previous brush don\'t work on this, but the literature that comes with the brush describes 5 different heads that do.  Quite an interesting variety, including floss action, precision clean, white+clean, and sensitive clean.As is true of most electric toothbrushes, heads are pricey if purchased from a local stored.  Amazon sells them at a heavily discounted price, so it is a good place to buy head replacements.  What I do and recommend that others do is to buy a supply of brushes at a time in order to get the best price and insure you have enough on hand to replace a head every 3 months if used twice a day.  The per head price is cheaper if you buy a pack of 6 heads than if you buy the standard 3 pack.  Amazon has both."

I love it because I have tight gaps between my teeth and this flat ribbon floss easily slips between my teeth and helps to clean even those hard to reach places.  I like the minty taste it leaves behind and most of all I like the feeling of having clean teeth.This is a very good product and I recommend it to you.
3028,3113,20120314,B003XDZ66E,5,"March 14, 2012",A3EHJ5519LG7TR,Like the minty taste.,This is my favorite floss.  The mint taste is the best among all brands.  I would highly recommend this product.
3029,3114,20120313,B003XDZ66E,5,"March 13, 2012",A1Q8ELZ94DDJ7U,Cleans Well,Cleans easily and isn\'t too waxy. Works well. There is more than enough floss on each roll to last a long time.
3036,3122,20120302,B003XE3278,5,"March 2, 2012",A1SC0PCDCLY8R4,Wouldn\'t use any other brand,Oral-b has always been the choice of my family even before I was born. You really feel the benefit of the round edges.
3042,3128,20120121,B00404PFDY,5,"January 21, 2012",A3HRP2Q7ANGJWG,Dentist clean Daily,"My husband and I love this product.  He has a tendancy to brush too hard and the monitor indicates this to improve brushing habits.  I love the 4 areas and the timer for some dome reason it really motivates you to do a great job.  My teeth are much whiter and my gums no longer bleed during flossing.  I love the smaller head for crowded areas or braces.  My dentist actually told me to get the sonicare, but for the price difference on the model and the replacement heads I chose this one and I\'m glad I did.  We had another Oral B probably for 7 years and could no longer find heads that fit it.  I thought we would change to the Sonicare but due to cost, headsize and bad reviews I\'m glad I stayed with Sonicare...I\'ll let you know what my dentist has to say in June."

3047,3133,20120501,B0043VYSI2,5,"May 1, 2012",APJ0VM62OPBYJ,Dentist Recommended-Buyer Approved,My dental hygienist kept recommending that I purchase an electric toothbrush.  She specifically recommended the Oral B electric toothbrush.  After doing some research I quickly learned that the Oral B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 was the top of the line.  I recently purchased this product and have seen a noticeable improvement in my dental checkups.  I would definitely recommend this product.
3049,3135,20120317,B0043VYSI2,1,"March 17, 2012",A3P5PVR3NJYDLY,Sad company,"I just opened the box from, Oral-b Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Electric Toothbrush Dental Professional Excl...Sold by Hugo Cesar De La Rosa (LoneStarResale)Condition: newand it was full of old tooth stuff from someone else. I chose a new one and was send something not so nice. I would not by from Lone Stare."
3054,3140,20120121,B0043VYSI2,5,"January 21, 2012",ALYF6A411T1T8,AMAZING!!! and I mean it!,"So I am a dental health freak... I love brushing and flossing my teeth all the time! I know most people don\'t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn\'t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!Ok now for the research details:1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it\'s time to brush on another side.6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you9. It\'s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn\'t like to brush or doesn\'t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. It guides you so you know you are getting a great cleaning. Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it! So as you can tell I love it and I am very satisfied with my purchase! Good luck and hope it works amazing for you as it does for me and my family!"

This is a small investment compared to the price that will be paid for gum and or teeth loss do to conventional brushing. I will report back after my next checkup."
3059,3145,20111006,B0043VYSI2,5,"October 6, 2011",A1D3AEH4YAC3HJ,Feels Like I Just Got A Professional Cleaning,"I can\'t say enough good things about this toothbrush.  I got it about a year ago from my dentist\'s office, and absolutely love it.  The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...the savings is very significant!).I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn\'t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it\'s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren\'t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don\'t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)"
3061,3147,20110823,B0043VYSI2,5,"August 23, 2011",AF80RIE6INJBB,Excellent buy,I am very happy that I purchase this product instead of several other comparable brands.  I read all the reviews and decided to go with this one.  I noticed a difference in just three days.  At first I experienced slight bleeding of my mug but it stopped after the first day.My teeth are shiner and it feels clean.  I am going to buy another one for my other half who is reluctant to go \'Electric\' :)
