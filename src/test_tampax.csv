I have used Tampax for years and have never had any pain or health problems from their usage, and I will continue to use them till I no longer have a need for them.  Not only that, but the price for a box of 100 is excellent."
3,3,20110628,B000GCNBOO,5,"June 28, 2011",A2PNAN94Q7P5FG,Travel size!,I bought this little box to keep in my camper.. I plan on buying more and keeping them in all my cars too.It is the perfect size to have as a back up!
5,5,20110803,B001G7QJPG,5,"August 3, 2011",A250BWK8424ENU,Amazon shopping is the best!,The product itself most likely does not need to be reviewed as the brand alone is quality.  What I\'m reviewing is the true luxury and convenience of shopping at Amazon.com!  I\'m super busy working full-time and being pulled in many different directions - as I\'m sure many are - so ordering this type of product online has been wonderful.  It sure beats sending the hubby to the store and getting the mystery box when he returns!
7,7,20120129,B001G7QJQA,4,"January 29, 2012",A1FGEZFHTNX2QK,Trusted Friend,"I\'ve tried several different brands and always end up coming back to Tampax Pearl. They are easy to insert, have a pleasant scent (I feel fresher on \'one of those days\' than normal), and they don\'t fall apart when you shove them deep into some compartment of your purse. I always feel happy opening the box and the wrapper, knowing I\'ll be all good every three to six hours, or as needed.Get the unscented if you have sensitivity to scented products."
9,9,20111014,B001G7QJQA,5,"October 14, 2011",A2T8Y1RN0H9BZC,Very nice!,"I was a little wary buying hygiene products from the internet, but I got a great deal with this.  Worth it!  If you\'re a heavy bleeder, these are excellent, and they smell nice.  Certainly worth your money!"
15,15,20110604,B001G7QKAA,1,"June 4, 2011",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,Not so good at all,"It is hard to write a review for tampons without sounding gross, but I will try..I do not like these tampons at all. They seem to try to slip out constantly after an hour or two and I have NEVER experienced that with any tampon in my life. I am 34 years old, so I have been using tampons - many different brands and varieties for 20 years now. This has got to be the worst I have ever used.They always seem to allow leakage as well. This is not from leaving them in too long, or due to extra heavy flow. They just leak, period (no pun intended!!).I ordered these in Super Absorbency from Amazon since they had such a dirt cheap price for the 2 boxes. I did use up both boxes just so I didn\'t feel like I wasted my money, but I will never buy them again. I had the same terrible results with both boxes.I cannot imagine using them if you have extra heavy or heavy flow."

20,20,20110324,B001G7QV18,5,"March 24, 2011",AZA595ZPIG240,Many To Last,I bought this for my girlfriend. Instead of going to local market. I am buying this in bulk online to SAVE TIME AND MONEY.
33,33,20120425,B001H9PUR6,5,"April 25, 2012",A3Q3ZOIIXVKWQF,great product and fast shipping,"3 days from order to UPS receipt at my door.  I have always had a problem buying feminine hygiene products from  the drug store or supermarket, especially in such a quantity. I just find it embarrassing, though it only makes sense to  buy in quantity something you know you will use and save money.Amazon and associated merchants have always been great.  Most of the time I have just bought books. But recently have been buying clothes as well as other products. And even with shipping costs find I can get things cheaper than at local stores.Only bad thing is these have plastic insertion. Not that good for the environment but sure makes insertion much easier."
36,36,20091226,B001K3IH06,5,"December 26, 2009",AHS6R8WDR8828,Perfect size for me!,"I have always had problems with regular tampons being too wide and lites too narrow. This \'slender\' tampon seems to be a good in-between size. It is still quite absorbent, though."

44,44,20111014,B001LK6XHC,5,"October 14, 2011",A7GYKNZCPP0IL,really comfortable,"Easy to use and carry, comfortable and  well absorbency. Actually , I dont need the super absorbency triple. Anyway, I like them and also a good price if on sale."
46,46,20110930,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 30, 2011",A38QHZEEYZKT27,"My wife\'s favorite, beats going to the store","I imagine at this point most women know which Tampons they like, and there\'s really no substitute for trying them for real.  That being said, my wife only uses these.  I can really only review the packaging here, which is probably what you want to know about.  It\'s a multi-pack, containing 10 light and 10 super, and 30 of the regular size tampons.  It\'s a great assortment and last several cycles.  The price, as is usual around here, is excellent.  Save yourself some time and money if this is your brand and get them here."
48,48,20110929,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 29, 2011",A3EKLO0WDCM01F,The best,"Okay so it may be a mildly awkward review to write, but women are the ones who have to go through this ordeal every month and thus have to purchase the proper products, so that\'s that.I would never use anything else.  These have a plastic applicator which is the savior right there.  Even hearing the term \'cardboard applicator\' conjures up images of olden times (like the 1800s) in my head.  I know it\'s a matter of preference but in terms of comfort I have no idea why someone would elect cardboard over plastic, but that\'s just me.The price of these on Amazon is great, especially with the Subscribe & Save program.  It\'s a perfect deal.  I only wish that they made a 50 count pack of regular & super without the light ones as I never need those."
53,53,20110921,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 21, 2011",A1DTCJV6KOMJOA,This Calls for an International Coffee,"I\'ve been using Tampax for many years and have been using the multipack for a while. It is all about convenience, it allows me to grab the right size for the right day. I don\'t have a problem with *cough* insertion (please, take a big sip of coffee). I just love that it gives my wallet a rest and I don\'t have to buy separate packs. And also, we all get stressed out, hormones change, and we tend to not even realize that what started out as a heavy period has lightened up quite a bit before its over and we don\'t need to use one for heavy absorbency."
56,56,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",A141W8WHW9AC3H,My personal fave!,"LOVE Tampax Pearl.  I used to be cheap when it came to tampons, but these are just worth the extra money.  I don\'t know if they seem really all that better as far as preventing leaks, but they always go in smoothly...never any \'misfires\' with the applicator that makes you have to scrap the tampon, waste it and use another (my pet peeve!!)  And I LOVE the lite size for those days at the very end, or even on a day when I have a lot of discharge.  Regular is just too big for that super light flow day at the very end of my period.  5 stars all the way!  And how awesome is having tampons delivered right to your door?!  :-)"
57,57,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",A383XURHVF8ON6,This is what I always buy and use,"I\'ve always bought and used these Tampax Pearl tampons.  Most often I use the Regular absorbency, and rarely the Super.  I\'m on Yasmin which has significantly lessened my period flow, so I occasionally use the Light absorbency too.Cons:1.  Umm... let\'s see.... well, because the applicator is made of plastic, they\'re not the cardboard biodegradable sort of tampon applicator.  However, see my list of pros why this can be a good thing.Pros:1.  The applicator is made of smooth plastic, but with \'Anti-Slip Grip\' - ridges on the part of the applicator where you hold it when putting it in, so you have a better grip.  The last time I used tampons with cardboard applicators, they got slippery as heck when inserting them, so much that they were rendered unusable.  So, these Tampax Pearl tampons are far better in that regard.2.  These are unscented - fragrances in a tampon can cause irritation, so I\'ve always used unscented.3.  Easy to insert, and I don\'t feel them at all once they\'re in.  I will forget that I have a tampon in.4.  They\'ve never leaked, and I\'ll wear each tampon for a full 8-9 hours.  These tampons work.  Period.  HA!  Get it?  Yep, I\'m a dork.5.  The wrapper is super quiet.I do have to say, another reviewer said these tampons \'worked their way out\'... I don\'t know how this could happen.  Perhaps not inserting them far enough?  I put them in as far as they can go, and they\'ve never worked their way out."
58,58,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",ALOWEXH7NJVJB,Terrific Product,A terrific product that I\'ve utilized for what seems like a lifetime.  What a pleasure to have not paid for this product for once.
64,64,20110913,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 13, 2011",A11IKWE7B29TOJ,"Not Bad, But I Wouldn\'t Switch From My Regular Brand","I\'m a Playtex girl through and through. No idea how I got started buying the Playtex brand, but I\'ve stuck to it for about 12 years now. I was open to trying Pearl because a) the Tampax name is a good one, b) I love the idea of Pearl- the word just sounds nice and comfortable, and c) How different can tampons be, anyway?These tampons weren\'t bad, but they also weren\'t quite as comfortable as my regular Playtex (Gentle Glide, in case you\'re wondering). They seemed a little cheaper and the actual tampon definitely wasn\'t as sturdy and ended up actually falling apart a bit.Oh, but I am a fan of the super to easy open packaging. I just don\'t think I\'d replace my Playtex for these.And this is officially the most awkward Amazon review I\'ve written...."
68,68,20110908,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 8, 2011",A2GK5S3ZF9Y8YO,The only tampons I use,"I have been a loyal Tampax Pearl customer since I discovered these tampons a few years ago. They go in very easily, and I\'ve never had the problems with them falling out that some other reviewers have mentioned. For someone who has a heavy flow (as I do), this multipack won\'t cover all of your needs, but this one box should last a long time. I usually buy this multipack plus another box of Supers and a box of Super Plus, and I\'m set for several months. I\'ve tried Playtex Gentle Glide and Kotex U, but I keep coming back to Tampax Pearl--I simply haven\'t found a better tampon!"
69,69,20110908,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 8, 2011",A38MQHVEICK46P,Great Product,"I love this product!  Feminine hygiene isn\'t exactly a topic that is often discussed, but I just wanted to cast my vote for Tampax Pearl.  They are comfortable, easy to use, and offer great protection.  I won\'t use the generic brand as these are worth the extra cost.  I think they are a great value."
72,72,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",ALBW2ZBS6Z2AY,BEST TAMPONS EVER,"These are now my new favorites.I had previously tried a store brand version of the \' Pearl\' that was quite inferior, so be sure to get the real thing.The applicator has a nice shape, the braided part of the string prevents leaks, and unlike many tampons, the absorbency is not exaggerated.I also like the combination of 3 different sizes in this box, which is quite large and will keep you prepared for at  least several months.A product with no drawbacks that I sincerely recommend."
74,74,20110904,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 4, 2011",A2BPB05QNCE00B,Love the multipack,"I\'ve been using Tampax for a while now. I love the plastic applicator on these. It makes it easier to put in. The best feature about this box is the fact that there are multiple absorbances. You get 30 Regulars, 10 light and 10 super which is the perfect amount of each in my opinion. This product offers great protection at an affordable price."
81,81,20110830,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 30, 2011",A22I55P15NSAOX,Easy to use and the variety is useful.  Excellent protection.,"Although the plastic does generate more non biodegradable waste it makes the use of this product so much simpler, especially for girls just starting to use tampons.  Including various sizes means that you can select the minimum absorbency needed.  Although I tend to gravitate toward the cheaper (and more earth friendly) cardboard versions I do buy these Pearls for my daughter.  There is also a Lite compact version, which she favors for taking with her, as the size of the package is smaller and easier to slip into a pocket or purse.  If you put ease of use over cost then these are the tampons to buy. I highly suggest the Pearl versions for young girls."
82,82,20110829,B001LK6XHC,4,"August 29, 2011",A34C98SJU4M7DD,Great Multipack! They DO What They Are Ment To Do!,"The Tampax Pearl tampons do what they are intended to do.I have tried many brands of tampons over the years, they are NOT all created equal and Tampax  are a great brand and it has been a regular brand that I use! Do not have to worry about accidents! They come in a handy variety box.The plasic applicator makes them more comfortable to use and the only type I will use!"
83,83,20110828,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 28, 2011",A257XGMVGITLCT,TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS,"TAMPAX PEARL PLASTIC TRIPLE PACKHaving been a constant customer of Tampax brand tampons, I have told my daughter about these wonderful tampons -- it is her turn to carry the torch now that I am nearing sixty years of age!My daughter loves this tampon as much as I did.  The Tampax Pearl Plastics are new and improved over what I was using in the past.  There is now a clean guard layer that surrounds the core of the tampon giving the user that much needed extra layer of protection.  Also, there\'s a leak guard braid that helps to catch those pesky and embarrassing leaks.  These tampons are also form-fitting and conforms to each individual\'s unique shape.There is a smooth rounded plastic tip for easy and comfortable insertion and the plastic applicator has an anti-slip grip.  Also the wrapper is almost cute and has easy to open tabs.The best thing about this product -- besides all the added protection now available to users -- is being available in a box of fifty.  There are ten tampons for light days, thirty for regular usage, and then the ten super duper size needed for those extra heavy moments.My daughter swears by this product and will purchase no other.  She is a first grade teacher and doesn\'t get many bathroom breaks and is constantly on her feet.  She doesn\'t have to worry about leaking problems, feels comfortable and secure, and can have every size necessary for whatever protection she is seeking.An A+ on this product.Thank you!Pam"
84,84,20110828,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 28, 2011",A2J557IQKW3GCP,Absolute Favorite.,"I\'ve have tried so many tampons- because of price, quality- just always looking for a better product. But I always go back to Tampax Pearl. This is my absolute favorite tampon. It is a little higher priced than other products, but it is worth the extra cash. And I love this variety pack- what a great idea having three different absorbances in one pack. Perfect for me.There is only one con- this isn\'t an organic product, at all. I\'m hoping that in the future Tampax tries to incorporate that more into this product.Tampax Pearl tampons are the most comfortable and easy to use tampons out there. Not to mention the reliable protection. I highly recommend this product."

88,88,20110622,B001LK6XHC,5,"June 22, 2011",A3DD2R0RYMAJWZ,I have used every single one,"They are absolutely a necessity for every woman! Not only that, but they are comfortable, affordable and come in a variety of absorbency strengths to be of use for all types of menstrual flow.Without these tampons I might have had to use a small towel or furry animal to soak up all the blood!Thanks Kotex!p.s. I have only one recommendation: I think that you should over a promotion or a coupon savings for customers who save all their used tampon applicators and send them in. Carbonated beverage companies do that for their cans, as well as some candy bar companies in respect to their wrappers. It is just a suggestion but I think it would be very beneficial for everyone."

93,93,20110617,B001LK6XHW,5,"June 17, 2011",AOY1BUICNSYYK,The one.,"The string on these makes all the difference.I must say that after trying just about every type of brand of tampon out there, Tampax Pearl is the only one i can rely on to not leak. There are instances when it does, but that is only when it can\'t hold anymore in, which is rare -- and if this happens Ultra is the way to go.Another plus is the applicator, which is plastic and so much easier to use than the paper cardboard ones other brand have.I must say i have found the one that works for me and the price on here is hard to beat."

I this is my most preferred tampon. It is very easy to use.. I love that it glides well and that the opening of the applicator has a more rounded design so that it doesn\'t cause discomfort when being used.
108,108,20110318,B001LK6XI6,2,"March 18, 2011",A27A83F6FXWX6V,Performs Well but Trashes Environment,"I tried the sample Tampax Pearl tampons included with a box of their regular cardboard applicator tampons.  I had no problem with the performance of the tampon (although it was a bit more difficult to use), but I\'m quite bothered by the production and disposal of this product.  It feels so wasteful to use plastic so briefly and then toss it in the trash.  The plastic is made from oil, which keeps us dependent on other countries and pollutes the air, and then it lingers on in landfills or floats out to sea.  It was recently reported that whale carcasses washing up on California\'s beaches had plastic tampon applicators in their stomachs, among other debris.No, I think Tampax would do better to improve upon their cardboard applicators which at least can be sourced from recycled paperboard or from sustainably managed forests.  Or perhaps I\'ll forgo the applicator all together and just use o.b. tampons."

No reviews yet?- I really like this applicator. Since it\'s a \'pearl\'-like plastic, it slides in easily and comfortably. I also find that it\'s easy to grip the tip while pushing the tampon in. With other brands, I can\'t get a good grip and just end up pushing the whole darn thing in.- Regular is the way to go, I find; I don\'t like the bulk of bigger tampons.- I feel more comfortable with unscented products. Granted, I\'ve never tried a scented one, but... I don\'t think there should be any perfuming going on down there.So yup.  I\'m pretty loyal to these. Available pretty much everywhere, fortunately."

To me they are also more comfortable to wear than the normal sized tampons.  I think the tampon itself is slightly shorter in length, but it still has the same absorbency.  The only drawback would be that the wrapper is very noisy."

The size and absorbency seems to be comparable, and I am able to make it through the night with these.  I am sad to be putting the plastic of the applicator into the landfill, but happy that I know I\'m 46 and only have a few years to go.  I do miss the convenience of being able to put the ob\'s in my pocket.  Hopefully someone will see the need of a tampon like the ob ultra."

With the exception of the first 24 hours of my cycle, with these, I don\'t need to change as often. I feel \'ultra\' secure with these. For example, if I use one right before leaving the house, I feel confident that I can make it to my destination without having to RUSH to the nearest restroom or worry about \'accidents.\' Beware though, and don\'t get too overconfident in these. Especially during the early days, you still need to closely monitor yourself. BUT, these provide a lot more reassurance, and because you use fewer in the moderate to lighter days, you save money. They\'re really the only level of protection needed."

Just keep them in the saved-for-later part of your cart to monitor the price as your refill date approaches (or manually control the subscription deliveries)."

I don\'t know why other reviewers are saying that they take some \'getting used to\' ... they are EXACTLY like any other tampon except that they\'re stored \'in half\', so to speak - the tampon half inside of the applicator half - for greater discretion. Once you click them open (which takes about one second - if you can click a ballpoint pen, you can do this) they are exactly like every other tampon, and you just insert them as normal.Another great thing about these tampons is the packaging. The external package (the part that says \'Tampax Compak Pearl\') contains four boxes of 10 tampons each: one purple box of 10 lites, two yellow boxes of 10 regulars, and one green box of 10 supers. The color-coded boxes are very discreet; they are just pretty patterns with no words printed on them at all. Very nice for when you want to store some tampons in your desk at work, in your locker at school, or in your boyfriend\'s bathroom. ;)"

This has got to be my favorite christmas present.  They were just so much fun to use!  Which reminds me, I was disappointed I was only able to find these new.  I can usually get a discount by buying used on amazon, but I don\'t find any of these plastic lite pearls for sale used anywhere?!Ok, so I bought these for my wife and I\'m being a bit tongue in cheek.  She was really happy."

Sure there are all the flashy new tampon types out there nowadays, with all their new \'technology\' and \'improvements\'  (and really, how much technology can go into a tampon?? It\'s cotton on a string afterall!) and all the flashy advertising, but I am always let down with a leak of some sort. This has been the only tampon that I can count on over the years. There are never any leaks, no wet strings - nothing to worry about at all.They do what they are supposed to do without any issues at all and they are cheap. You can fully dispose of the entire product, wrapper, applicator and all, by flushing it down the toilet. Cheap, efficient, reliable - what more could you want?"
