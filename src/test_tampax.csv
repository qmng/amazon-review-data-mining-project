Plus, I\'m a petite person, and I get frustrated with multipacks like these, because the largest tampon I can use is the regular size, so most of the tampons go to waste.  If you\'re petite, definitely don\'t get these.  If you\'re not, be sure to buy a whole bunch of lubricant to go with them.  I used them for years, but didn\'t know what I was missing: plastic tampons!  I recommend Kotex--much less of a pain, literally."

They are the most reliable tampons out there. I actually really like these better than the \'Tampax Pearl\' ones, as I can\'t stand the closed top and plastic applicator on the \'Pearl\'. These are my tried and true brand. I will never buy another. I also love the mix pack for the various stages of my cycle.I also am a subscribe & save fanatic! I save money, but I really just appreciate saving so much time by not having to go to the store. We always stock up on stuff and used to do so at a club store. Now we just use subscribe & save. On items like these, where you know you\'ll be buying them periodically for a long time, subscribe & save is awesome!"
23,23,20120209,B001G7QV1I,5,"February 9, 2012",A2AJ85T9EYTMUO,busy busy mom,I\'ve used Tampax tampons for as long as I can remember.  These work as well as they ever have.  Not sure if the numbers of each in the box will match up with my needs but we\'ll see.  Nice to not have to buy multiple boxes.  Might be nice to have the pearl version but doesn\'t seem worth the extra cost.  Happy with these.
24,24,20120110,B001G7QV1I,5,"January 10, 2012",A2JST3B1JUFH46,tampax,They get the job done. What else is there to say? I just wish I had gotten plastic instead of cardboard
25,25,20111103,B001G7QV1I,4,"November 3, 2011",A25GKR5BCDEON7,Good but bad.,I have recently decided to find the staple tampon brand that I will use for the rest of my period-having life and these may be it... I am also reducing my pad usage to nights when I will be asleep for a long time.  One of the main reasons is the flushable applicator.  I\'m no longer going to waste extra tissues wrapping the applicator up to hide in the trash.  And think about all the waste I am reducing.The only con about this would have to be the fact that they have blunt tips.  The cotton is exposed at the tip and it is not tapered.  It can be uncomfortable when inserting.
27,27,20100609,B001G7QV1I,2,"June 9, 2010",A1L8X5TUG6TIWX,An unnecessary new design ruined Tampax.,"I picked up a box assuming that this would be the same product I first tried several years ago... These are the worst tampons I\'ve used. You feel them after insertion. I kept going back to the bathroom because I felt like I needed to readjust. It never seemed to help. Very uncomfortable! Reviewers on drugstore.com have claimed that these actually gave them cramps. Ouch! The cardboard applicators, while being easier to manipulate than the nightmarish Playtex Beyond, can still be difficult. And I\'ve been flushing them with some apprehension even though the box says it\'s okay. Bad, bad, bad. They really effed up a classic brand here. Tampax tampons are inferior to just about every other tampon available now.Pearl is the only Tampax style worth considering...and even then there are cheaper and better tampons, such as Kotex Security, Playtex Gentle Glide, and Playtex Sport.I would only buy these again if absolutely nothing else were available to me."
33,33,20120425,B001H9PUR6,5,"April 25, 2012",A3Q3ZOIIXVKWQF,great product and fast shipping,"3 days from order to UPS receipt at my door.  I have always had a problem buying feminine hygiene products from  the drug store or supermarket, especially in such a quantity. I just find it embarrassing, though it only makes sense to  buy in quantity something you know you will use and save money.Amazon and associated merchants have always been great.  Most of the time I have just bought books. But recently have been buying clothes as well as other products. And even with shipping costs find I can get things cheaper than at local stores.Only bad thing is these have plastic insertion. Not that good for the environment but sure makes insertion much easier."
34,34,20110806,B001K3IH06,3,"August 6, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Used to be my favorite- now not quite as comfortable,"I used to love these because they are the smallest tampon on the market and have a flushable applicator and wrapper.  Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion. Kotex is a reasonably priced brand that is more comfortable to remove than these."

I never use light so those just ended up in the trash. I fond of Kotex but would purchase this brand, but not this pack with the Super/Reg/Light"
49,49,20110928,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 28, 2011",A3CNM18PWKI1Z9,Nothing Beats Tampax Pearl,"In the world of tampons, no brand can beat Tampax. No matter how hard they try, Tampax\'s competitors never manage to reproduce the 100% hassle-free experience of Tampax. They always mess up one thing or another while Tampax manages to offer solutions to every single aspect of your menstruation.At the same time, in the world of Tampax tampons, Tampax Pearl, in my opinion, is the very best. It\'s the most comfortable, easy to use variety of Tampax. I think it\'s a brilliant idea to sell this kind of variety packs because you can just buy a 50-count box and use it for several menstrual cycles in a variety of situations.Tampax has surely done a lot over the years to make women\'s lives easier, and I salute them for it."
50,50,20110926,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 26, 2011",A28WXDXJA1P0MC,The only tampons I use!,"I love these. I much prefer the plastic over the horrid cardboard applicators. The variety pack is the way to go. I don\'t know what it is between these and other brands, but I just feel like this offer better absorbency and protection."
52,52,20110923,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 23, 2011",A1IW1ANBV0DPVI,Best Tampons Out There,"I LOVE Tampax Pearl\'s - so many other brands try to duplicate this product but they just don\'t get it exactly right - the durable, strong wrappers that can hold up in any crowded bag, the ergonomic applicators w/ no slip grips on the sides, the super absorbant cord - they\'re the best, love these tampons, and I love these assorted packs - it keeps you from having to buy a separate box for heavier or lighter days - what a great way to save some coins."
54,54,20110920,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 20, 2011",A3CHMHGSJSQ02J,Good multipack,"Like many reviewers have said, this multipack has just the right mix of sizes/absorbencies for the average woman. One of the things I normally don\'t like about plastic-applicator tampons is the heavy fragrance/scent. It just seems unhealthy to me, and it\'s one of the reasons I prefer cardboard applicators. The Unscented tampons here are a great idea. The plastic applicator is also easier to use than others I\'ve tried, which are always much too thin in the \'grip\' area, causing (TMI ALERT) painful stabbing and pinching.I\'ll probably gravitate back to my usual cardboard Tampax, but this product is definitely a good value for those who prefer plastic."
55,55,20110917,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 17, 2011",AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,Works as Designed,"This is obviously a review written by wife for the ladies:When it comes to that time of the month, I am not devoted to any one product.  Really, I see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for because the costs for feminine hygiene products are getting up there.  I never tried the Tampax Pearls because they are usually the most expensive box.  I thought I would give it a shot.  The applicator is very smooth and easy to insert unlike the cardboard applicators.  Obviously, this isn\'t good for the environment but I prefer these over the flushable applicators that usually clog my toilet.  The insert itself is comfortable enough.  I was skeptical of the braided string, however, I learned the hard way that the braid really does help with some leaks.  The issue I have, as I am sure many woman do, is the number of tampons included in each absorbancy.  I like the multipak idea but I am always left with a lot of one absorbancy over another."
56,56,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",A141W8WHW9AC3H,My personal fave!,"LOVE Tampax Pearl.  I used to be cheap when it came to tampons, but these are just worth the extra money.  I don\'t know if they seem really all that better as far as preventing leaks, but they always go in smoothly...never any \'misfires\' with the applicator that makes you have to scrap the tampon, waste it and use another (my pet peeve!!)  And I LOVE the lite size for those days at the very end, or even on a day when I have a lot of discharge.  Regular is just too big for that super light flow day at the very end of my period.  5 stars all the way!  And how awesome is having tampons delivered right to your door?!  :-)"
59,59,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",AIIR8E34EDKCQ,One of the better brands out there,"Tampax Pearl is way better than regular Tampax tampons, the applicator no longer feels like a torture device and they work great at night or during day, I also appreciate the different sizes even though I don\'t usually need other than regular, they\'re good to share if you have sisters and friends and there\'s nothing more annoying than running out, so this is great for stocking up.Just remember not to flush the applicator, plastic doesn\'t do well in the septic system :P"
61,61,20110914,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 14, 2011",A33Y8C4818EJL0,"Trusted brand, dependable protection","Lets face it, tampons are not the most interesting or comfortable item to discuss, or to review.  But this is a reliable product from brand I\'ve trusted for many years.  As a woman who has tried nearly every brand out there, I can honestly say I do prefer Tampax over its competitors.  I have never bought a multi-box before and this is somewhat convenient, but I will probably buy refills of my needed size next time.  The plastic applicators are much more comfortable and easier to use than cardboard.  The wrappers are sturdy enough to survive in my purse as well."
63,63,20110913,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 13, 2011",A2M14CFAMF8J7I,A snug and absorbent fit,"I\'ve tried different kinds of Tampax for years, but always find them too long. So until now, my favorite brand it has been O.B. After trying Tampax Pearl Plastic, I\'m switching brands. I like the comfortable plastic applicator more, and Tampax Pearl are a snug and absorbent fit. I like the size assortment in this box, but  I will buy a box of Tampax Pearl Super Absorbency for the heavy days, and keep these for the days where my period fluctuates."
67,67,20110908,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 8, 2011",A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,Excellent and Superior To Regular Tampax!,"The Tampax Pearl tampons are the very best in my opinion of all the tampons with an applicator. Ok, well this is going to be a bit personal.  But what I like about these are they do easily glide in, they are not as long and weirdly shaped as regular Tampax and some other brands and they just \'fit\' better. Also, they expand properly in the width and absorb well, so I have not had any worries about leaking.  In addition, its a nice bonus that this pack comes with three different sizes to use as your flow changes. These are unscented- perfect for those of us who don\'t like those flowery perfumed scents. These are a tad pricey, but worth the cost in my opinion and I will deifnitely continue to use these."
74,74,20110904,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 4, 2011",A2BPB05QNCE00B,Love the multipack,"I\'ve been using Tampax for a while now. I love the plastic applicator on these. It makes it easier to put in. The best feature about this box is the fact that there are multiple absorbances. You get 30 Regulars, 10 light and 10 super which is the perfect amount of each in my opinion. This product offers great protection at an affordable price."
77,77,20110902,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 2, 2011",A3EI4K5U61UZ7,Great variety pack,"Great variety pack for those periods when flow varies.  The plastic applicator is more comfortable to use than the cardboard, however it is obviously not as biodegradable.  The unscented variety is good for those with sensitivity to perfumes."
80,80,20110831,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 31, 2011",A2V5R832QCSOMX,"Work great, and it\'s nice to have various sizes","I\'ve been using Tampax Pearls for about two years, and I\'ve only had some problems with leaking when I\'ve used the \'Normal\' size the first few days of my period.  With the boxes like this one that have several sizes/levels, though, I\'ve never had problems, and I really like how the three levels are available for the various points of your period.These are easy to use and insert, and comfortable.  The textured string also makes them easy to removed since they actually provide a good grip.The price on the 50-pack is also great, especially with Subscribe and Save; my local retailer charges about 1 1/2 times the cost that Amazon is charging.Overall, this is my favorite tampon, and I definitely recommend them."
81,81,20110830,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 30, 2011",A22I55P15NSAOX,Easy to use and the variety is useful.  Excellent protection.,"Although the plastic does generate more non biodegradable waste it makes the use of this product so much simpler, especially for girls just starting to use tampons.  Including various sizes means that you can select the minimum absorbency needed.  Although I tend to gravitate toward the cheaper (and more earth friendly) cardboard versions I do buy these Pearls for my daughter.  There is also a Lite compact version, which she favors for taking with her, as the size of the package is smaller and easier to slip into a pocket or purse.  If you put ease of use over cost then these are the tampons to buy. I highly suggest the Pearl versions for young girls."

The Tampax Pearl Plastics are new and improved over what I was using in the past.  There is now a clean guard layer that surrounds the core of the tampon giving the user that much needed extra layer of protection.  Also, there\'s a leak guard braid that helps to catch those pesky and embarrassing leaks.  These tampons are also form-fitting and conforms to each individual\'s unique shape.There is a smooth rounded plastic tip for easy and comfortable insertion and the plastic applicator has an anti-slip grip.  Also the wrapper is almost cute and has easy to open tabs.The best thing about this product -- besides all the added protection now available to users -- is being available in a box of fifty.  There are ten tampons for light days, thirty for regular usage, and then the ten super duper size needed for those extra heavy moments.My daughter swears by this product and will purchase no other.  She is a first grade teacher and doesn\'t get many bathroom breaks and is constantly on her feet.  She doesn\'t have to worry about leaking problems, feels comfortable and secure, and can have every size necessary for whatever protection she is seeking.An A+ on this product.Thank you!Pam"
85,85,20110825,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 25, 2011",ACEA95FQS1AVP,convenient multi-pack,"I usually use Playtex tampons, mainly because they have a large multi-pack and plastic applciators.  So, when I saw that Tampax was offering a similar product, I decided to try it.  I find both products protect equally well (anyway, they are all limited by regulations on how absorbant they can be due to that Rely scare years ago), so it really comes down to price and convenience.  This box has a good assortment with 10 lites, 10 super and the largest portion of regulars - which will probably suit most women.  The price via the Amazon Subscribe and Save is very reasonable (and much cheaper than my grocery store), and definitely convenient being delivered right to your door.  I don\'t have to worry about running out, and for some women who are uncomfortable buying them in stores this is a great alternative.Overall, a good reiable product from a reputable brand at a reasonable price.  Recommended."

I mostly got this box because of the price, which is a lot cheaper than buying in store. However, the variety (light, regular, super) allowed me to try different types and find the ones that work best for me. Every woman is different and might have a different experience with these."
93,93,20110617,B001LK6XHW,5,"June 17, 2011",AOY1BUICNSYYK,The one.,"The string on these makes all the difference.I must say that after trying just about every type of brand of tampon out there, Tampax Pearl is the only one i can rely on to not leak. There are instances when it does, but that is only when it can\'t hold anymore in, which is rare -- and if this happens Ultra is the way to go.Another plus is the applicator, which is plastic and so much easier to use than the paper cardboard ones other brand have.I must say i have found the one that works for me and the price on here is hard to beat."

110,110,20120117,B00284B56Y,1,"January 17, 2012",ATMMHGCOW9BDV,Horrible,"I absolutely HATE these tampons. It\'s irritating that it\'s impossible to find light tampons anywhere, which is why I decided to try these. First of all, the applicator is pretty crappy and can be painful. It\'s not very smoothe at all and the actual tampons get super long and kinda huge once they\'re inside and that was really painful for me. Because of how weird and long they get, they would start to come out (without even having absorbed anything yet!) and rub weird and hurt even more :/"

113,113,20110821,B00284B56Y,5,"August 21, 2011",A22I55P15NSAOX,These are the ones for your daughter to try as first tampons.,These are the ones for your young daughter to try to use when she first starts learning to use a tampon.  The plastic makes them easier to insert (also buy her some lubricant and have her stand up with her foot up on the toilet or even higher ).  The \'lip\' at the edge of the tampon makes it easier to grip as well. The LITES are smaller and easier for a young girl to use. The small size and individual wrapping makes them easy to put in a pocket.Use your own judgement to make sure that she is mature enough to remember to remove them at regular intervals.  But if she participates in sports/swimming/dance having this option is invaluable so that she can participate in her normal activities.

As women we have all probably figured out what our favorite brands are and what features we find best to suit our particular needs. I use light absorbency tampons which for some reason are rather difficult to find in retail stores, and when I do find them they are typically 2 times the price of others and there isn\'t ever a generic cheaper version. I purchased this 3 pack of 20 count tampons because there was a coupon offered at the time and with subscribe and save they ended up only being around 3 dollars a box. I have always liked the comfortable plastic applicator of the tampax \'pearl\' series, the compact style (1/2 the size of a regular applicator tampon) is such a wonderful feature, especially if carrying in your purse and they\'re small enough that you could inconspicuously tote one around in your pants pocket if need be. Just in case any of you aren\'t familiar with how the compact feature works...you remove the 1/2 sized tampon from the wrapper, hold the bottom textured part of the applicator, then simply pull out the base piece which will lock into place once completely pulled out (it aligns itself behind the cotton tampon inside) then viola you have a full sized tampon to use! Very convenient! I guess that\'s everything :) Reminder to you ladies out there...always remember to use the appropriate absorbency for your flow or you risk serious injury, even death form toxic shock. I believe they should sell light absorbency tampons more places instead of forcing women to use regular absorbency due to lack of availability...it\'s very dangerous and very serious...I had a friend that nearly died of TSS and it is a horrible thing to go through."

When I first got my period I was in complete panic. At first I didn\'t use tampons and I only used pads.. boy was that a nightmare! I somehow always got stains on my butt in school and every single person knew that I had my period lol. Super embarrassing... anyhow, thank god for tampons because I never had that problem ever again! I searched for the best tampon for about a week and finally got to these and never thought twice again, these are amazing. They are comfortable, easy to slide in, they absorb an amazing amount and I almost never even get a drip on my emergency pad/pantyliner. If you do not have heavy flow though I do not recommend these and they are pretty big compared to super and below. If you do have heavy for first days then they are perfect for that too and then just switch to a lighter absorbency when it gets towards the end of your period. These are awesome and the price is a good deal too. :)"

Now, given, I only use them for a couple, maybe three days, but no more leaking after one hour, two, or even three! And, amazingly, they seem to be a better shape than the super (orange) pearls, so hold better and feel better, too. I used these for the first time in when I found them in Colorado and was thrilled. But, for the life of me, couldn\'t find them in California where I live (what, do the CA buyers think it\'s an \'altitude\' thing? CA buyers, get w/ the program!). Though I am not a regular Amazon shopper, I stumbled upon them and was thrilled at a good price, and TWO boxes. (trust me, you\'ll want two. Who wants to run out?) I hope other ladies who try them are as happy as I have been with the results. Don\'t ditch the liner or pad yet, but don\'t panic after 45 minutes either. Good luck!"

The only reason I didn\'t give it all five stars is that we\'re still stuck with the applicator. I\'m just thankful I\'ve found this product!"
143,143,20101018,B00284B59G,5,"October 18, 2010",A165SAZZONY1P4,love \'em,"I\'ve always had to rely on OB Ultra tampons to deal with my excessively heavy flow as they are the only tampon out there that is up to the job. I hate though that they have no applicators.  The Tampax Pearl Ultra is just as good as the OB Ultra and there is the very useful, non messy applicator. Makes a yucky situation a bit more bearable."

161,161,20110816,B003CP13OM,3,"August 16, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Tampax changed the design- not very comfortable anymore,"These provide good protection, don\'t leak, and the applicator and wrapper are flushable and biodegradable. I definitely prefer to buy cardboard over plastic. Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion."
