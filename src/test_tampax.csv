3,3,20110628,B000GCNBOO,5,"June 28, 2011",A2PNAN94Q7P5FG,Travel size!,I bought this little box to keep in my camper.. I plan on buying more and keeping them in all my cars too.It is the perfect size to have as a back up!
7,7,20120129,B001G7QJQA,4,"January 29, 2012",A1FGEZFHTNX2QK,Trusted Friend,"I\'ve tried several different brands and always end up coming back to Tampax Pearl. They are easy to insert, have a pleasant scent (I feel fresher on \'one of those days\' than normal), and they don\'t fall apart when you shove them deep into some compartment of your purse. I always feel happy opening the box and the wrapper, knowing I\'ll be all good every three to six hours, or as needed.Get the unscented if you have sensitivity to scented products."
14,14,20110626,B001G7QKAA,5,"June 26, 2011",A1G7BWPCA5UYRF,Great Value,"I\'ve used Tampax Pearl for years, and Amazon has the same great product you find in the stores.  No issues at all with this purchase, and I\'ll keep these on subscribe and save."
17,17,20110708,B001G7QRG2,5,"July 8, 2011",A2QNHF6YQIU82P,Tampax lites,I ordered the tampons from Amazon because it was cheaper than buying them in the store and they came right to my door for free.  Sweet!
18,18,20100914,B001G7QRG2,5,"September 14, 2010",A24J5X4XP7IY0V,Hard to find,Great price on Amazon.  I can\'t find these locally in stores anymore so I was pleased to find them here on Amazon.  Great product and great price!
20,20,20110324,B001G7QV18,5,"March 24, 2011",AZA595ZPIG240,Many To Last,I bought this for my girlfriend. Instead of going to local market. I am buying this in bulk online to SAVE TIME AND MONEY.
22,22,20120216,B001G7QV1I,5,"February 16, 2012",A1UC50DYFPSXYD,These are the BEST!,"It\'s a weird to review a feminine hygeine product. Anyhow, I\'ve used these for twenty years. Love them. They are the most reliable tampons out there. I actually really like these better than the \'Tampax Pearl\' ones, as I can\'t stand the closed top and plastic applicator on the \'Pearl\'. These are my tried and true brand. I will never buy another. I also love the mix pack for the various stages of my cycle.I also am a subscribe & save fanatic! I save money, but I really just appreciate saving so much time by not having to go to the store. We always stock up on stuff and used to do so at a club store. Now we just use subscribe & save. On items like these, where you know you\'ll be buying them periodically for a long time, subscribe & save is awesome!"
23,23,20120209,B001G7QV1I,5,"February 9, 2012",A2AJ85T9EYTMUO,busy busy mom,I\'ve used Tampax tampons for as long as I can remember.  These work as well as they ever have.  Not sure if the numbers of each in the box will match up with my needs but we\'ll see.  Nice to not have to buy multiple boxes.  Might be nice to have the pearl version but doesn\'t seem worth the extra cost.  Happy with these.
28,28,20100213,B001G7QV1I,5,"February 13, 2010",A3J4HLF05HDZM8,Box of \'pons,"You get what you pay for, a giant box of tampons.Sometimes I wish they had \'extra super\' size for that first day included.I have to buy a separate pack and to tell you the truth, I sometimes buy up and buy the pearls."
29,29,20090212,B001GCU10U,3,"February 12, 2009",A2XNJJ9TF70P4J,"Good, but not great.","They are pretty comfortable, that\'s about it. Nothing amazing. Better than regular tampons. One thing I noticed is that the string always irritated me. By the end of my period I would always be irritated down there and I didn\'t know why. When I figured it out, I switched to Playtex Sport, BIG DIFFERENCE, Playtex Sport\'s are SO MUCH more comfortable and better than Tampax Pearl, and the string isn\'t irritating.Plus, one of my friends used to use Tampax Pearl\'s and the string came off and she couldn\'t get the tampon out."
34,34,20110806,B001K3IH06,3,"August 6, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Used to be my favorite- now not quite as comfortable,"I used to love these because they are the smallest tampon on the market and have a flushable applicator and wrapper.  Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion. Kotex is a reasonably priced brand that is more comfortable to remove than these."
35,35,20110708,B001K3IH06,5,"July 8, 2011",A2QNHF6YQIU82P,Tampax Slender Regular tampons,"I like the slender tampons because they have the same absorbency as the regular-sized ones but go in a little more easily, especially if you have a light flow and have trouble getting another tampon in when you have just removed one.  Amazon\'s price was better than I can get in the grocery store, plus they don\'t always have this size available there.  I also got free shipping, so I had nothing to lose."
36,36,20091226,B001K3IH06,5,"December 26, 2009",AHS6R8WDR8828,Perfect size for me!,"I have always had problems with regular tampons being too wide and lites too narrow. This \'slender\' tampon seems to be a good in-between size. It is still quite absorbent, though."
37,37,20090407,B001K3IH06,5,"April 7, 2009",A1JTQCIL88W9JV,Hard to find item delivered to your door,"At the grocery or drugstore it is hard to find a box of \'slender\' only. Usually they are mixed in an assortment. For those with young daughters who want to avoid the whole pad thing, this is a great starter size. It is actually a regular, that has been slimmed down to an easier size for rookies. So pleased that Amazon stocks this item."
41,41,20120216,B001LK6XHC,4,"February 16, 2012",AGBFIQMV9L61Y,I\'ll stick with cardboard applicators.,"Tampax tampons are my go-to brand. I usually buy the 50-count box with cardboard applicators but thought I\'d finally give these Pearls a try.They are just as effective as what I am used to using. The only difference is the plastic applicator, which, honestly, does move things along more smoothly. However, for the money, there isn\'t enough of a difference between these two types to make me spring for the higher-priced version of tampon.I will say, though, that if you are just starting to use tampons, a plastic applicator might be more comfortable--and that would probably make paying a little extra money for the Pearls worthwhile."
44,44,20111014,B001LK6XHC,5,"October 14, 2011",A7GYKNZCPP0IL,really comfortable,"Easy to use and carry, comfortable and  well absorbency. Actually , I dont need the super absorbency triple. Anyway, I like them and also a good price if on sale."
52,52,20110923,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 23, 2011",A1IW1ANBV0DPVI,Best Tampons Out There,"I LOVE Tampax Pearl\'s - so many other brands try to duplicate this product but they just don\'t get it exactly right - the durable, strong wrappers that can hold up in any crowded bag, the ergonomic applicators w/ no slip grips on the sides, the super absorbant cord - they\'re the best, love these tampons, and I love these assorted packs - it keeps you from having to buy a separate box for heavier or lighter days - what a great way to save some coins."
56,56,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",A141W8WHW9AC3H,My personal fave!,"LOVE Tampax Pearl.  I used to be cheap when it came to tampons, but these are just worth the extra money.  I don\'t know if they seem really all that better as far as preventing leaks, but they always go in smoothly...never any \'misfires\' with the applicator that makes you have to scrap the tampon, waste it and use another (my pet peeve!!)  And I LOVE the lite size for those days at the very end, or even on a day when I have a lot of discharge.  Regular is just too big for that super light flow day at the very end of my period.  5 stars all the way!  And how awesome is having tampons delivered right to your door?!  :-)"
58,58,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",ALOWEXH7NJVJB,Terrific Product,A terrific product that I\'ve utilized for what seems like a lifetime.  What a pleasure to have not paid for this product for once.
59,59,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",AIIR8E34EDKCQ,One of the better brands out there,"Tampax Pearl is way better than regular Tampax tampons, the applicator no longer feels like a torture device and they work great at night or during day, I also appreciate the different sizes even though I don\'t usually need other than regular, they\'re good to share if you have sisters and friends and there\'s nothing more annoying than running out, so this is great for stocking up.Just remember not to flush the applicator, plastic doesn\'t do well in the septic system :P"
60,60,20110914,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 14, 2011",A3FBM0RMCMAABV,Love the convenience,"My favorite thing about this box is the different sizes.  I was so happy when Tampax started packaging their tampons this way because at different times throughout my cycle I use different sizes.  I think most women do this, and normally we\'d have to buy 3 different boxes.  This box makes it so convenient with all three sizes included.  I love the ease of use too.  Tampax is the only brand I\'ll use."
66,66,20110908,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 8, 2011",A1WSQ0QRWQC7VI,i will say this,it\'s a tampon...it works but not s good as our usual brand. i like that it camewith a variety or absorbancy types in the same box but my daughter found them uncomfortable. personally i ouldn\'t buy this brand because it wasn\'t made or shaped the same way as our usual brand. i liked the quiet wrapper though.
70,70,20110907,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 7, 2011",A3FBMSWBJ202SF,Best tampons,"I tried the other brands and always came back to Tampax. It\'s so well designed in every single way. Obviously, a multi-pack is perfect for each period.The applicator is smooth and easy to use. The super ones are good for heavy days. Their super plus is even better for overnight/heavy flow.The environmental issue is the only flaw I\'d point out for it. Otherwise, I have been having wonderful experiences with Tampax for years."
74,74,20110904,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 4, 2011",A2BPB05QNCE00B,Love the multipack,"I\'ve been using Tampax for a while now. I love the plastic applicator on these. It makes it easier to put in. The best feature about this box is the fact that there are multiple absorbances. You get 30 Regulars, 10 light and 10 super which is the perfect amount of each in my opinion. This product offers great protection at an affordable price."
76,76,20110904,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 4, 2011",ALLHJD3KZF9KC,Not all products are made for everyone...,This review is not for the squeamish so let me warn you in advance.  I love the smooth plastic applicator but I too had a problem with these staying put.  I guess they are too smooth for me.  I have a heavy flow the first few days so I tried the super size first.  I had to wear a pad with it to contain the leaks.  I recently tried the OB brand super size and they are perfect for my heavy flow days.  They do not fall out and they contain the leaks like no other.  I did use this multipack for my lighter days and got by with just a pantiliner but I can not get past having them fall out when I go to relieve myself.  I do not like having tampons in my septic system and I do not want to have to fish them out.  I have had two children so maybe these would have worked better prior to childbirth.
78,78,20110902,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 2, 2011",A3AYF9CD4PXDJR,Well this is going to be an awkward review...,"I am not one to buy multi-packs, but I do like the idea. However, these tampons just didn\'t say put. It\'s likely they are too small for me (insert crass joke here). I am 35 but have not had a child. I used the \'Super\' ones (which are the biggest in this pack) and within an hour or so, they had just kinda worked their way out. Since the \'Super\' ones weren\'t cutting it, I know there\'s no way I can even try the smaller ones. Sadly, this box will be a waste for me.I do like the plastic applicator however. Packaging on this item is great."
81,81,20110830,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 30, 2011",A22I55P15NSAOX,Easy to use and the variety is useful.  Excellent protection.,"Although the plastic does generate more non biodegradable waste it makes the use of this product so much simpler, especially for girls just starting to use tampons.  Including various sizes means that you can select the minimum absorbency needed.  Although I tend to gravitate toward the cheaper (and more earth friendly) cardboard versions I do buy these Pearls for my daughter.  There is also a Lite compact version, which she favors for taking with her, as the size of the package is smaller and easier to slip into a pocket or purse.  If you put ease of use over cost then these are the tampons to buy. I highly suggest the Pearl versions for young girls."
83,83,20110828,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 28, 2011",A257XGMVGITLCT,TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS,"TAMPAX PEARL PLASTIC TRIPLE PACKHaving been a constant customer of Tampax brand tampons, I have told my daughter about these wonderful tampons -- it is her turn to carry the torch now that I am nearing sixty years of age!My daughter loves this tampon as much as I did.  The Tampax Pearl Plastics are new and improved over what I was using in the past.  There is now a clean guard layer that surrounds the core of the tampon giving the user that much needed extra layer of protection.  Also, there\'s a leak guard braid that helps to catch those pesky and embarrassing leaks.  These tampons are also form-fitting and conforms to each individual\'s unique shape.There is a smooth rounded plastic tip for easy and comfortable insertion and the plastic applicator has an anti-slip grip.  Also the wrapper is almost cute and has easy to open tabs.The best thing about this product -- besides all the added protection now available to users -- is being available in a box of fifty.  There are ten tampons for light days, thirty for regular usage, and then the ten super duper size needed for those extra heavy moments.My daughter swears by this product and will purchase no other.  She is a first grade teacher and doesn\'t get many bathroom breaks and is constantly on her feet.  She doesn\'t have to worry about leaking problems, feels comfortable and secure, and can have every size necessary for whatever protection she is seeking.An A+ on this product.Thank you!Pam"
84,84,20110828,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 28, 2011",A2J557IQKW3GCP,Absolute Favorite.,"I\'ve have tried so many tampons- because of price, quality- just always looking for a better product. But I always go back to Tampax Pearl. This is my absolute favorite tampon. It is a little higher priced than other products, but it is worth the extra cash. And I love this variety pack- what a great idea having three different absorbances in one pack. Perfect for me.There is only one con- this isn\'t an organic product, at all. I\'m hoping that in the future Tampax tries to incorporate that more into this product.Tampax Pearl tampons are the most comfortable and easy to use tampons out there. Not to mention the reliable protection. I highly recommend this product."
90,90,20110115,B001LK6XHC,5,"January 15, 2011",A21V0ZJE1UWI3A,love it!!,I myself have a gradual period and I don\'t know any other woman who doesn\'t. It\'s a great idea to include 3 different flow sizes in one box. Great!!
91,91,20120428,B001LK6XHW,2,"April 28, 2012",ATOW5T3WJJP0G,THEY DISAPPEAR?,"Lost third two after shoving first one up.  No need for fifty, thank you VERY, waste of steel.  Has no pearls, at ALL.  Does not light up, and is not magnetic enough.  Does not vibrate like my other four.  Also, my biggest problem has been smell.  Men run.  Run like my cat when he got out of the mattress.  Will not recommend to uncle."
94,94,20101207,B001LK6XHW,5,"December 7, 2010",A39CCCO2AA8238,"It works, period.","I will never switch brands again. I\'ve found the tampon that works for me. The magic little absorbent string saves your underpants from any little spots. Overall, these are comfortable and effective."
97,97,20120327,B001LK6XI6,1,"March 27, 2012",A1ZSP4WXA7DK97,why charge more than what i signed up for????,I AM NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT I AM BEEN CHARGE FOR THIS TAMPAX THE PRICE I ALWAYS PAY $7.32 OR NO MORE THAN $8.00 AND THIS TIME I AM BEEN CHARGE $10.17 THAT IS NOT THE PRICE THAT I SIGNED UP FOR THE AUTOMATIC SHIPMENT EVERY 3 MONTHS I DON\'T WANT THIS ITEM UNLESS IS THE PRICE THAT I WAS SIGN UP FOR. I SHOULD BE TOLD THE PRICE WENT UP BEFORE IT IS SHIPPED.
99,99,20111117,B001LK6XI6,5,"November 17, 2011",AVLTBIVBNEZOI,Great Buy,"Purchasing this product in bulk through Amazon is an excellent deal, especially when compared to the prices of smaller quantities sold at Walgreens and Target."
109,109,20101211,B001LK6XI6,5,"December 11, 2010",A3ASUD6GJ4INMV,My tampon of choice.,"I wasn\'t planning to review this since I figured that ladies have found their own favorite brand via trial and error (not to mention it\'s a bit awkward to review tampons), but come on!  No reviews yet?- I really like this applicator. Since it\'s a \'pearl\'-like plastic, it slides in easily and comfortably. I also find that it\'s easy to grip the tip while pushing the tampon in. With other brands, I can\'t get a good grip and just end up pushing the whole darn thing in.- Regular is the way to go, I find; I don\'t like the bulk of bigger tampons.- I feel more comfortable with unscented products. Granted, I\'ve never tried a scented one, but... I don\'t think there should be any perfuming going on down there.So yup.  I\'m pretty loyal to these. Available pretty much everywhere, fortunately."
112,112,20111223,B00284B56Y,5,"December 23, 2011",A32HBY12NEPGVK,Love these,"The tampons are the best I have ever used.  I like that they are compact and I can fit more in my purse.  To me they are also more comfortable to wear than the normal sized tampons.  I think the tampon itself is slightly shorter in length, but it still has the same absorbency.  The only drawback would be that the wrapper is very noisy."
114,114,20110802,B00284B56Y,5,"August 2, 2011",APXFAU4THTNFJ,I love it,"As a previous reviewer stated, we all generally know what works for us. I decided to try compaks because the packaging is so much smaller and as a college student living in a dorm room, I need to save as much space as possible (and save money!). It\'s difficult to find these in bulk anywhere but of course Amazon had them! My packaging has a different design though. Instead of a purse, its a giant heart. Anyone who doesn\'t know these are tampons won\'t know looking at the box unless they look at the back where there\'s an image of the applicator. I know that\'s not a huge issue but if something can be functional AND attractive to look at, I am all for it."
116,116,20110603,B00284B56Y,5,"June 3, 2011",A1LWRB6H39YVLA,Great price,"Great price to buy in bulk from here and not individually at the store. Saved a bundle of money, time, and effort by ordering these here."
119,119,20120411,B00284B59G,5,"April 11, 2012",A3PCTHR8IFEEYV,Absorbant Tampon!,"I am so glad to find a tampon that can absorb like this! Minimal leakage if any most of the time. I consider myself as having very heavy periods and I hadn\'t been able to find an effective tampon at the store. So I checked out amazon as I always do in times of need & bingo...with prime shipping, delivered the next day. I have since found these at target but love using the prime shipping & having the guarantee of quick delivery."
124,124,20120126,B00284B59G,5,"January 26, 2012",A2CT6DUIFOI2TZ,Life saver for women after babies!,Tampax has finally made a tampon for women!!! Women tend to have heavier periods after having children. These are a life saver. It is the ONLY tampon that has complete protection and able to take the extra flow. This is the next step if S or SP do not work for you. They are wider than SP and probably hold 75% more. I am very happy with the the Ultra tampons. Everyone I have recommended them to have been very happy.
127,127,20111222,B00284B59G,5,"December 22, 2011",A12ZDEYFMEWIZP,Highly Recommend now that OB Ultra is not available.,I would recommend this product to anyone that used to use the OB purple box Ultra.  Since they don\'t make that OB product now this works great!

As someone who ran out of the ob Ultra a few months ago and have been having a terrible time of it since, this is a Godsend.  I think this might even be better.  I might have to try their other sizes as well--since ob didn\'t have any loyalty to me, I no longer have any loyalty to them."

At least for the week or so each month you\'re on your period, like me, so about a 1/4 of your life!! Now, given, I only use them for a couple, maybe three days, but no more leaking after one hour, two, or even three! And, amazingly, they seem to be a better shape than the super (orange) pearls, so hold better and feel better, too. I used these for the first time in when I found them in Colorado and was thrilled. But, for the life of me, couldn\'t find them in California where I live (what, do the CA buyers think it\'s an \'altitude\' thing? CA buyers, get w/ the program!). Though I am not a regular Amazon shopper, I stumbled upon them and was thrilled at a good price, and TWO boxes. (trust me, you\'ll want two. Who wants to run out?) I hope other ladies who try them are as happy as I have been with the results. Don\'t ditch the liner or pad yet, but don\'t panic after 45 minutes either. Good luck!"
144,144,20100419,B0028916CC,5,"April 19, 2010",A2NKP3E5F90VFT,Almost Too Good,"As the box states, these are ULTRA absorbent. With the exception of the first 24 hours of my cycle, with these, I don\'t need to change as often. I feel \'ultra\' secure with these. For example, if I use one right before leaving the house, I feel confident that I can make it to my destination without having to RUSH to the nearest restroom or worry about \'accidents.\' Beware though, and don\'t get too overconfident in these. Especially during the early days, you still need to closely monitor yourself. BUT, these provide a lot more reassurance, and because you use fewer in the moderate to lighter days, you save money. They\'re really the only level of protection needed."

Sometimes the applicator wouldn\'t push through so I would have to push out the tampon a little before I tried to use it.The reason I do not use these anymore is because I\'ve had a dozen of these break from their wrappers when left in my purse.  I now use the regular tampons and I keep it in a tampon case.
