I have used Tampax for years and have never had any pain or health problems from their usage, and I will continue to use them till I no longer have a need for them.  Not only that, but the price for a box of 100 is excellent."
5,5,20110803,B001G7QJPG,5,"August 3, 2011",A250BWK8424ENU,Amazon shopping is the best!,The product itself most likely does not need to be reviewed as the brand alone is quality.  What I\'m reviewing is the true luxury and convenience of shopping at Amazon.com!  I\'m super busy working full-time and being pulled in many different directions - as I\'m sure many are - so ordering this type of product online has been wonderful.  It sure beats sending the hubby to the store and getting the mystery box when he returns!
8,8,20111128,B001G7QJQA,5,"November 28, 2011",ABZ8HUFDTASFZ,The Best Tampons. Period!,These are the best tampons I have ever used.  They are a bit more expensive but worth it. I recommend them all of the time.
10,10,20110826,B001G7QJQA,5,"August 26, 2011",A3AKI38YHMGOHX,The ONLY tampon I trust,I have very heavy flow days and so many other tampons have disappointed me. I buy very expensive panties and do not enjoy having to replace them because my tampon didnt hold up. These always work even on my heaviest days and they feel a lot more comfortable than other tampons.
11,11,20110313,B001G7QJQA,4,"March 13, 2011",A1NOEAO9V65ZAH,Good product.,"Welp- it\'s a tampon. What can I say. It works great, but occasionally I feel like stuff gets by on the lighter days- how that works I wouldn\'t even know. It does the job on heavy days. Case closed."
17,17,20110708,B001G7QRG2,5,"July 8, 2011",A2QNHF6YQIU82P,Tampax lites,I ordered the tampons from Amazon because it was cheaper than buying them in the store and they came right to my door for free.  Sweet!
22,22,20120216,B001G7QV1I,5,"February 16, 2012",A1UC50DYFPSXYD,These are the BEST!,"It\'s a weird to review a feminine hygeine product. Anyhow, I\'ve used these for twenty years. Love them. They are the most reliable tampons out there. I actually really like these better than the \'Tampax Pearl\' ones, as I can\'t stand the closed top and plastic applicator on the \'Pearl\'. These are my tried and true brand. I will never buy another. I also love the mix pack for the various stages of my cycle.I also am a subscribe & save fanatic! I save money, but I really just appreciate saving so much time by not having to go to the store. We always stock up on stuff and used to do so at a club store. Now we just use subscribe & save. On items like these, where you know you\'ll be buying them periodically for a long time, subscribe & save is awesome!"
24,24,20120110,B001G7QV1I,5,"January 10, 2012",A2JST3B1JUFH46,tampax,They get the job done. What else is there to say? I just wish I had gotten plastic instead of cardboard
25,25,20111103,B001G7QV1I,4,"November 3, 2011",A25GKR5BCDEON7,Good but bad.,I have recently decided to find the staple tampon brand that I will use for the rest of my period-having life and these may be it... I am also reducing my pad usage to nights when I will be asleep for a long time.  One of the main reasons is the flushable applicator.  I\'m no longer going to waste extra tissues wrapping the applicator up to hide in the trash.  And think about all the waste I am reducing.The only con about this would have to be the fact that they have blunt tips.  The cotton is exposed at the tip and it is not tapered.  It can be uncomfortable when inserting.
27,27,20100609,B001G7QV1I,2,"June 9, 2010",A1L8X5TUG6TIWX,An unnecessary new design ruined Tampax.,"I picked up a box assuming that this would be the same product I first tried several years ago... These are the worst tampons I\'ve used. You feel them after insertion. I kept going back to the bathroom because I felt like I needed to readjust. It never seemed to help. Very uncomfortable! Reviewers on drugstore.com have claimed that these actually gave them cramps. Ouch! The cardboard applicators, while being easier to manipulate than the nightmarish Playtex Beyond, can still be difficult. And I\'ve been flushing them with some apprehension even though the box says it\'s okay. Bad, bad, bad. They really effed up a classic brand here. Tampax tampons are inferior to just about every other tampon available now.Pearl is the only Tampax style worth considering...and even then there are cheaper and better tampons, such as Kotex Security, Playtex Gentle Glide, and Playtex Sport.I would only buy these again if absolutely nothing else were available to me."
29,29,20090212,B001GCU10U,3,"February 12, 2009",A2XNJJ9TF70P4J,"Good, but not great.","They are pretty comfortable, that\'s about it. Nothing amazing. Better than regular tampons. One thing I noticed is that the string always irritated me. By the end of my period I would always be irritated down there and I didn\'t know why. When I figured it out, I switched to Playtex Sport, BIG DIFFERENCE, Playtex Sport\'s are SO MUCH more comfortable and better than Tampax Pearl, and the string isn\'t irritating.Plus, one of my friends used to use Tampax Pearl\'s and the string came off and she couldn\'t get the tampon out."
30,30,20090109,B001GCU10U,5,"January 9, 2009",A215WH6RUDUCMP,Worth Every Cent,"My biggest gripe is they cost more than most, but really it is worth it.  The are very comfortable and the only brand I will buy now.  Highly recommended!"
32,32,20090517,B001H99ZCC,1,"May 17, 2009",A3U1VH6NJMLJLE,Sometimes Change is Not Good,"After faithfully using this product for 34 years, Tampax went and changed both the applicator and the tampon itself.  The applicator change was good...the tampon change was not.  I have never had so many problems as I do with this new version.  And, the price paid here was $6 higher than at Costco.  These I will donate to a women\'s shelter. My quest for either older versions of the product or a different brand that works continues."
34,34,20110806,B001K3IH06,3,"August 6, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Used to be my favorite- now not quite as comfortable,"I used to love these because they are the smallest tampon on the market and have a flushable applicator and wrapper.  Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion. Kotex is a reasonably priced brand that is more comfortable to remove than these."
37,37,20090407,B001K3IH06,5,"April 7, 2009",A1JTQCIL88W9JV,Hard to find item delivered to your door,"At the grocery or drugstore it is hard to find a box of \'slender\' only. Usually they are mixed in an assortment. For those with young daughters who want to avoid the whole pad thing, this is a great starter size. It is actually a regular, that has been slimmed down to an easier size for rookies. So pleased that Amazon stocks this item."
38,38,20120315,B001LK6XHC,5,"March 15, 2012",A3DZFEICHK5LF2,Works great!,"These work great. I\'ve actually bought these before, and bought them since.  I\'ve never had any irritation. This is my favorite brand.  Definitely recommend this!"
39,39,20120311,B001LK6XHC,5,"March 11, 2012",A31U7U4P1GVOVP,best i\'ve ever used!!,"Tampax Pearl is my go-to brand for Tampons. I\'ve tried many different brands/types but Tampax Pearl always comes out on top. The plastic applicators are much more comfortable to use than the cardboard applicators many other brands use. I love the multi-pack because I can choose which absorbancy will suit me best for that day without having to buy 3 separate boxes. I\'ve had problems with other tampons not fully opening up and absorbing like they are supposed to, but I\'ve never had a problem with these (or a leak!). I would definitely recommend that if you haven\'t tried these already, you should. You won\'t regret it."
42,42,20111222,B001LK6XHC,5,"December 22, 2011",A2GQ0WGM9BYX9O,MUCH needed variety and comfort,"We women know how it is, and to spare myself the agony of writing about something so personal I will keep this short: this is a great and economical buy for the main reason that your days vary and so will the amount of protection from mishaps you require. So Here are fifty tampons, 30 of the ones that are most commonly used for women with a regular cycle, ten for before and after the main part of it for the heaviest and lightest days. I will ALWAYS buy this pack from now on cause there is nothing worse than the dread that hits you when you don\'t have one when you need one and you\'re taken by surprise and duckwalking down the hall, now is there?  LMFAO!"
47,47,20110929,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 29, 2011",A4SD8F79JBYG2,The best,"I\'m in my early 40s and have been using tampons since I was 13, so I\'ve had lots of experience with different brands. I think I\'ve tried them all. These are, without doubt, THE VERY BEST. This package of assorted sizes is handy."
48,48,20110929,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 29, 2011",A3EKLO0WDCM01F,The best,"Okay so it may be a mildly awkward review to write, but women are the ones who have to go through this ordeal every month and thus have to purchase the proper products, so that\'s that.I would never use anything else.  These have a plastic applicator which is the savior right there.  Even hearing the term \'cardboard applicator\' conjures up images of olden times (like the 1800s) in my head.  I know it\'s a matter of preference but in terms of comfort I have no idea why someone would elect cardboard over plastic, but that\'s just me.The price of these on Amazon is great, especially with the Subscribe & Save program.  It\'s a perfect deal.  I only wish that they made a 50 count pack of regular & super without the light ones as I never need those."
51,51,20110924,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 24, 2011",A2OJCTT5WLB2HR,Hmm... How to review tampons...,"This should be a fun review.Over the years, I was not a big fan of Tampax tampons because the style made them get longer instead of wider once they started absorbing.  They changed that design with Tampax Pearl and now I really like them.  I loved the large pack with many different sizes and felt that the number of each size was quite good.  I had no issues with the size of the tampons or absorbency and found them to be comfortable and effective which is really about all I can ask of a tampon!"
66,66,20110908,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 8, 2011",A1WSQ0QRWQC7VI,i will say this,it\'s a tampon...it works but not s good as our usual brand. i like that it camewith a variety or absorbancy types in the same box but my daughter found them uncomfortable. personally i ouldn\'t buy this brand because it wasn\'t made or shaped the same way as our usual brand. i liked the quiet wrapper though.
71,71,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A2RX62V4E2BF5Z,I\'ll always be a Tampax Girl,"Tampax has always been my first choice tampon. I normally go with the normal Tampax, not the Pearl line. There are a few \'upgrades\' with the Pearl line, in addition to the quality and protection you know and trust from Tampax.Instead of the traditional paper wrap, these are in an easy to open plastic wrap. Tampax calls these purse-friendly, and indeed they are. We\'ve all found that torn open, slightly disassembled tampon at the bottom of our purse. You won\'t have that problem with the Pearl line. The multi-pack, for me, always runs out of mediums and leaves me with only the barely useful light and the super absorbency is just scary big.The blunt cardboard applicator has been replaced with a \'smooth plastic applicator and rounded tip for comfortable insertion\'. I won\'t say you can\'t tell the difference, but chances are you won\'t care. The difference is so insignificant that I don\'t find it worth the additional cost, both financially and to the environment. That is pretty much the story of the Pearl line. Like with the absorbent braid, I don\'t koow that the ever so slight amount of additional protection will ever, in your life, make even the slightest difference.The Pearl line, like the normal Tampax line, is great. For me, I\'ll stick with the less expensive, paper wrapped, cardboard applicators. BUT, if the added feature seem like they would make a difference to you, then go for Pearl."
73,73,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A25RTRAPQAJBDJ,Great product.,My girlfriend says \'I love the variety pack of tampons! They come with enough of each absorption amount so that I always have what I need.  I have always loved the Tampax Pearl and would recommend them highly. The convenience of the variety pack is great!\'
76,76,20110904,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 4, 2011",ALLHJD3KZF9KC,Not all products are made for everyone...,This review is not for the squeamish so let me warn you in advance.  I love the smooth plastic applicator but I too had a problem with these staying put.  I guess they are too smooth for me.  I have a heavy flow the first few days so I tried the super size first.  I had to wear a pad with it to contain the leaks.  I recently tried the OB brand super size and they are perfect for my heavy flow days.  They do not fall out and they contain the leaks like no other.  I did use this multipack for my lighter days and got by with just a pantiliner but I can not get past having them fall out when I go to relieve myself.  I do not like having tampons in my septic system and I do not want to have to fish them out.  I have had two children so maybe these would have worked better prior to childbirth.
78,78,20110902,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 2, 2011",A3AYF9CD4PXDJR,Well this is going to be an awkward review...,"I am not one to buy multi-packs, but I do like the idea. However, these tampons just didn\'t say put. It\'s likely they are too small for me (insert crass joke here). I am 35 but have not had a child. I used the \'Super\' ones (which are the biggest in this pack) and within an hour or so, they had just kinda worked their way out. Since the \'Super\' ones weren\'t cutting it, I know there\'s no way I can even try the smaller ones. Sadly, this box will be a waste for me.I do like the plastic applicator however. Packaging on this item is great."
79,79,20110901,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 1, 2011",A36AIK1DQPSRNT,***A FAV PERSONAL PRODUCT****,"These are my favorites.  The assorted absorbency is a great idea, the plastic applicator allows for ease of use, and the large amount, at least in my case, means that they will last a while.  Not much more to say about a product like this and have it remain a rated G review!DYB"
84,84,20110828,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 28, 2011",A2J557IQKW3GCP,Absolute Favorite.,"I\'ve have tried so many tampons- because of price, quality- just always looking for a better product. But I always go back to Tampax Pearl. This is my absolute favorite tampon. It is a little higher priced than other products, but it is worth the extra cash. And I love this variety pack- what a great idea having three different absorbances in one pack. Perfect for me.There is only one con- this isn\'t an organic product, at all. I\'m hoping that in the future Tampax tries to incorporate that more into this product.Tampax Pearl tampons are the most comfortable and easy to use tampons out there. Not to mention the reliable protection. I highly recommend this product."
85,85,20110825,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 25, 2011",ACEA95FQS1AVP,convenient multi-pack,"I usually use Playtex tampons, mainly because they have a large multi-pack and plastic applciators.  So, when I saw that Tampax was offering a similar product, I decided to try it.  I find both products protect equally well (anyway, they are all limited by regulations on how absorbant they can be due to that Rely scare years ago), so it really comes down to price and convenience.  This box has a good assortment with 10 lites, 10 super and the largest portion of regulars - which will probably suit most women.  The price via the Amazon Subscribe and Save is very reasonable (and much cheaper than my grocery store), and definitely convenient being delivered right to your door.  I don\'t have to worry about running out, and for some women who are uncomfortable buying them in stores this is a great alternative.Overall, a good reiable product from a reputable brand at a reasonable price.  Recommended."

Does not light up, and is not magnetic enough.  Does not vibrate like my other four.  Also, my biggest problem has been smell.  Men run.  Run like my cat when he got out of the mattress.  Will not recommend to uncle."
96,96,20120405,B001LK6XI6,5,"April 5, 2012",AHUJB9FTS71RE,Great,"What I love about these:- Not too drying- Just the right size- Right amount of absorbency- Applicator is easy.I wish I didn\'t have to buy these, of course, but since I do, I am glad to have these as an option!"
98,98,20120119,B001LK6XI6,5,"January 19, 2012",AQVNYKMK0E63B,Subscribe & Save: This is a good deal!,I used these tampons for the first time back in August and I was very pleased. I think these are good for regular flow. I have used the light ones but the leak but these are just right.
102,102,20110811,B001LK6XI6,5,"August 11, 2011",A1FOX093BGKU3U,Best ever,This is the best tampon i have ever used. Very comfortable and easy to use. Glad it is available online and thanks for the fast delivery
103,103,20110803,B001LK6XI6,4,"August 3, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Good tampons but wouldn\'t buy on a regular basis,"In general, these are good tampons, easy to insert and comfortable. I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."
110,110,20120117,B00284B56Y,1,"January 17, 2012",ATMMHGCOW9BDV,Horrible,"I absolutely HATE these tampons. It\'s irritating that it\'s impossible to find light tampons anywhere, which is why I decided to try these. First of all, the applicator is pretty crappy and can be painful. It\'s not very smoothe at all and the actual tampons get super long and kinda huge once they\'re inside and that was really painful for me. Because of how weird and long they get, they would start to come out (without even having absorbed anything yet!) and rub weird and hurt even more :/"
113,113,20110821,B00284B56Y,5,"August 21, 2011",A22I55P15NSAOX,These are the ones for your daughter to try as first tampons.,These are the ones for your young daughter to try to use when she first starts learning to use a tampon.  The plastic makes them easier to insert (also buy her some lubricant and have her stand up with her foot up on the toilet or even higher ).  The \'lip\' at the edge of the tampon makes it easier to grip as well. The LITES are smaller and easier for a young girl to use. The small size and individual wrapping makes them easy to put in a pocket.Use your own judgement to make sure that she is mature enough to remember to remove them at regular intervals.  But if she participates in sports/swimming/dance having this option is invaluable so that she can participate in her normal activities.
115,115,20110710,B00284B56Y,1,"July 10, 2011",ACXCMZQ6H1DUA,Don\'t buy these!,Buy the competitor brand in the black box.  These are so useless; they only get longer instead of expanding all around.  Major leaks!

These have helped me to do my job, only going to the bathroom every 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  I used to get them from Sam\'s Club, but they no longer sell them.  I am very thankful that I can get them here, on Amazon."

The size and absorbency seems to be comparable, and I am able to make it through the night with these.  I am sad to be putting the plastic of the applicator into the landfill, but happy that I know I\'m 46 and only have a few years to go.  I do miss the convenience of being able to put the ob\'s in my pocket.  Hopefully someone will see the need of a tampon like the ob ultra."

I was curious because Tampax never made an Ultra before and I was panicked because I have Fibroids and need these tampons.  Tampax Ultra is just superb and I bought a two pack of 36 before and this is my second order. You can\'t even find a 36 count in the stores in NYC.  At least I\'ve never spotted them only in 18 count and expensive.  I get a bargain through Amazon.  This is my lifeling purchase.

I was so disappointed to find that OB stopped making their ultra tampon but I need to find something that was could absorb and I lucky found these at Walmart and now nothing can compare to them. They work really well and I never have to worry about embarassing leakage or anything. These are wonderful and I was so happy to find that I can now get them on Amazon, is there nothing that you can\'t get here!"

Women tend to have heavier periods after having children.  These are a life saver.  It is the ONLY tampon that has complete protection and able to take the extra flow.  This is the next step if S or SP do not work for you.  They are wider than SP and probably hold 75% more.  I am very happy with the the Ultra tampons.  Everyone I have recommended them to have been very happy.
149,149,20111103,B0029NYQQA,3,"November 3, 2011",A25GKR5BCDEON7,These use to be my favorite.,These use to be the only tampons I would buy because of their obvious compactness.  Sometimes the applicator wouldn\'t push through so I would have to push out the tampon a little before I tried to use it.The reason I do not use these anymore is because I\'ve had a dozen of these break from their wrappers when left in my purse.  I now use the regular tampons and I keep it in a tampon case.

Although, dont expect to hear a click more like feel it with your fingers. You dont have to push it in until you hear the click either. If its in all the way just pull out the barrel like you would do a normal Tampon. These are really small & cute. The boxes are discreet. The first few times you might leak a little bit but once you get the hang of using these, it will be alright. As every woman knows, you can always wear a little pad to help with the leaks. =)"
