3,3,20110628,B000GCNBOO,5,"June 28, 2011",A2PNAN94Q7P5FG,Travel size!,I bought this little box to keep in my camper.. I plan on buying more and keeping them in all my cars too.It is the perfect size to have as a back up!
5,5,20110803,B001G7QJPG,5,"August 3, 2011",A250BWK8424ENU,Amazon shopping is the best!,The product itself most likely does not need to be reviewed as the brand alone is quality.  What I\'m reviewing is the true luxury and convenience of shopping at Amazon.com!  I\'m super busy working full-time and being pulled in many different directions - as I\'m sure many are - so ordering this type of product online has been wonderful.  It sure beats sending the hubby to the store and getting the mystery box when he returns!
16,16,20111027,B001G7QRG2,5,"October 27, 2011",A132I7J24U5DKW,The lighter side of...  well you know...,"Don\'t you just love that tampon companies seem to think we only need a few light tampons?  Well, that is what it seems to me.  They put perhaps 4 or 8 of these in the multi-packs and make the stand alone lights hard to find and in small quantities.  I find I use lots of Ultras the first part of the period, a bit of the super and regular absorbancy for a short time in the middle and then lots of lights at the very end.  So a multi-pack with mostly Regulars does not help me much.I have used these and the Pearl version and find they both work very similarly, except these are a bit more ego-friend;y with cardboard applicators.  I have to be honest, these are the only size I buy with cardboard, any other absorbancy is a bit uncomfortable for me.  I go through the most of these anyways and it takes a bit of the cost down.Why not get these in bulk?  I always say, if you will need it anyways and it doesn\'t expire, get a bunch at a great price and be prepared!"
17,17,20110708,B001G7QRG2,5,"July 8, 2011",A2QNHF6YQIU82P,Tampax lites,I ordered the tampons from Amazon because it was cheaper than buying them in the store and they came right to my door for free.  Sweet!
29,29,20090212,B001GCU10U,3,"February 12, 2009",A2XNJJ9TF70P4J,"Good, but not great.","They are pretty comfortable, that\'s about it. Nothing amazing. Better than regular tampons. One thing I noticed is that the string always irritated me. By the end of my period I would always be irritated down there and I didn\'t know why. When I figured it out, I switched to Playtex Sport, BIG DIFFERENCE, Playtex Sport\'s are SO MUCH more comfortable and better than Tampax Pearl, and the string isn\'t irritating.Plus, one of my friends used to use Tampax Pearl\'s and the string came off and she couldn\'t get the tampon out."
33,33,20120425,B001H9PUR6,5,"April 25, 2012",A3Q3ZOIIXVKWQF,great product and fast shipping,"3 days from order to UPS receipt at my door.  I have always had a problem buying feminine hygiene products from  the drug store or supermarket, especially in such a quantity. I just find it embarrassing, though it only makes sense to  buy in quantity something you know you will use and save money.Amazon and associated merchants have always been great.  Most of the time I have just bought books. But recently have been buying clothes as well as other products. And even with shipping costs find I can get things cheaper than at local stores.Only bad thing is these have plastic insertion. Not that good for the environment but sure makes insertion much easier."
35,35,20110708,B001K3IH06,5,"July 8, 2011",A2QNHF6YQIU82P,Tampax Slender Regular tampons,"I like the slender tampons because they have the same absorbency as the regular-sized ones but go in a little more easily, especially if you have a light flow and have trouble getting another tampon in when you have just removed one.  Amazon\'s price was better than I can get in the grocery store, plus they don\'t always have this size available there.  I also got free shipping, so I had nothing to lose."
38,38,20120315,B001LK6XHC,5,"March 15, 2012",A3DZFEICHK5LF2,Works great!,"These work great. I\'ve actually bought these before, and bought them since.  I\'ve never had any irritation. This is my favorite brand.  Definitely recommend this!"
39,39,20120311,B001LK6XHC,5,"March 11, 2012",A31U7U4P1GVOVP,best i\'ve ever used!!,"Tampax Pearl is my go-to brand for Tampons. I\'ve tried many different brands/types but Tampax Pearl always comes out on top. The plastic applicators are much more comfortable to use than the cardboard applicators many other brands use. I love the multi-pack because I can choose which absorbancy will suit me best for that day without having to buy 3 separate boxes. I\'ve had problems with other tampons not fully opening up and absorbing like they are supposed to, but I\'ve never had a problem with these (or a leak!). I would definitely recommend that if you haven\'t tried these already, you should. You won\'t regret it."
46,46,20110930,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 30, 2011",A38QHZEEYZKT27,"My wife\'s favorite, beats going to the store","I imagine at this point most women know which Tampons they like, and there\'s really no substitute for trying them for real.  That being said, my wife only uses these.  I can really only review the packaging here, which is probably what you want to know about.  It\'s a multi-pack, containing 10 light and 10 super, and 30 of the regular size tampons.  It\'s a great assortment and last several cycles.  The price, as is usual around here, is excellent.  Save yourself some time and money if this is your brand and get them here."
48,48,20110929,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 29, 2011",A3EKLO0WDCM01F,The best,"Okay so it may be a mildly awkward review to write, but women are the ones who have to go through this ordeal every month and thus have to purchase the proper products, so that\'s that.I would never use anything else.  These have a plastic applicator which is the savior right there.  Even hearing the term \'cardboard applicator\' conjures up images of olden times (like the 1800s) in my head.  I know it\'s a matter of preference but in terms of comfort I have no idea why someone would elect cardboard over plastic, but that\'s just me.The price of these on Amazon is great, especially with the Subscribe & Save program.  It\'s a perfect deal.  I only wish that they made a 50 count pack of regular & super without the light ones as I never need those."
51,51,20110924,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 24, 2011",A2OJCTT5WLB2HR,Hmm... How to review tampons...,"This should be a fun review.Over the years, I was not a big fan of Tampax tampons because the style made them get longer instead of wider once they started absorbing.  They changed that design with Tampax Pearl and now I really like them.  I loved the large pack with many different sizes and felt that the number of each size was quite good.  I had no issues with the size of the tampons or absorbency and found them to be comfortable and effective which is really about all I can ask of a tampon!"
54,54,20110920,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 20, 2011",A3CHMHGSJSQ02J,Good multipack,"Like many reviewers have said, this multipack has just the right mix of sizes/absorbencies for the average woman. One of the things I normally don\'t like about plastic-applicator tampons is the heavy fragrance/scent. It just seems unhealthy to me, and it\'s one of the reasons I prefer cardboard applicators. The Unscented tampons here are a great idea. The plastic applicator is also easier to use than others I\'ve tried, which are always much too thin in the \'grip\' area, causing (TMI ALERT) painful stabbing and pinching.I\'ll probably gravitate back to my usual cardboard Tampax, but this product is definitely a good value for those who prefer plastic."
55,55,20110917,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 17, 2011",AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,Works as Designed,"This is obviously a review written by wife for the ladies:When it comes to that time of the month, I am not devoted to any one product.  Really, I see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for because the costs for feminine hygiene products are getting up there.  I never tried the Tampax Pearls because they are usually the most expensive box.  I thought I would give it a shot.  The applicator is very smooth and easy to insert unlike the cardboard applicators.  Obviously, this isn\'t good for the environment but I prefer these over the flushable applicators that usually clog my toilet.  The insert itself is comfortable enough.  I was skeptical of the braided string, however, I learned the hard way that the braid really does help with some leaks.  The issue I have, as I am sure many woman do, is the number of tampons included in each absorbancy.  I like the multipak idea but I am always left with a lot of one absorbancy over another."
58,58,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",ALOWEXH7NJVJB,Terrific Product,A terrific product that I\'ve utilized for what seems like a lifetime.  What a pleasure to have not paid for this product for once.
62,62,20110914,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 14, 2011",AC11GZAL5N99C,Pearls,"Overall, the brand is wonderful. The one major thing I don\'t like is the plastic applicators as they are not green friendly. Multipacks like this one may not suit your flow, but there\'s enough of each to possibly get you through two months or so without having to pick up additional boxes."
63,63,20110913,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 13, 2011",A2M14CFAMF8J7I,A snug and absorbent fit,"I\'ve tried different kinds of Tampax for years, but always find them too long. So until now, my favorite brand it has been O.B. After trying Tampax Pearl Plastic, I\'m switching brands. I like the comfortable plastic applicator more, and Tampax Pearl are a snug and absorbent fit. I like the size assortment in this box, but  I will buy a box of Tampax Pearl Super Absorbency for the heavy days, and keep these for the days where my period fluctuates."
64,64,20110913,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 13, 2011",A11IKWE7B29TOJ,"Not Bad, But I Wouldn\'t Switch From My Regular Brand","I\'m a Playtex girl through and through. No idea how I got started buying the Playtex brand, but I\'ve stuck to it for about 12 years now. I was open to trying Pearl because a) the Tampax name is a good one, b) I love the idea of Pearl- the word just sounds nice and comfortable, and c) How different can tampons be, anyway?These tampons weren\'t bad, but they also weren\'t quite as comfortable as my regular Playtex (Gentle Glide, in case you\'re wondering). They seemed a little cheaper and the actual tampon definitely wasn\'t as sturdy and ended up actually falling apart a bit.Oh, but I am a fan of the super to easy open packaging. I just don\'t think I\'d replace my Playtex for these.And this is officially the most awkward Amazon review I\'ve written...."
72,72,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",ALBW2ZBS6Z2AY,BEST TAMPONS EVER,"These are now my new favorites.I had previously tried a store brand version of the \' Pearl\' that was quite inferior, so be sure to get the real thing.The applicator has a nice shape, the braided part of the string prevents leaks, and unlike many tampons, the absorbency is not exaggerated.I also like the combination of 3 different sizes in this box, which is quite large and will keep you prepared for at  least several months.A product with no drawbacks that I sincerely recommend."
78,78,20110902,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 2, 2011",A3AYF9CD4PXDJR,Well this is going to be an awkward review...,"I am not one to buy multi-packs, but I do like the idea. However, these tampons just didn\'t say put. It\'s likely they are too small for me (insert crass joke here). I am 35 but have not had a child. I used the \'Super\' ones (which are the biggest in this pack) and within an hour or so, they had just kinda worked their way out. Since the \'Super\' ones weren\'t cutting it, I know there\'s no way I can even try the smaller ones. Sadly, this box will be a waste for me.I do like the plastic applicator however. Packaging on this item is great."
83,83,20110828,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 28, 2011",A257XGMVGITLCT,TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS,"TAMPAX PEARL PLASTIC TRIPLE PACKHaving been a constant customer of Tampax brand tampons, I have told my daughter about these wonderful tampons -- it is her turn to carry the torch now that I am nearing sixty years of age!My daughter loves this tampon as much as I did.  The Tampax Pearl Plastics are new and improved over what I was using in the past.  There is now a clean guard layer that surrounds the core of the tampon giving the user that much needed extra layer of protection.  Also, there\'s a leak guard braid that helps to catch those pesky and embarrassing leaks.  These tampons are also form-fitting and conforms to each individual\'s unique shape.There is a smooth rounded plastic tip for easy and comfortable insertion and the plastic applicator has an anti-slip grip.  Also the wrapper is almost cute and has easy to open tabs.The best thing about this product -- besides all the added protection now available to users -- is being available in a box of fifty.  There are ten tampons for light days, thirty for regular usage, and then the ten super duper size needed for those extra heavy moments.My daughter swears by this product and will purchase no other.  She is a first grade teacher and doesn\'t get many bathroom breaks and is constantly on her feet.  She doesn\'t have to worry about leaking problems, feels comfortable and secure, and can have every size necessary for whatever protection she is seeking.An A+ on this product.Thank you!Pam"
86,86,20110822,B001LK6XHC,4,"August 22, 2011",A17O9AHKHK66AI,Gold Standard for Protection,"This product offers the most reliable protection of any I have used.  It\'s also the easiest to use.  I wish it were made of organic, unbleached cotton and that the applicator were made of biodegradable plastic.  The unnecessarily harsh environmental impact of the product is why I rated it four stars instead of five and is also the reason I do not use these all the time.  However, if I am in a situation in which I would not otherwise be able to leave my house, this is the product on which I rely."
92,92,20110803,B001LK6XHW,4,"August 3, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Good tampons but wouldn\'t buy on a regular basis,"In general, these are good tampons, easy to insert and comfortable. I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."

100,100,20111024,B001LK6XI6,5,"October 24, 2011",A3INPNIL5AIDPJ,easy and affordable,This is a great and affordable way to get an item that everyone dreads to go buy!  I like that it is sent straight to my door and my kids don\'t even see them!  Buying this way was also a cheaper price than our local Wal-Mart store.
105,105,20110610,B001LK6XI6,5,"June 10, 2011",A3Q6SXPO43N4CL,Happy & Loyal Customer,I\'ve used these exclusively for a few years now and am very happy with them compared to any other tampon I have tried.  Am very happy with the decision to use the subscribe & save feature.
106,106,20110508,B001LK6XI6,5,"May 8, 2011",AY08S9OMRZV8V,Won\'t spend money on any other tampon.,I have tried different brands of tampons with different aplicators. I this is my most preferred tampon. It is very easy to use.. I love that it glides well and that the opening of the applicator has a more rounded design so that it doesn\'t cause discomfort when being used.
110,110,20120117,B00284B56Y,1,"January 17, 2012",ATMMHGCOW9BDV,Horrible,"I absolutely HATE these tampons. It\'s irritating that it\'s impossible to find light tampons anywhere, which is why I decided to try these. First of all, the applicator is pretty crappy and can be painful. It\'s not very smoothe at all and the actual tampons get super long and kinda huge once they\'re inside and that was really painful for me. Because of how weird and long they get, they would start to come out (without even having absorbed anything yet!) and rub weird and hurt even more :/"
112,112,20111223,B00284B56Y,5,"December 23, 2011",A32HBY12NEPGVK,Love these,"The tampons are the best I have ever used.  I like that they are compact and I can fit more in my purse.  To me they are also more comfortable to wear than the normal sized tampons.  I think the tampon itself is slightly shorter in length, but it still has the same absorbency.  The only drawback would be that the wrapper is very noisy."
114,114,20110802,B00284B56Y,5,"August 2, 2011",APXFAU4THTNFJ,I love it,"As a previous reviewer stated, we all generally know what works for us. I decided to try compaks because the packaging is so much smaller and as a college student living in a dorm room, I need to save as much space as possible (and save money!). It\'s difficult to find these in bulk anywhere but of course Amazon had them! My packaging has a different design though. Instead of a purse, its a giant heart. Anyone who doesn\'t know these are tampons won\'t know looking at the box unless they look at the back where there\'s an image of the applicator. I know that\'s not a huge issue but if something can be functional AND attractive to look at, I am all for it."

119,119,20120411,B00284B59G,5,"April 11, 2012",A3PCTHR8IFEEYV,Absorbant Tampon!,"I am so glad to find a tampon that can absorb like this! Minimal leakage if any most of the time. I consider myself as having very heavy periods and I hadn\'t been able to find an effective tampon at the store. So I checked out amazon as I always do in times of need & bingo...with prime shipping, delivered the next day. I have since found these at target but love using the prime shipping & having the guarantee of quick delivery."

These have helped me to do my job, only going to the bathroom every 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  I used to get them from Sam\'s Club, but they no longer sell them.  I am very thankful that I can get them here, on Amazon."
126,126,20111228,B00284B59G,5,"December 28, 2011",A2TSGCYUT950YD,Perfect if you have a heavy flow,"These hold up for about five hours on my heaviest days; with the super-plus, I bleed through after 2-3 hours, tops. I had never heard of ultra-absorbency tampons, let alone seen any in stores in my area, so I was glad to find these as an \'also bought\' item on amazon.com when I searched for Tampax super-plus. After trying these, I can say I\'m a customer until menopause. I have never, ever sprung a leak with these. Don\'t hesitate to buy these if you bleed heavily - as of right now, there is no other Ultra tampon on the market."
129,129,20111025,B00284B59G,5,"October 25, 2011",AUFB3GQJV10P0,Award winner,After I could no longer find OB Ultra I went to this.  I was curious because Tampax never made an Ultra before and I was panicked because I have Fibroids and need these tampons.  Tampax Ultra is just superb and I bought a two pack of 36 before and this is my second order. You can\'t even find a 36 count in the stores in NYC.  At least I\'ve never spotted them only in 18 count and expensive.  I get a bargain through Amazon.  This is my lifeling purchase.

Lets you not have to be constantly changing and away from whatever long activity. Great for travel or a full day at the amusement park or a long hike!!!

Enough that I broke through a Super Plus tampon onto a full-sized pad every 1-2 hours for about one day. I tried the Tampax Pearl Ultra as a sample and have been buying them ever since, they are great! They have given me the freedom again not to be tied to the nearest bathroom. It is also great being able to order them from Amazon since not many retailers carry them in my area. Don\'t forget to see if there is an Amazon coupon. I got an additional discount both times I ordered from Amazon. Thank you Tampax. Thank you Amazon."

I was so disappointed to find that OB stopped making their ultra tampon but I need to find something that was could absorb and I lucky found these at Walmart and now nothing can compare to them. They work really well and I never have to worry about embarassing leakage or anything. These are wonderful and I was so happy to find that I can now get them on Amazon, is there nothing that you can\'t get here!"

Women tend to have heavier periods after having children.  These are a life saver.  It is the ONLY tampon that has complete protection and able to take the extra flow.  This is the next step if S or SP do not work for you.  They are wider than SP and probably hold 75% more.  I am very happy with the the Ultra tampons.  Everyone I have recommended them to have been very happy.

Just keep them in the saved-for-later part of your cart to monitor the price as your refill date approaches (or manually control the subscription deliveries)."

Sometimes the applicator wouldn\'t push through so I would have to push out the tampon a little before I tried to use it.The reason I do not use these anymore is because I\'ve had a dozen of these break from their wrappers when left in my purse.  I now use the regular tampons and I keep it in a tampon case.

Although, dont expect to hear a click more like feel it with your fingers. You dont have to push it in until you hear the click either. If its in all the way just pull out the barrel like you would do a normal Tampon. These are really small & cute. The boxes are discreet. The first few times you might leak a little bit but once you get the hang of using these, it will be alright. As every woman knows, you can always wear a little pad to help with the leaks. =)"

And why is it so hard to find cardboard applicators in Safeway? Oh well now that I know I can get them on Amazon I\'ll always get them here. Each plastic applicator will still be in this world way after you\'re long gone. Do you really need that? No you don\'t, so buy cardboard it works just as well!"
