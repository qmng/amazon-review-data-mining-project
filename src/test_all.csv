The shipping is FAST! I got it after I placed the order two or three days after. The overnight Always is incredible. It is very long but you will still feel very comfortable since it is very thin. It gives you 100% protection at night and even day time. The price is very reasonable as well. I usually buy it online but now I am considering to get it from this website. Great product.

I\'m not sure who they had in mind when they designed these.  Obviously not adult women.But they will probably do okay on non-period days.

Many years ago, I found pads by Always that were geared for women who wear sizes 14 and up -- and have since had difficulty being able to consistently find them.The difference is that the pads for sizes 14 and up are longer and offer more protection. I found that Overnight pads are about the same length, and can be helpful in a pinch. But this review is not about the pads.Over the last few years, I have been fortunate enough to lose some weight, and with it, find myself with a generally lighter flow. Pads can get costly, especially when they are barely used, and I found the Always Pantyliners, which did me decently well.The last time I needed pads and liners, I found myself (newly unemployed) in sticker-shock at the drugstore. Sometimes, I guess we forget just how much the odds and ends cost when we\'re not thinking about money. So I came to Amazon, and in looking for my products, found the Always Pantyliner - made for sizes 14 and up. I did not know this existed, but I quickly decided to go ahead and make the purchase in liu of the regular pantyliner.The size is slightly longer and wider, and I am so much more comfortable that there is more coverage. I\'m glad Always has taken larger women into consideration, and every plus size woman should know that there is a product out there to protect her, too!"

The other ones are too long and bother her.  The problem was that our local stores stopped carrying them for some reason.  (I ordered 6 packages in case they are stopping production or something. I would have ordered more, but I have no where to store them.) My 10 year old just started her period.  These fit her way better than the other pads as well.  I wish that these came in a higher absorbency in the slender (shorter) size for when they have heavy flows and for overnight.  If anyone finds them anywhere I\'d love to get some."

83,83,83,20090814,B0029NYPXO,4,"August 14, 2009",A1TRZMZ22NMDZU,Best for Travel,"These are single-pack wipes that provide extra cleansing when dry toilet paper isn\'t enough. They are comparable to other wipes, but as others have noted on reviews, they are quite narrow.  This allows one to get one good front to back swipe if holding the wipe lengthwise over the hand. May need two depending on amount of cleaning desired. I bought these mainly to have a portable wipe for work, when forced to use public restrooms (never know if there will be TP once you get in the stall!), or any other time away from home. 4 stars only because I do not particularly care for the added fragrance, and would prefer an adult \'baby wipe\' that is more gentle for sensitive areas. Also wish they would offer a refillable tub option for home, because I do like the product; however, would like less packaging waste when unnecessary."
91,91,91,20101206,B0029NYPY8,5,"December 6, 2010",AL77KF4YQVL78,Fresh and Clean,"Always Feminine Wipes are one of my favorite luxuries. Even the softest toilet paper doesn\'t compare to how gently this cleans and refreshes. I prefer Always to other brands because some of the others would dry up and others seemed soggy so, after using it, I had to crouch there for a while to air dry before pulling up my panties. Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient."

97,97,97,20110719,B0029NYPZ2,5,"July 19, 2011",A2V9DTXTQ5YIMK,Great price and product,"I saw these at a local discount store for almost $4 a tub. Knowing you are receiving 4 of them is a steal! Without getting too personal, these are great to use when you have your period or are having any female issues which require a little extra care and cleaning. I have always had heavy periods and would just wet toilet paper. This takes that away and also holds up well and does not tear. Not only is the price great but the quality is great too, not too thin but also not too thick. I will be keeping these as a subscribe and save. Also, the scent is very mild and not overwhelming. I had a c-section months ago and after had to use Charmin moist wipes which cost a lot more and did not smell as good. I am so glad I found these. I also have been using Always pads/panty liners for years so I know they have quality products. As usually, Amazon wins with the price and product."

The container is good because it helps to preserve the liquid in the wipes without drying out. I use these quite often when I need to feel fresh after using the bathroom. Because i like it so much, I bought the To Go ones as well.For anyone who is worried about possible infections, that was my original worry at first, but I\'ve had no problem at all.I would definitely recommend this to anyone."

Product arrived in a timely fashion and as described.  This product, IMHO is the best overnite protection available.  Nothing I\'ve ever used before these worked as well, absorbed as much or was easy on my skin as these. Would buy again and again."

I\'ve used them for two months and have found them to be non-obsorbent. They\'re also too slender, except in the back. I can\'t count how many accidents I\'ve had while wearing them. I would never buy them again. I\'m sticking with Always Ultra Thins and the regular thick pad in the blue bag."

And with these you don\'t feel gross, you\'re extremely comfortable, and they do absorb a lot more than the others. I still leak, but not as much. They\'re definitely not perfect, the wings are a bit too short and the pad itself isn\'t as wide as I\'d like, but I give it 5 stars because it\'s still the best pad on the market."

What a difference!  The pad is thin, yet very absorbent.  The wings are perfect, and the material is the softest that I have ever come in contact with. I have many skin allergies, but this product doesn\'t cause a reaction.  I\'m hooked!"

Wish I hadn\'t ... the adhesive doesn\'t stick to anything but itself, so the pad bunches, AND it doesn\'t absorb worth anything.  I ruined the clothes I was wearing for the first time in many years because these things don\'t absorb as quickly or as much as Always Ultra-Thin pads.  Plus, they\'re more expensive than the Ultra-Thins.  Bottom line: don\'t bother."

I just wanted to do a review on this project.1. It\'s a lot cheaper to buy them in person (obviously)2. It doesn\'t look like what I thought it would... it just looks like a regular pad but with holes in them.I\'m hoping that it will at least work as good as the company says it will.
138,138,138,20100514,B0029NYQ2E,5,"May 14, 2010",A2FAQKTKUNXSEQ,"OMG! So SOFT, GREAT PROTECTION, Doesnt irritate like others!","First of all, I love these because it doesnt irritate you like all other pads out there. I love Always, and have always used this brand, but now I will never use anyother class from Always except the Infinity. These Always infinity does its job! I use to use the bulky kind the first few days, as I am extremely heavy, then the regular thin ones the last couple days, but they would irritate me so bad! I would literally have a \'diaper rash\' down there. But one day I sent my husband to the store to buy me some, and he brought me the Infinity. I was at first disappointed because they were so thin! I did not expect them to work so darn well! My husband was so scared that it wouldnt work and that I would be upset with him for buying the wrong ones, but I am now soooo glad he did. I will never use anyother ones besides these Infinity.Mainly because they are so soft. It feels like those packing styrophome thin sheets that they wrap around the TV screen when you first open the box. That type of smooth and cushiny type feel, just thicker than this sheet. And when I finally ran out, I had to borrow my moms other thins pads (not the infinity) and I only used it for two days and it irritated me again. So if you have that problem, get these. The really really absorb and are exremely soft! Its like magic. I dont see how its possible that it can absorb so much but it does!"
139,139,139,20091023,B0029NYQ2E,5,"October 23, 2009",A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,Always does it again!,"When it comes to feminine products, only the best will do. I was a user of Always Ultrathin with Wings before. These came as a sample in one of those packages. What an excellent marketing ploy. I did not think they could improve Always Ultrathins but they have.COMFORTAlways Infinity are oh so soft, thin and dry. Compared to Ultrathins, Inifinity feels more like tissue paper. They keep me drier than Ultrathins by somehow drawing the moisture away from me. With Ultrathins I feel dry. With these, I feel drier. I feel like I don\'t have any pads on.PROTECTIONI will not buy pads without wings. Always Infinity has double wings. Not sure if the double wings are actually better than single wings, but wings are wings and they do protect the sides of the panties just like the Ultrathin with Wings do.The back of the overnight Infinity is longer and wider than the front of the pad for that leakage that seeps backwards. So far, I have not had any accidents. The Infinity regular size, of course, doesn\'t have this added length in the back. I find the regular size adequate for daytime protection.Always Infinity are the most absorbant pads I\'ve ever used. Don\'t know what technology they have, but he moisture is pulled away from me and locked inside. When I change them, I feel they could still absorb so much more. With Ultrathins, I usually think they are at the end of their life.PROS:+wings+thin+keeps moisture away+most absorbant+soft and comfortable+overnights are longer and wider in backCONS:-NONE! Don\'t know how they\'ll improve these!SUMMARYAt the risk of sounding like I work for the company (I don\'t have any ties, trust me), try these. You\'ll be a convert.UPDATE:  Yes, I\'ve been using these ever since I\'ve been introduced to them.  The different lengths correspond exactly to what I need -- regular, heavy and overnight.  There\'s even a little note on each one telling me which side goes forward.  Still haven\'t found any cons."

They are soft, absorbent, and are superb at keeping me clean and fresh. They cost a bit more than other alternatives, although I think it\'s well worth the confidence I have, knowing that I\'ll never have a problem when I use these.One gotcha:  Keep quiet if you bring a box of these to work and keep them in your desk. Less-prepared co-workers will beg, borrow and (usually) steal them once they discover how well they work.  This brings up the cost per use (for you) up by a whole lot.  I suggest hiding the contents of the box in an old Pampers wrapper.  This will keep all your co-workers far away from your \'stuff.\'"

This time around I decided on trying Infinity based on the description and a sale at the grocery store.  I was amazed.  They are thin, the top stays pretty much dry/a bit damp, and they absorb a lot.  Of course, each woman\'s body is different so this may not be the same for you.I travel and live a lot in countries where I may not be able to make it to a washroom to change my pad for quite some time, and these have held up immensely.  Even plane, train, automobile travel - no issues.  I started passing out a couple at a time to friends to try because I find them so revolutionary."

It\'s very comfortable and I\'ve never had any problem with leaks. This pad does such a good job of wicking away the flow that you are in danger of not knowing when it is time to change. How can something this thin be so absorbent?  The science behind this pads performance won them a prestigious Edison Award. I will never use anything else."

It\'s the only pad that really works!!! It\'s amazing. Some reviewer complained that it\'s like a diaper, I guess she does not have heavy period like me.

After quite a long time of dealing with that \'uh-oh\' feeling (you know what I\'m talking about) several times during the day and night and racing for the restroom to try to avoid a mess, I found these. Yes, they are just a bit bulky and uncomfortable, and yes, they feel a little like a diaper.  But the peace of mind they offer is SO absolutely worth it.

They worked very well, but the wings could be a bugger to get set right sometimes especially if the folded or something while you put them on.As an alternative, I do recommend cloth pads (there are some really great ones available out there.) They wash up really easy in my experience and you don\'t have to worry about chemicals. I also end up having less leaks, less itchiness etc when using cloth pads.Another alternative that I highly recommend is a menstrual cup. I have a seriously heavy flow and menstrual cups work wonderfully. (I\'m talking about the silicone kind that you wash and reuse)They hold about twice as much flow as a tampon and I wear cloth pads or liners for back up. I can wear a menstrual cup comfortably but I\'m unable to wear tampons. Most tampons are also full of icky chemicals.Natracare is a good brand of disposable menstrual protection that doesn\'t have all the icky chemicals if you just can\'t bring yourself to try the other things or if you need something disposable sometimes."

No it\'s not thin.  It isn\'t supposed to be.The pad is a GREAT 15\' LONG.  Offering more protection where the flow goes which is toward our buttocks than any other on the market.  I for one am tired of connecting two pads to get any semblance of protection.  Even light flow doesn\'t go straight down, not if you have thighs which meet.  Some of you are complaining that its too big, well there are plenty more petite pads on the market if you indeed need a smaller pad but for those with a heavy flow and for women above a size 14 who have a big booty we need to APPLAUD THIS PAD for finally arriving for us.  I don\'t know why the industry didn\'t realize a century ago that you shouldn\'t be trying to make pads the same dimension when women range from 4\'9\' to 6\'7\'.  A 6-7\' long pad doesn\'t even protect the most direct fluid route if you\'re a larger lady. Lying down, flow goes awry even more so and for a pad to actually deserve the title OVERNIGHT it needs to come with a nice old old fashioned belting system (just a little strip folks) and truly be more like 22\' inches long.  We need a pad to reach from tummy to back of your waist if it is to prevent all staining and allow us to go to sleep without worry.  These pads don\'t do that and I wish they did.I still say manufacturers have no idea what a heavy flow is but I\'m afraid these are as good as its gets when it come to holding a lot blood. Good for postpartum.  If you have adenomyosis, fibroids, endometriosis, are in peri-menopause or GOD FORBID ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS, I\'m afraid even this pad will need frequent changing.  Do Diapers work as an alternative?  The answer is \'not so well\' as they are made of textiles meant to absorb a dilute fluid not a thick fluid.  Until Proctor and Gamble gets it right the natural green brand of diapers- TUSHIES in its largest size helps some with overnight woes.  If you are a tiny woman you might even be able to actually get one on completely, unwieldy to use (nothing to hold them on).  Alas they are kind to sensitive skin.Back to these pads...For comfort no one ever beats ALWAYS.  They have made the best \'tops\', the surface that touches your skin, for over 2 decades.  In other words they feel great and do stay dry.  These don\'t have the texture of their new Infinity line but instead have that sort of plastic lace top Always came out with back in the late 70s early 80s. I wish that they applied the Infinity odor control and material to THIS SIZE.  Layer the INFINITY textile over this pad.  That combination of materials I think would be a SMASH HIT!  Listen to MEEEE P&G.A word about those darned wings.  All they do is channel moisture toward your groin and hold it there against your skin to make you chafe.  They never stay in place.  They don\'t spare your pretty panties anything.  Take them away!  I tuck them under [or scissor them off].This pad has an adhesive strip protector sheet on top, and another on its back. I welcome that.  When was the last time you saw a women wash her hands BEFORE entering a stall?  You\'re handling a pad with your paws covered with every bacteria from elevator buttons, escalator rails, filthy knobs, currency, tickets, and other person\'s hands and then putting all those bad particles there.  That TOP protective sheet lets you get the pad on without transferring all that mayhem to your groin. That area needs to be handled as sterile-y (is that a word?) as you handle your eyes but no one seems to ever say that.  I wish pads were marked STERILE and were indeed that pristine.INCONTINENCE, these are useless for that purpose.  Add Always Max Protection Dri Liners.  They are as thin as a sheet of paper.  And as teeny as they are (really short) they do hold liquid and boost the performance of any pad they are added to.  Their adhesive is strong, stronger even than on these full size pads. They do not come with any kind of wrapper.I\'m switching back to Always from Natracare.  Went there to avoid chemicals and because there was a sort of quiet underground buzz abut Always is just not being sterile enough in their manufacturing and indeed causing infections but with heavy use Natracare\'s SUPER is irritating and their Nighttime Extra Long is woefully not up to par but if you want less of a pad than these they just might be right for you.  I\'m hoping P&G is making these in at least a CLEAN environment despite the fact that you never see the term STERILE in a sanitary product description.  I think it ought to be there especially for tampons.I DO RECOMMEND THESE FOR HEAVIER FLOW DAYS but unless your body is neater than mine you\'ll still stain sheets until manufacturers really bring the pad to waist.  That\'s just the simple unattractive truth of the matter.Finally the pads are WHITE, my flash may be making them look pink or purple.SOAP dot com with their great 15-20% off coupons and Amazon are running neck and neck on price.For Natracare the best price I\'ve found is at Lucky Vitamin  The Nighttime Extra Long was $3.45 for 10."

I\'ve always had a problem with being, shall we say... extra juicy. :) So, pantyliners are a staple item at my house. When it came down to choosing between Always & Carefree, a quick whiff of the package determined the clear winner. Carefree possessed an awful, overpowering floral scent that made me want to gag. It was the same stench that I had detected in many public restrooms, combined with *other* odors I dare not mention. OTOH, Always had a fresh, light, clean scent that was not the least bit cloying. Always is like a gentle breeze, whereas Carefree is comparable to a full-blown F5 tornado... with the lifeless carcasses of a few livestock caught up in the funnel. Always is simply the best choice for any woman/girl who seeks good absorption combined with a *slight* fragrance. The problem with highly-scented pantyliners is that, when combined with bodily fluids, they emit some extremely revolting fumes (exactly what I smelt in the public restrooms). Besides, who wants a pantyliner that will undermine your perfume? Who wants to hear \'Hey, what\'s that smell coming from your crotch\'? This will never be a problem with Always. But, scent factor aside, I also love these because they are thin, stay in place reasonably well (with the exception of profuse sweating), absorb a moderate amount of moisture... and I really dig the light blue wrappers (I hate pink; another reason why I\'m put-off by Carefree). :PConclusion: These pantyliners rule.

But I dreamed of something softer, something that wasn\'t rubbing against me and causing me irritation.  Finally, Always Infinity came along, and I\'ve been thrilled!Infinity Heavy Flow is perfect for  when I\'m having a heavy flow or need prolonged protection at night, when I need my pad to provide me with plenty of absorption.  The wings keep the pad secure, they actually wrap around and stick to my panty and the softness keeps me comfortable.  I like not thinking about my pad.  I also like that the pad is designed to be wider in the back.  I\'ve had experiences where my flow completely missed the pad, due to it being too short.  Length is very important if you\'re sitting or laying down for long periods of time.  Also, this is a good pad if you\'re a plus-sized lady.  What length size you choose also depends on your weight too, not just your flow.Out of the various pads that I\'ve purchased, I find that the Infinity series is a bit more expensive, but it is worth the extra change for the comfort and security.  Always Infinity Regular was my go to pad, but now, since trying out the Infinity Heavy Flow, I think I\'ll start using these for nighttime. A big plus, is that this brand comes in unscented, yea!  I don\'t have to worry about irritation due to deodorants that don\'t mask anything.  If you haven\'t tried this brand, do so, you will notice the comfort, immediately."

These wells increase the total surface area that liquid is in contact with the absorbent material and so the liquid not only passes through the surface layer faster, but it also gets absorbed faster by the inner material.Overall, this product does exactly what it claims to do.  Highly recommended for those prone to sudden heavy flow and those with minor incontinence. Pricey but worth it."

Although I\'m a loyal Always user, I had never tried their Infinity line of pads - honestly, I didn\'t know if they were that much better than their regular line to spend the extra bucks.Right away, I was shocked when opening the wrapper to see that the pad appears full of holes (over-my-head engineering towards absorbency, I suppose -- or perhaps aerodynamics? Ha!). Anyway, there IS a liner underneath, but it still looks a bit frightening. I bravely wore one, and yes, the absorbency and dryness was slightly better than the current Always products I use. The holes did their job.However, my favorite part of the Infinity pad is the wing design! I never would have thought much about it (wings are wings, I thought), but the Infinity pad has a scalloped \'B\' edge to its wing. I had more successful \'sticking\' of the Infinity\'s wing than I\'ve ever had with a normal curved \'D\' edged wing. Usually the wings (though very important and necessary to me in a pad), cause the most stress and hassle when applying! Part of it sticks, part of it doesn\'t and curls upward, leaving sticky spots exposed. Not comfortable. So, the \'B\' shaped edge of the Infinity pad was a plus!Overall, I would definitely use the Infinity pads again, but probably only if I had a coupon to defray the extra cost. Either way, I trust Always\' products for confident protection!"

I found this to be a huge plus, especially when worn overnight.  No chafing or irritation, even when worn while working out for about an hour.- Reliability: No leaks or staining even with heavy flow.  The channels on the pad help to lock in flow plus I found the pad stays in place very well, especially for a pad without wings.- Thickness: Here\'s where these pads lose some points.  A fellow reviewer compared these to a baby\'s diaper - I agree these are quite thick but willing to accept that for the positive factors above.  For overnight use the thickness of this pad isn\'t too big of a deal, but I wouldn\'t recommend wearing this pad under very tight fitting clothing (then again, maybe tight fitting clothes aren\'t such a good idea for the days you need a super maxi!)"

I love it.I was in the Vitamin Store, and saw this George\'s aloe.  I always buy the Lily of the Desert stuff, but this caught my eye, and I bought it. The price was similar in comparison.  I thought, what the heck, I\'ll give it a try.I\'m about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, and I now realize that I notice NONE of the beneficial Yin tonifying effects that traditional Aloe Vera Juice gives you.  Pretty much none whatsoever.  This Aloe tastes like distilled water.  Has no taste whatsoever.  A good part of Aloe\'s medicine is in the bitter.  All medicines in nature have a bitter tasting element to them.  Bitter is healing.  When you remove the bitter, I\'m not so sure it\'s healing anymore.I was reading through the testiominals on here, and they all seem stomach related.  Perhaps it has a beneficial effect on stomach woes, but since I don\'t have any, it did nothing for me.

I had to spend 10 minutes shaking the razor in both standing and running water to clean it out.  Now when you\'re up in the morning trying to get ready for work, you don\'t have that kind of time to spare cleaning a razor.Problem is, if you don\'t clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.Also, even after cleaning, it doesn\'t last very long at all.  On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &quot;indicator strip&quot; sooner.I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem.

446,26,26,20120301,B000052YHS,5,"March 1, 2012",A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,I keep coming back to the Mach3,"I\'ve tried many razors over the years including various electrics, and when I don\'t have a beard I always come back to the Mach3. The Mach3 was introduced by Gillette in 1998, and while I don\'t remember exactly when I bought a Mach3 set (or \'system,\' i.e., a handle and two blades), it was probably in 1998 or 1999. Since then I\'ve gone through a number of blades but have never replaced the handle, because I haven\'t had to.I have a pretty tough beard and have to shave daily if I want (or feel obliged) to look clean shaven.According to the current Wikipedia entry for the Mach3, the blades cost 9 cents to produce. I\'ve read conflicting stories about the history of disposable razor blades and I\'m not sure what to believe. But it seems to me that disposable razor blades and cartridge type blades in particular, like printer inks, are high profit margin items that deserve to be characterized as ripoffs. I recently tried using old fashioned double edge razors, the kind I stated with when I started shaving in the last sixties - I not only have my own old double-edge blade holder but have two even older ones that I inherited from my late dad - but as has always been my experience, I could not get through a shave without an annoying cut or two (and then I end up going out with little pieces of bloody tissue stuck to my face). If I thought I could get a clean, bloodless shave with a straight razor I\'d go that route. Electric razors can be okay in a pinch but it takes too much time and effort for me to get a really clean shave with an electric, and even then it\'s never as clean as the shave I can get with a Mach3. (I discovered Aveeno shave gel a few years ago and though I don\'t have sensitive skin, I\'ve found that it works better for me than any other gel or cream I\'ve used.)Obviously, not all guys have as good an experience with the Mach3 as I\'ve had, and that makes sense, because every guy\'s beard and skin is different.When I have more than a couple of day\'s growth, I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work.

451,31,32,20110818,B000052YHS,5,"August 18, 2011",A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,"Fast, effective, stupid-proof","The reason to buy this razor is so you won\'t have to think about shaving. There\'s no special technique, it\'s easy to clean, and it\'s disinclined to cut you. It doesn\'t feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I\'m using the same handle, and I\'ve since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can\'t feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don\'t reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won\'t fare as well. I\'ve bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.I\'ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it\'s difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it\'s been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge. Nitpicking, really.A safety razor would probably give you a closer cut, but if shaving is something you dispense with rather than an event to relish, the Mach 3 is where it\'s at.    "

These blades would not stay on either of my Venus razors - the friction from drawing it up my leg was enough to pop it off several times over the course of one shave.  They also did not fit correctly into the plastic they come in; I had to pull the blade out with my fingers instead of pulling it out by the handle like you\'re supposed to be able to do.

Poor design, breaks too easy.","So I bought one of these for my girlfriend and admittedly the first one she dropped and it broke very easily.  Still had plenty of blades though so I purchased another, and after a few weeks it broke without any sort of damage done to it. We still have a bunch of blades for it though, so do I buy another one so she can finish using the blades, or do we buy a different razor that won\'t just break after a few weeks.  So I do not recommend this purchase unless you feel like being trapped in a similar situation where you have blades but no handle for them to go on.  Extremely poor design.

This is obviously designed to drive consumers toward the newer shaving systems.  Being an older guy, I\'ve seen this happen time and again.  Suddenly, the blades you have been using for years are duller and don\'t hold their edge as well.  You move up to the newer shaving system to get back to the old comfort level, at a higher price.  Then, the cycle eventually repeats itself.

It has totally ruined my face.This is my 3rd bad experience with Gillette in 6 months. Previously I obtained a Fusion and I found razors only work for around 12 shaves (while I used to use Mach 3s for a few months years ago).Also I obtained a shaving foam and the bottom of the canister was totally stained after a few weeks ruining the place I have put it (in front of basin).

Are you interested in the sideburn trimmer? If so, than maybe Fusion is for you. If not 5 blades are not better than 3.

I will tell you why:1) The fusion has such a big head that there are some places that it simply can not go, I know that it has the blade on the back for those hard to reach places but that is only one blade - the Mach 3\'s head is much smaller and can get the whole head in those hard places.2)  Cost - why pay more gilette seems to think we want to pay more.3) Wilkerson Corp said it best when the company said \'the simple addition of one blade does not necessarily make for a better shave.\'  Only if things in life were that simple.Had Gilette not sent me the free Mach 3 I would have probably never known about it and stayed with the more expensive model.

Shaving\'s about as pleasurable as a molten lava enema.  Fortunately, the right products can make it a little more bearable.  I\'ve never anticipated the release of a shaving product of any kind before, but this razor got me really intrigued.  Could this be the razor that conquers my impossible face (and wallet) once and for all?Gillette have been the masters of shaving comfort for several years now.  Their introduction of the Mach 3 razor was a breakthrough, just like they said.  A lot of you likely still use the Mach 3, but it\'s a good bet the Fusion will make you want to upgrade.I\'ll admit, I was a little wary about using a five-bladed razor.  I felt the same way about the Mach 3; I envisioned pressing too hard and slicing into my jugular, or worse, going to work with an entire roll of toilet paper on my face.  Thankfully, the opposite happened, and I used the Mach 3 and M3 Turbo for years.  I even bought into the M3 Power when it came out, but found there wasn\'t much difference in closeness or comfort (which is why I chose the manual Fusion over the Fusion Power).  Still a really good shave, though.Anyway, about the Fusion.  First off, don\'t be intimidated by the five blades.  They\'re close enough together that you really have to try to cut yourself.  In fact, that\'s one of the beauties of this razor.  Even a face like mine, which is very susceptible to cuts, accepted the Fusion\'s blades with very little irritation.  The first couple of times I used it, I had to watch out for pressing too hard and suffered a couple minor nicks, but I quickly got the hang of it.  The blades really do all the work.  The head of the razor is bigger than the M3 as well, which actually does cut down on shaving time.I\'ve always liked the \'indicator\' strip on the top of the M3 blade that lets me know when it\'s time to change the blade, and it\'s here on the Fusion as well.  It\'s made with aloe, if you\'re interested in that sort of thing, which supposedly aids in shaving comfort.  You\'ll get about a week\'s worth of good shaves before the blade wears out, which works out to a pack of cartridges a month (about the same as the M3).  It\'s best to pick these up in bulk (packs of 8); if and when you switch to this razor, you\'ll need them anyway, and you\'ll save a little dough in the process.The extra blade on the back of the razor is rather neat indeed.  It does help even out your sideburns and touches up those tricky spots right under your nose and above your chin.  I wouldn\'t use it for beard sculpting or anything, but for tough areas it does a good job.  Just be mindful of that blade when you\'re shaving near your ears.  I accidentally nicked my earlobe shaving my jawline the first time I used it. Yeowch!Changing the blade out is just as easy as the M3 also.  Just pop, slide, and click a new blade in.The \'comfort guard\' under the main blades is a slight improvement from the M3, but it\'s not really a \'wow\' factor.  The \'ergonomic\' handle is pure gimmick; it does little more than make the Fusion look like a phaser from Star Trek.  I would rather just buy the blades and have them fit on my Mach 3, but what kind of marketing savvy would that be?  Oh well; the razor itself isn\'t exactly a bank-breaker, and you only have to buy it once.All told, this is the Porsche 911 of razors.  It\'s a smooth ride, it\'s comfortable, it\'s fast, and yes, even though the blades are pricey, it\'s worth it to me.  If I had my druthers, of course, I\'d use an electric (they\'re much less expensive in the long run), but they\'re just not compatible with my face and Rocky Mountain-ish peaks and valleys of my neck.  (Believe me; I\'ve tried five different kinds.)  The Fusion\'s the closest shave I\'ve gotten with a blade yet.  If you really saw the difference between the M3 and M3 Power on your face, you\'ll probably notice it with the Fusion Power as well, but I figure I\'m paying enough for the one without the motor.I\'m glad I made the switch, and after comparing with the Mach 3, I won\'t go back.  Try it and see for yourself.    "

The shave is close, smooth and free from razor burn. The lack of razor burn is remarkable with a new blade.But the extra single-blade is another matter altogether.  Because the main 5-blade setup is so big, some provision had to be made for tight spots like under the nose.  It\'s an old-fashioned single blade. I really don\'t remember when I last used a single blade.  I think that\'s why I dislike shaving. Oww, yes, it\'s that old-time razor burn in spades.So after any shave you can contrast the burn beneath your nose with the smooth, closely-shaved, unharmed skin on the rest of your face.After their big-buck R & D efforts, Gillette needs a way to solve this.(Or use a Mach III under your nose and the new Fusion  on the rest of your beard.)BTW, somehow they seem to have solved the clogged-blade problem that haunted the 4-bladed Shick Quattro.

First off, great design from the shape of the handle etc to the holder itself. If you like cool industrial design for the masses (think Michael Graves and so on at Target) then this will make you happy. It\'s also an impressive piece of manufacturing, that they can get the five blades lined up with such accuracy. Extra points for the design geeks.More importantly of course, the shaving experience itself. I live in Minnesota which right now (winter) has quite a dry climate, so a harsh shave will leave you with raw, uncomfortable skin for most of the day. I\'m not sure if this razor gave a closer shave than with my Mach 3, but it certainly was way quicker and required fewer re-strokes, which cuts down on irritation and the potential for nicks and cuts. It was easy to shave the hard-to-manage parts of my face where the hairs aren\'t all lying in the same direction, like under my jaw, which again cut down on the number of re-strokes. Once I got used to the extra razor on the back of the cartridge, I liked the way I could use it as advertised: for near my nose, round my goatee etc.I have to admit that I thought five blades sounded ridiculous, but it does seem to work just as stated in the manufacturer\'s blurb.UPDATE: Now had this for about two weeks, and I\'m continuing to be happy with it. I\'ve noticed a lot fewer problems with ingrown hairs and little nicks and cuts. The cartridges seem to last a good long time too - I haven\'t had to change the first one yet and it still does a good job.    "

913,493,503,20110703,B000BUUVTE,4,"July 3, 2011",A1IIUCG9TJFUWS,Wish I\'d Bought One Sooner:,"When I first heard that somebody was actually selling a 5-blade VIBRATING razor, I thought I\'d never EVER try it. It sounded like a perfectly good way to turn my face into a pepperoni pizza with extra EVERYTHING on it. The truth, however, is that this is a FANTASTIC product, and I now wish that I\'d bought one MUCH sooner.Random thoughts (since so much has already been said in the Amazon reviews here):1. I HATE shaving. I just frigging HATE it. I can never quite seem to get it just right, and I generally do end-up looking like something straight out of a Stephen King novel when I\'m done. THIS razor has actually changed that for me; I have yet to cut myself with this thing -- believe me when I tell you that (for me) that is really saying something -- and I honestly think that you\'d have to TRY to draw blood with this thing in order to do so.2. Thirty (plus) Dollars for a dozen replacement blades is absurd. (I do pay it, though. Because the shave IS that good.)3. The originally installed blade (usually) in products like these is a high-quality (pharmaceutical grade) titanium (this is true for almost everything sold in this retail space, by the way), and is designed to give you a fantastic first impression -- which it does. The originally installed (set of) blade(s) is an incredibly sharp, long-lasting set -- a finely-tuned, well-engineered piece of highly-toleranced machining that is designed to keep you coming back for more -- which means: buying replacement blades, and a LOT of them. That first, originally-installed set of blades is created to IMPRESS, and the real test of a concept (such as vibrating blades) really needs to be taken past the first usage, and deep into the experience of using replacement blades. I\'ve been using this for about a year, now... and the product continues to impress.4. Replacement blades, of course, are quite different than the originally installed blade -- but there is a simple method to make your replacement blades last much longer than they do, and it\'s this: spray some shower cleaner on the blades, and hang the razor upside down, so any moisture can drain away. The alcohol within the shower cleaner will pull the water away from the blades, and will keep it away. This will prevent the conditions that create rust on the actual blade(s) -- and without that chance to rust, your blades will last for weeks EACH.5. Shaving with a vibrating razor takes a bit of getting used to: you don\'t \'pull,\' but instead, you sort of let it \'drift.\' That\'s not exactly correct, but it\'s close enough. All you really need to do is to exert enough pressure to indicate the general direction of the stroke, and let the razor DRIFT at its own speed. You don\'t \'pull,\' and you don\'t force it. You let it drift.6. Use a good shaving gel, set-up a fogless mirror in the shower, and this thing will give you some incredibly close shaves as you stand under hot water. Take care of your blades with a bit of alcohol-based shower cleaner, hang the unit upside down so water can drain away, and this actually is a worthy investment -- even if they do charge $30 for a set of replacement blades.4 stars.Thirty Dollars for 12 replacement blades is NUTS.That\'s not even debatable.

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.    "

Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn\'t waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3\'s were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I\'ve had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an \'upgrade\' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you\'re handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, \'What were they thinking?!\' crosses my mind.  I\'ve discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself.

The Fusion design is truly excellent and far superior to other razors. The handle has been greatly extended compared to the Mach 3 handle, and a noticeable amount of weight and girth has been added as well. This is a razor that will feel comfortable in almost any man\'s hand. The blade cartridge itself keeps this razor from getting 5 stars in my opinion.

This will require many men to slightly alter the way they shave their faces; however, the one-blade trimmer (on top of the razor) helps a good bit.The shave: a disappointing 3 stars. The Fusion gave me an incredibly close shave. I mean incredibly close. My face hasn\'t been that smooth since I was a child. I thought the trimmer worked well for its purpose.

With most razors, I typically have to change blades once a week. With the Fusion, I used the same blade for 2 weeks with no trouble at all. The blade still felt fresh after a week, and drag was minimal into the second week.Overall: The razor was decent. Certainly an impressive shave, but perhaps too close for some due to the unneccesary number of blades. The biggest problem with the Fusion is that the blades are insanely expensive. In my opinion, the cost of Fusion blades diminishes everything else that might be good about it.UPDATE: Decided to give the Fusion another shot by buying an entirely new system with a new blade. Still an incredibly disappointing razor with lots of irritation. It\'s just one or two blades too many. I cannot say the shave is any closer than a Schick Quattro or even a Gillette Sensor Excel on a good day. Would be nice to see Gillette take this razor design, with the longer handle and closer blade spacing, and port it over to a 3-blade.    "

I always got razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and my facial hair isn\'t even curly. I have tried everything from electric razors, to clippers, to double edge safety razors, and even changing the directions that I shaved. Nothing has ever really worked.  I received a free fusion in the mail, and was skeptical. I tried it, but I still got razor bumps. But then I thought for a second about shaving WITH the grain and NOT stretching the skin, and thought even more about using a shaving brush that I had purchased. I also decided to use a simple, cheap shaving cream, Barbasol Aloe Shaving Cream that I already had in my closet. I found the SOLUTION!  But I should also mention that I shave in the shower with a mirror. I now look forward to shaving, and I feel that shaving everyday is best because it allows your face to grow accustomed to shaving, also allowing the hairs on your face to grow in the direction that you shave, remember-WITH the grain. If you shave with the grain you greatly reduce your chances of having ingrown hairs. If you want to love shaving, and be like that guy who has a perfect shave, get yourself a gilette fusion, a shaving brush, a shower mirror, and a mug. Shave in the shower:Let your face get wet with hot water for at least 2 mins, put some shaving cream on a brush and stretch your skin out (only while brushing)  and brush your beard for 2 mins, fill your mug with hot water and dip your razor in the mug every couple of strokes. Shave in the direction of hair growth, never against and don\'t stretch it, if anything puff up your face! I make two passes, after the first one I re-lather and fill my mug up again with more hot water. And you don\'t need to leave the water on!!! That\'s what the mug is for. Try this for a few days and tell me, someone who has suffered for 7 years, that it isn\'t the best shave you ever had.    "

I\'ve been using the manual Fusion razor for almost two weeks now and am so impressed that I\'ve stopped using the Schick Quattro Midnight altogether.

I finally switched to a manual razor.PG\'s Gilette sent me both the Fusion and the Mach 3 free, so I tried them both.  I think P&G\'s Gilette is trying to confuse me.  I like the Mach 3 better than the fusion becasue:1) smaller head makes it easier to get into those small places, true the fusion does have the one rear blade for this prupose but the head was so large that I was not able to get the blade into those hard places.  The Mach 3 was able to get the whole head into most of the small places which certainly beats getting just the one blade in there.2) While the Fusion\'s handle was well balanced so was the Mach 3\'s handle and the Mach 3 had better gripping surface then the Fusion did.3) Lower price on the Mach 3, IMHO, means that the Mach does not need to beat the Fusion just get close to it.  In my test the Mach 3 did better than the Fusion.In terms of the question that I posed in my title, as with everything else in life which is better for you depends on what type of beard you have.  Do you have a heavy beard and have to shave multiple times a day(like Tip O\'Niel) or are you a teen, then the Fusion is probably the best thing for you.  Do you have a moderate beard?  The the Mach 3 is probably more what you need.  Or if you have a light one that does not grow very fast, like mine, then the Sensor or the Sensor Excell is more of what you need.  I think that I am going to go for the Mach 3.I stuck with the electric razors for years thinking that the manual razors would nick and irritate my face.  The may have been true thirty years ago but not now.  Electric razors don\'t give you anywhere near as close a shave as a manual does.As for shaving gell goes, save your dollars and buy the Barbasoll brand.  Costs less and is much better than the Gillete Fusion gells.    "

Pros:Handle is weighted well.Very close shave.Less irritation than previous generations, even against grain.Extra blade on back=worth it.Cons:5 blades get gunked up quickly, requiring more passes.Long surface area (of blade) takes some getting used to.Expensive; not compatible with Mach3 system.Update:Down to 2-3 Stars.Used the razor for about two weeks and found that it did not function as well as the Mach3. If you are not an everyday shaver (sometimes I don\'t shave on the weekends or holiday breaks) you will suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth of growth. Also, I found that I simply wasn\'t getting as close a shave as I did with the Mach3, even when shaving every day. I agree that there was less irritation, but only slightly so. I do miss the sideburn blade and the heft of the handle, but I\'m happy that I returned it and purchased more blades from my Mach 3 Power instead--for me, at least, this wasn\'t an improvement.   "

Thus the beginner tag. I stopped using a bladed razor because of cuts. For years I kind of accepted an average shave from electric razors because I just knew a blade would cut my face. I even grew a goatee because I could not get a clean shave on my chin. About two weeks ago I received an unsolicited free Gillette Fusion in the mail. I just sat it on my desk and figured I would toss it out eventually. Something inside told me to \'research\' it on the Net. I did and decided to give it a whack come Monday morning (Nov. 6). After perusing these reviews I decided to not buy the Fusion gels. I instead bought the Face Scrub, Shaving Gel and Post Shave Lotion of the Neutrogena Men, Razor Defense line. Let\'s just say I did not know I needed a Face Scrub product. :-)With some trepedition I went ahead with my \'test.\' I could not believe how gently the Fusion glided across my face. And, just as importantly, what an improvement over my electric razor. I honestly do not think I could cut myself if I tried. Okay, of course I could. :-)I recommend this razor. I have not used Mach3, Sensor, etc. so I can\'t say it is better or worse. But I like it.P.S. The cartridges are, of course, overpriced.    "
973,553,573,20060521,B000BUUVTE,1,"May 21, 2006",A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,This is a terrible razor... a BIG step backwards.,"I began using Gillette\'s Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...)  The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves.  That was an excellent product.  However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model.  I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be.  I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none.  I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal?  Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product?  That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one?  If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off.  I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it.  So much for my customer loyalty.  I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.    "

They very cleverly use terms like \'a better way to shave\' or \'30% closer blades\', and there is a reason for this. The reality is that very little (if any) improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems. And Gillette knows this through their own internal research. Their studies show that customers can\'t discern the difference between 3-blade and Fusion systems. It is all just perception. However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems. The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.Here is another interesting tidbit you probably didn\'t know about all of this. Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements. Well there is a reason for this too. The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer. Gillette doesn\'t want folks to get a bad first impression. As you probably know, they don\'t make money on the razors. The real money is with the replacement blades. And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.With the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.

Tried it and got the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had. I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.That sample Fusion blade lasted about 3 months (I kid you not) and I do have a heavy beard. Wow, I thought. These blades are expensive, but if I didn\'t have to change them as often, it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills. The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.I purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out. What the heck? After about a week the replacement blade was dull. I went through the 4 pack in about a month and bought a second pack at another retailer. Same thing. One week=1 blade.Gillette must really think we\'re stupid. Give the suckers a free sample that\'s great and make them pay for crummy blades after they\'ve committed to the system. Never again, Gillette.....I just ordered a Braun cordless from Amazon so you can just go pick someones else\'s pocket.Edited: Any suckers our there still letting Gillette rip them off? Yeah, I guess so since they\'re still in business. The Braun electric I mention above has recently been relegated to backup status to my Merkur double edge razor. Yep, one of those things like my dad used and that I learned to shave with. Blades cost about 7 cents each in bulk and last about a week.

When I bought the M3Power, I assumed that I would never feel the urge to buy another razor because it had 3 blades (seemed like plenty) and had the power component, so what else was there?But then I started hearing about the Fusion and I read these Amazon reviews, and I decided to take the plunge and give it a shot (oh how I miss the days when they used to send the Mach3 free in the mail!). Costco has a nice deal where it is $18 for the Fusion Power with 4 blades (and handle) so I should be set for some time. I used each M3Power blade for at least a couple months without incident so the same should be true for the Fusion. I remember when the Mach3 first came out and it was recommended to change the blade every 3 months, but now because of that Aloe strip, they only last 3 uses? To me that is nonsense and wasteful as the blades themselves work just fine down the road and so do the microfins which IMHO work fine even if there is no more Aloe left!Anyway, I couldn\'t wait to have my first shave with the Fusion, and I couldn\'t believe how fast I was finished shaving my whole face! Because the blades are closer together, it felt as though I was shaving with barely even one blade, and I did not find that hairs got stuck between them which was my only concern with the design. With the power turned on, the razor went smoothly across my face, and I barely felt anything which is really what one wants when shaving. I personally don\'t like to go against the grain on my neck, but the Fusion did a decent job going with the grain so I was most pleased. The single blade on the back was nice for evening out sideburn hair and getting at those pesky under-nose hairs. Lastly I felt as though the pivot motion of the blade head was even more forgiving than the predecessors which made the transition between shaving my face and shaving my neck hair even smoother.The only gripes I have are its cost, but that\'s obviously a supply/demand issue, and its color which is orange and quite bright. I like the blue of the Manual Fusion better, but I like the power that I get from the Power Fusion, and since color is superficial, it is hardly a big point of concern. I just wonder if Gillette intended this color to displease people so they will be enticed when they come out with the Fusion \'Nitro\' or some other color scheme!Still this is the BEST razor on the market and worthy of a buy if you are like me and don\'t go through a razor head every week.

While I was impressed with the Mach 3, and more so with the Mach 3 Turbo, when I switched to the Quattro, I knew that was the razor for me. Close shave, smooth glide, rarely any cuts at all even on my difficult-to-shave face. Recently when I went to the store, they were out of the 4-pack of Quattro blades, and so instead of buying an 8-pack, I decided to try this brand new razor from Gillette. I\'d never had a 5-blade razor before (let alone a battery-powered vibrating one) and so I decided to go all out, even though I was very disappointed to find that the cartridges cost $3.50 EACH.It comes in a nice easy-to-open clamshell package with a cheesy-looking but convenient holder that can either lay flat or stand vertically, which is what I prefer. It comes with a battery, which was very easy to install, and is touted as being shower-proof. I wouldn\'t know, because I don\'t shave in the shower.The vibration was not at all what I was expecting. I don\'t really know what I was expecting since this was my first powered razor, but when they say \'gentle micro-pulses\' I think of a soft intermittent buzz. Not so. This razor is strong, and it vibrates like a cell phone, constantly, insistently and very noticably. I was surprised by how strong the vibration was for a small appliance.I used my standard Gillette foam shave cream, and set to work trimming my face. The first thing I noticed is that I couldn\'t really feel the razor on my face as it vibrated and shaved my whiskers. The second thing I noticed is that I also couldn\'t feel when my face was clean-shaven while the razor was vibrating. I rely on the way the razor feels and sounds on my skin to know when I\'m done shaving a spot, and the vibration drowned out any noise or sensation or any other feedback I might have gotten from the razor. However, it didn\'t make that much of a difference, because I had to go over the same spots four or five times in order to make them clean-shaven. I\'m not sure what the 5th blade is doing, but I don\'t have to shave the same spots that many times with even an old blade on my Quattro. However, when I was done, the final result was a pretty good shave, with a few nicks here and there--the Fusion doesn\'t work well with bumps on the face when vibrating.I also used the single trimmer blade on my sideburns. It seems to work as advertised, and it is easy to use for accurate trimming of the sideburns. The problem, however, is that the single-blade end is no good for shaving a larger area such as your entire moustache, but the five-blade side is way too large for such a task. I found it very awkward to shave my moustache area with either end.Bottom line: I will be returning the Fusion and exchanging it for a set of replacement cartridges for my Quattro. It still outperforms the Fusion in spite of having one less blade in the area of comfort and shaving sensation, and the cartridges are $1.50 cheaper each. I may go back to the Fusion sometime, but if I did, it would be the manual version, never the vibrating version. This was my first and last experience with a battery-powered razor.    "

I\'ve been a big fan of the M3Power since its release.  I didn\'t buy in to the hype of the Quattro, especially since it\'s a manual razor.  I thought, \'three blades is good enough, what good could four blades do???\'  I only picked up the Fusion because I\'ve never had a bad experience with a Gillette razor...even when I picked up this Fusion, I was a little skeptical about the difference five blades would have over three.  BOY, was I wrong.  It\'s been written in a few other reviews here, but it bears repeating:  This is easily the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had.  Moving with the grain, it doesn\'t even feel like a razor is touching your face.  Even going against the grain, there\'s smooth action and no nicks.the only problem i had was with the head being a little too big to effectively catch the area under your nose.  HOWEVER, there is a single blade on the back of the cartridge for this exact purpose.  I applaud Gillette for the research and customer feedback that went in to the design of this razor.I hate to sound like a commercial, but my wife felt my face after I shaved, and she said that it was the smoothest my face has ever been.  I\'m VERY satisfied with my purchase, and you will be too.  I love this razor (as much as a man is allowed to love a razor.)    "

I have pretty thick facial hair, though it is not especially fast-growing (no big problems with five o\'clock shadow and I only shave every two or three days - though on day three, I\'m pretty grizzled). The Fusion gave me the closest shave ever - especially on my neck around the Adam\'s apple, which is an always-difficult area. I usually find a few stray stubbles, even with my Mach3 Power that I\'ve been happily using for quite some time, but today my neck was smooth and clean with no \'re-do\'.The five blades of the Fusion are closer together and thus occupy about the same amount of space as the three blades of the Mach 3.  This results in a very smooth feel to the shave - you don\'t feel the five separate blades, just one shaving surface.  I did feel some tugging on the heaviest parts of my beard (I hadn\'t shaved since Sunday morning).I also found I didn\'t need to go back to \'re-shave\' certain areas.  My facial hair is pretty dense and there are certain spots on my upper cheeks, directly under my jaw and on my neck that I tend to miss or just don\'t get a close shave on the first go-round.  This wasn\'t a problem with the Fusion.The extra sixth blade works exactly as described and is a fantastic addition.  I was able to easily (and accurately) straighten out my sideburns and get those few stray and hard-to-get-at hairs under and next to my nose.Overall, I\'m very impressed.  I recognize that there is a certain amount of hype surrounding new introductions from Gillette - but it seems like they really do their homework.  When they first came out with Mach3 Power, it seemed like a gimmick - but I found it gave me a closer and more comfortable shave.  Now, with the Fusion, it feels like another leap forward in shaving technology...  I\'m sold and give the Fusion Power my unqualified recommendation.    "

I\'ve been shaving with it almost everyday starting January 27th. It is a totally new shaving experience! The razor glides over your face easier than any razor I\'ve ever used, and there is less...almost no...irritation. The time it takes me to shave has not been significantly reduced, but it has helped some and I do like the less irritation that it provides.I\'ve found the new razor lasts me 5 to 7 days of shaving before it wears out. However, the blue strip does wear out after about 4 days, but I continue to use it for a few more. I had used the Mach 3 Power razor for several years and the new Fusion Power is the best shave yet. I had similar results with the Mach 3 blades lasting about 5 to 7 shaves.I usually let me face have a rest on the weekend from all the shaving during the week, and I haven\'t stopped that tradition. For the past two weekends I skipped a day and shaved on Sunday or Monday morning.The razor has had no problems shaving through two days of growth. I have thick stubble by day two and the shave is as good as ever. The razor doesn\'t get clogged and can be cleaned out easily.I\'m getting use to the new precision trimmer on the back of the razor to shave under my nose and side-burns. I\'m more impressed with the results than I was on day one, but not as I am with my old Sensor razor, which is what I still find myself using for those hard-to-reach areas.I\'ve been using Gillette products for 17 years. I started with the Sensor and have bought and used every razor Gillette has made since! I have \'em all!The price is high, I\'ll admit it! But I think I\'m going to stick with the New Power Fusion for now. I still have some of the Mach 3 Power blades I need to use so once those are gone, I\'ll be strictly using the Fusion Power Razor.One other thing to consider is the kind of shaving cream or gel you use. I\'ve noticed that the better, \'more expensive\' ones provide a better feeling during and after a shave. I currently use Gillette\'s Shaving Gel, but I want to try the new Fusion Hydra Gel. I also want to try the King of Shaves gel. I\'ve also found the Neturogena razor defense post shave lotion to be a great product!Ultimately, the razor looks good and feels good in your hand.

Recently, I have been forced by them to move to Schick.  Not happy with being a virtual monopoly when it comes to men\'s shavers Gilette decides to over-engineer and to greedily get more profits by going so overboard that they have successfully made me give up on them after decades of being a loyal consumer.  As other reviewers have alluded to I actually got cut a couple of times which has never happened before!  I\'ve come to realise that the battery operated vibrator is a gimmick that does nothing at all to get a closer shave except to cause more batteries to be consumed and to fill up our landfills.  Thankfully, I\'ve been using rechargables for years and hence haven\'t had to buy batteries for years.  For people like me with sharper facial features, this 5-bladed \'wonder\' has such a large amount of rubber that it makes the overall blade area too high/thick (the breadth or height i.e. the vertical edge of the blade) to cover my chin area below my cheeks close enough without cutting my face.  Quite clearly the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns doesn\'t dawn on them when clearly there is a limit to the number of blades before you actually start spoiling the product!  For me it seems any \'improvement\' from going to 5 from 4 blades is so negligible to be non-existent in addition to giving me multiple cuts as the blades now do not contact my face as closely as before when I go from my cheek to my neck area.Unlike Schick where all their blades fit on all their holders greedy Gillette makes us \'upgrade\' to various blades by having to buy ever new blade holders.  Not content with profits from the blades alone, they have to insist on us buying the new holders to increase their revenues.Sick with the blatant exploitation of consumers, I have tried for the first time I can remember the Schick Quattro and I am happy now to get a close shave without cuts for a lower price knowing that any future blade enhancements will still fit my blade holder.Thanks Gillette for pushing me to your competitors; I didn\'t know what I was missing until now.Definitely NOT recommended!

Cynics of course would find it hard to eulogise over what was obviously just another fad and a rip off.  10 years later the Mach 3 is still VERY highly regarded and widely used even with the coming of the might Fusion Power with a whole two more blades and a built in vibrator to pleasure you even further.I thought I\'d experiment with the Quattro a few years back and I thought it was an improvement on the Mach 3.  I just liked the way it felt and shaved although it didn\'t shave any better than the Mach 3.  I did have one irritation though as it clogged up quite often and it was hard to get clean.  I even used scrubbing brushes to clear it, not always successfully.  I must have liked the razor though as I didn\'t toss it.My Dad was over on holiday and had forgotten his electric razor and was forced to buy a razor.  He happened to get the Fusion Power and he laughed about the five blades and vibrator.  He was soon mightily impressed with it though.  I haven\'t found out though whether he has continued to use it or not.A month ago after the blades for my Quattro were done, I decided to buy this Fusion Power.  I did read the review which were split on whether it shaved any better but everyone, almost, who used it liked it.I bought it and wasn\'t disppointed.  It is a lovely razor to use and the vibrator is novel.I then bought a brand new Mach 3 to compare this Fusion Power with.  I showered then lathered up and did half my face with each one then looked closely.  The shave was pretty much the same for both sides but bear in mind that the blade on the Fusion was a month old!  Mind you both sides felt very smooth although on closer inspection this wasn\'t the case.  It just proved to me that my technique may be a bit average and that you can\'t shave the hairs to the surface of the skin (unlike the simulations you see on TV).I have to say though that the Fusion is one hell of a razor.  It looks so cool and the tactile feel and shape is a big improvement over the Mach 3.  Shaving itself feels much the same though.  I don\'t have a challenging growth though, it is pretty average and I think the most important thing to get a good shave is to shower first.  After a shower you can almost get away with no shaving cream , that\'s how big a difference it makes.Overall in spite of the blades being twice the price almost, I love the fusion.  Gillette have made a product that is a perfect synthesis of engineering genius and marketing passion to produce a truly wonderful prodcut.I hate them of course as they have tempted me to buy a product that is objectively, no better than the Mach 3 but in the final analysis the sex appeal of this fine razor won me over.

1174,754,779,20080207,B000BUW8WM,1,"February 7, 2008",A29WWNOYAM96QB,A Real Dissappointment.,"Let me tell you first, I\'m a Gillette fan, I have been using Gillette razors for over 18 years, I was always excited when they released a new razor because every time it was better than the old one.So, possibly you wonder why I gave a 1-start poor rating to this product. I was excited to buy this new line of product, as being certain it would have been better than the previous line Mach 3 Turbo. Result a real disappointment. Here are the reasons from a Gillette fan you can trust:1. 5 razors don\'t work. Over the years for the sake of competition they made double blades, triple blades than it was not enough they released 5-bladed razors like this one. However, since they needed to put the blades closer to each other to fit 5 blades in a limited area of razor head, it simply didn\'t work. Let\'s continue,2. This product has very sharp blades but since 5-very sharp blades are located very close to each other it resulted very bad maneuverability. You simply cut yourself easily if you made a slight side movement while shaving.3. Blades are so sharp it doesn\'t allow you to focus on flat surfaces for a close shave. It just goes through and if you insisted on getting for a closer shave you will cut yourself.4. You might think I have a sensitive skin type, BUT believe me I don\'t. Believe it or not with a Mach 3 I never cut myself never, never. I have very thick and strong hair, I can\'t use a regular razor for shaving. Only and Only Gillette Mach 3 handles my facial hair but not this one.5. This product has engineering flaws which is resulted from competitive 5-blade which are put very closely together and you cannot handle this razor well even if you are a surgeon. I know because I\'m  very successful with using my hands because of my profession. But thanks to engineers who developed this I cut myself with this razor, for the first time.6. It\'s your choice whether or not you buy this product but I want to remind you that for the first time I\'m taking my time and writing a review for a razor, be careful it\'s a razor not a Gillette anymore.A final personal shaving tip: If you want your high quality razor blades last longer than usual, do not rinse them with hot or warm water while shaving. If you use cold water for rinsing blades, you will see them lasting sharp for a longer period of time.    "

That\'s how safe the safety razor has become.  I\'ve not nicked myself in over a year of use. The blade it came with lasted 3 months - but, as with previous models, the replacement blades are apparently made of less stern stuff.The wider spacing of the blades is vast improvement over previous models. Finally, you do not need torrential water pressure to clean your razor.  Actually, cleaning the Fushion reveals its best feature.  Under the flow of tap water, with the motor on, it sounds much like a mini didgeridoo, the Austrailian aboriginal instrument. I don\'t know if this was by design, but, if you\'re a world music fan, it\'s a delightful addition to your day. This is probably why they called it Fusion. Listen next time.    "

Do not buy!,"I happen to suffer from three things that my wife described until 5 years ago a hughe problem; 1) Extremely sensitive skin, 2) Very (and I men VERY) thick facial folicules, and 3) Keloid cicatrization.I solved my problems through trial and error (which means many cuts and sores!) and different blades and gel trials, I went from shick, wilkison blades, remignton, braun (Electrical) to gillette. And I came to always the same results, cut, burn, soring, irritation, razor burn, you name it I had it, and you can guess, many scars, which made the opperation of shaving worse every morning. The gel to keep it short I went from clinique to gillette and always the same result.  I was using one blade that made shaving more tolerable gillette\'s sensor excell when my wife arrived from one of her shopping errands and presented me with what came to be my salvation for the next four years, the mach3, which I put together with the Neutrogena sensitive skin gel and clinique\'s aftershave balm and the rest is history. Then I reluctantly accepted my wife\'s new present the Mach3 Power, and voila! My perfect match I haven\'t been this happy in years, comfy with minor irritation and no cuts for months! Until last week! When I felt so confident and adventurous about gillette\'s new product, I spotted it cueing in the supermarket and thougt \'It\'s gillette! More blades, better shave, what can go wrong?\' Well, when I arrived home my wife told me, that machine looks mean, and I replied, yes and I hope its mean with my beard and gentle with my skin, we shared a laugh. Next morning I went to the bathroom and started sahving, one pass, second pass, not bad... third pass... slash, hughe, and I mean big, cut just on the border of my mandible! I was pulling down when this happened! I was being extra careful due to the sharpness of new blades. It peeled off about 3/8\' by almost 2\' of my skin, I have only seen this kind of surgical precision on dermatomes! It took me eons to stop the bleeding. You can imagine my dismay, I got my refund and be done with it for good!Why can\'t Gillette just have a mach3 power with the nice features of battey indicator and the chip set as well as a more powerfull motor? That would work perfectly for anybody, hell... I would buy it, eventhough their product slashed my chin open!P.S. My wife told me \'I told you it looked mean\' I did not laugh.    "

My skin would hurt from the extra friction. Stick with the MACH III. It does a great job. The Gillette Fusion is not worth the price. I used it for about a month - Now I\'m back to the MACH III.

I use the Power Fusion version for my face since it gets rid of facial hair so much easier than using the manual one. All you have to do is put on adequate amount of gillette gel on your face (all types of gels for selection) including on your side-burn, turn on the power, and run it through your face just one time. I get the closest shave ever, and my hair grows fast. So I do this about 2 to 3 times a day.    "

I think the 5 blades is more of a gimmick, though I like the overall design, handle, and the fact that it vibrates. I am only giving it three stars because of the high replacement blade costs and the somewhat gimmicky design of 5 blades, but it\'s not a bad razor. I think the shaving performance is good but not great.    "
1210,790,816,20060923,B000BUW8WM,5,"September 23, 2006",A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,Best shaver I\'ve ever had.,"I\'m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.    "

I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond.I\'ve read all 60 reviews before mine, and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem. Maybe it\'s my shaving technique, but this thing is a weapon!    "

Saw this new fusion on tv and hopped on the boat to try it out. Was I disapointed. I have a thick beard and shaving down or up, I felt like my face was being cut up or like sand paper was going across my face.With the five blade it almost looks like the razer is getting cloged up more easily than the mach 3. The Precision trimmer was pretty useless. Although it did get the side burns pretty straight. Hard to shave around the nose area with the fusion. The head of the razer on the fusion is larger than the mach 3. Blade on the fusion not interchangable like the mach 3, mach turbo, m3 turbo, mach nitro. Marketing I guess to force you to buy a new handle. I felt the quality of the fusion felt more plastic while the M3 turbo I am currently using feels more heavier and well built. The vibration from the fusion although does feel better than the m3 turbo. I also agree with the other post the blades are ridiculously overpriced.All in all I give Gillete Fusion a 3 great idea though. Sticking with my m3 power.    "

Maybe that\'s where the advances end since I could not tell a difference in shaving between this razor and the Schick Quattro and M3Power razor.  I don\'t feel like it gets a closer shave.  In fact, I don\'t notice any advantages in this razor at all.If you have never used a \'Power\' razor before, try it.  The vibrating that is put off by the batteries is very slight but definitely makes for a closer shave. Battery life is long, and one advantage this razor has is a low battery life indicator. That\'s about it though. The trimmer that was hyped so much is pretty much useless.  I am not a very hairy guy, but I tried it on my sideburns and it didn\'t do anything. Maybe I wasn\'t using it correctly but I couldn\'t tell what it was supposed to do.  As for under the nose, it was worthless there too.The major disadvantage of this razor are the blades.  You\'re going to pay an average of $3 per blade! Considering a blade lasts two weeks at most (which is how often you should replace them, regardless of whether they still work), prepare yourself for a $60 a year razor budget.  The M3Power blades are only $2 a blade, and backwards compatible with previous razors.If money is no object and you don\'t already have an M3Power, this isn\'t a bad razor, but it\'s not nearly worth the hype and price when compared to its predecessor.

The blades tend to get expensive (and any Fusion blade will fit this unit---don\'t pay a premium for the package to say \'power\') but are well worth it if you have sensitive skin and desire a smooth quick shave.Some will debate the merits of having the \'power\' function.  Generally I only turn it on to get \'stubborn\' hair that tends to be anchored in - I find the vibrations help get them out - other than that I leave it off.Bottom Line __________  Get the cheapest fusion you can.  At the time I wrote this the regular Fusion was .35 cents more than the power.  If nothing else get this one and try the power out, if it isn\'t for you just remove the battery and you still saved yourself a few cents from the regular version.    "

Like all other variants, you can swap the razor blade and handles, which is convenient. The Embrace blade head has a large design. It\'s still more narrow than say, the Hydro Silk, to you\'ll ultimately need to make more passes because of the narrow path. However, the larger head didn\'t seem to impede shaving very much. I did notice that it tended to bend the wrong way when I was shaving from certain angles, which causes it to drag over my skin. I expected some irritation from it, but nothing happened. It feels a little weird when that happens, but there\'s no lasting effects.I get as good a shave from this as my Venus Divine, which I have always liked. This one has added an extra blade, but I\'m not sure if the shave is that much closer. This design is supposed to be more moisturizing, however. This is due to a large moisturizing strip that surrounds the blades themselves. I noticed that it felt, well, slimier upon first use. The moisture quickly dried up, however. Whenever I step into the shower to use this after leaving it sit, it gets a little moist once again, but it doesn\'t last. In my opinion, I wouldn\'t count on using this without shaving cream for any area other than under your arms.With that said, I\'m not ready to switch over from my Venus Divine. This works well enough but it doesn\'t work any better for me to justify the price increase.    "

We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs.

I still gave it four stars because it does what it should and it doesn\'t have any glaring faults.**** EDIT: After using this for some time I have come to the conclusion that it is far better than a razor with only two blades.  It cuts shaving time.  And over time, I\'ve found that I have to shave less.  Due to having to take fewer swipes with the blade, I\'ve also found that my skin isn\'t as irritated.

The ShowerPod also holds extra razor cartridges which I found to be another great feature.I have to say it really does give you a close shave.

1362,942,969,20080402,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 2, 2008",A3H7ADUP07D93H,Works great but no better than Venus Divine,"When I was growing up razors were a simple affair.  A single blade and that was that.  I remember the first ads when double blades started showing up.  The idea, according to the advertisers, was simple: the first blade would pull the hair so that the second blade could cut it closer to the skin, something that to me defied all logic.  I didn\'t have to worry about it for a long, however, as after a while I switched to depilatories.About a year ago I decided to switch back to shaving and went to buy a razor.  To my dismay, pretty much every model had four blades. What in blazes did anyone need all those blades for?  The heads of these razors were huge.  And why stop at 4?  Why not 6, or 8?  All I wanted was a simple double-bladed razor.  No luck.  I ended up getting the Gillette Venus with three blades and I\'ve been quite happy with it.  Seems someone at Gillette, however, thought that more would be better, or at least more profitable, so when I saw this new red five-headed beast offered through Amazon Vine, I thought I\'d give it a try and see if it was all just marketing hype.  I mean, what the hec? You can always use another razor around the house, right?.  To tell the truth though, I wasn\'t really expecting to like it.  I figured it would be bulky and awkward and just not worth the extra cost of the replacement cartridges.Turns out that this is quite a nice razor in spite of the extra size of the cartridge, which is definitely larger than the three-bladed ones.  First of all, I should point out that all Venus razors accept all Venus cartridges.  I was able to swap cartridges just fine between the new Embrace and my old Venus Divine.  It doesn\'t matter whether you bought a plain Venus, a Venus Divine or a Venus Embrace razor.  You can use any of the replacement cartridges with any of the razors.  The biggest difference between the cartridges is not the number of blades, but the amount of lubrication, as I discovered when I accidentally ordered plain Venus replacement cartridges instead of Venus Divine cartridges.To test out this new razor, I compared it to my old Venus razor with a new plain Venus cartridge, using the new razor on one side of my body and the old one on the other.  Much to my surprise, there was a huge difference in effectiveness as well as comfort between the two, with the Embrace cartridge coming up with much more hair.  Also, the lubrication seemed to smooth over the rough edges of any dull blades.  When you have this many blades, some of them are bound to be dull, but at a cost of about three bucks a pop, you don\'t want to have to throw one out.Okay, this is way too long a review for a stupid razor.  In short, both the Divine and the Embrace are great, better than plain Venus cartridges.  If you already have another Venus razor, though, there\'s no need to buy a new one.  Just get a pack of replacement cartridges.Oh, and by the way -- the blade holder thingy fell off my tile in less than 10 seconds and only holds two replacement cartridges anyway.  Gillette should scrap these things, which are just going to end up in landfills.    "

Well, I don\'t remember the name of the type I was using just prior to this - it has, I think, 4 blades and a waxy-looking purple strip of \'moisturizer\' above and below the blades section - but this new one, the Venus Embrace, doesn\'t do any better or worse a job than the previous types of blade.  I have always liked the Venus blades and I\'ll keep buying whichever type is available at the store, but if you\'re happy with your old Venus there\'s really no reason to change to this one.  Oh, it does come with a little suction cup thing to mount it on the wall of the shower or next to the tub - that\'s kind of nice.All in all, does a great job, just like I\'ve come to expect from Venus and Gillette.

Even holding the razor with wet and soapy hands is not a problem - the grip remains very secure, no effort at all.Using the Embrace is absolutely pleasant. For the first time since I began using such razors it didn\'t feel \'dangerous\' or as if my skin was being scraped - the new \'Ribbon of Moisture\' is a great and very noticeable step up from the previous \'moisture strips\' Gillette used. The 5 blades also feel totally safe. As a matter of fact they do what is advertised and feel like they actually adjust to the contours of the skin. I was truly impressed, because other razor models had made such claims before but I had never been able to actually feel that.Lastly, the results are equally great. I had used the Venus Vibrance before and find that the Embrace does a much better job. I can\'t stop touching my skin - it feels so incredibly smooth. The storage unit, the \'Shower Pod\', is nice and practical but nothing out of the ordinary and in itself not a reason to buy the Embrace.All in all, Gillette has definitely created a winner here, and I will stick with this model for a long time to come.

It did take a few attempts for the shower pod to stick on the shower wall, but once it did stick the razor fit neatly into the pod and it proved to be very handy. The blades face against the shower wall, so there\'s no fear of accidentally brushing against it and cutting yourself. The fact that there\'s room inside the pod for extra cartridges is terrific, in case you need to change the cartridges mid-shave. It is very easy to change the cartridges, which is a plus.

I have the Venus \'Vibrance\' and am quite happy with it, but decided to try the \'Embrace\' out of curiosity because I cut myself so often with just about any razor I use.  At the same time, it seemed like something with five blades would definitely cut closer and get most of the hair without having to go over multiple times and irritate my skin.  The question is, does it really hug to your curves and get all of your hair in one shave and leave skin smooth?  Yes, it does do a pretty decen job of doing these things, but I didn\'t feel it is a whole lot better than my three blad vibrance blades, except that it shaves just a little bit closer, which is nice.  So, overall, if you have sensitive skin, this might be a good razor for you.  If you like to just shave over an area once and expect to get all of the hair, this is about as close as you will get to that.  God Bless ~Amy    "

It can be intimidating to have that many razors touching your skin, but the moisturizing ring must do the trick to protect you.I LOVE IT and will be getting this early and often for my pretty woman.  :)    "

I highly recommend it.    "
1440,1020,1049,20080501,B000XVSNTQ,4,"May 1, 2008",A3JY5JLQ1ENMHX,Very comfortable,"I like Venus razors and have used the Venus Divine (blue and silver) for a few years now, so when I got the Venus Embrace, I actually decided to use both of them in the shower to compare.The razor handle of the Embrace has the same general shape as the Divine, but where the Divine only had one section with rubbery gel, the Embrace has the rubbery gel grip all around the handle. It makes for a much more comfortable feel. I personally would have liked the handle to be a little bit wider, like maybe half an inch, but I\'m still pretty pleased with the shape and feel. While the Divine didn\'t slip in my hand very often, the Embrace doesn\'t slip in my hand at all, so there\'s less of a chance of a painful nick.The Embrace has a slightly larger razor head because of the \'ribbon of moisture\' strips around the blades. The larger razor head is a little annoying because I have to be more careful about maneuvering the razor over my \'bumps.\'However, I am extremely pleased by those \'ribbon of moisture\' strips. They make for an incredibly comfortable shave, much more so than the Divine. I could tell the difference in feel right away and it was amazing. Just that factor alone made this razor worth the price.The Embrace has five blades while the Divine has only three blades, and I can\'t really say I notice a difference in shaving efficiency or closeness because of the extra two blades. I *might* be able to feel a slight advantage to the extra blades, but I\'m also not entirely sure if that\'s all in my head or if it\'s real.The ShowerPod that comes with the Embrace allows you to snap your razor into place and store extra blades inside the plastic pod. It attaches to your shower wall via suction cups, which in my opinion is a huge improvement over the old Venus ShowerPods that required you to attach them with double-sided foam tape. The ShowerPod is a nice place to store the razor in the shower, but I honestly think the whole concept of storing extra blades in the shower is unnecessary. I never change my blades in the shower--I do it before or after--so in my opinion, the storage space in the ShowerPod is a waste of plastic.All in all, this is a great razor if only for the fact it\'s so much more comfortable than the Divine. Don\'t get me wrong, the Divine wasn\'t uncomfortable at all, but the Embrace has improved the model significantly.    "

I know, I know, I could have purchased a razor holder separately, but I\'d never gotten around to it.  It\'s a nice little addition to this package.If I needed a new razor and handle, I\'d buy this one.  But I probably won\'t buy more Venus Embrace refills for it.

One criticism she had was that the holder didn\'t stick to the shower wall very well. And since we use that same tub/shower combo to bathe our 3-year old daughter, safety is an issue.

You don\'t need a set of safe cracking tools to open the plastic wrapping - there\'s a perforation for easy opening!  At last!Next you\'ll notice the storage pod that holds the razor and two spare cartridges.  The pod attaches to the wall with a couple of suction cups.  (Much nicer than the adhesive strips some manufacturers want you to use to attach their products to your walls!)  The pod is cute, but I don\'t stick things to the walls - so my pod and extra cartridges are going into a drawer.The main event is the razor itself.  The gel handle is very comfortable and the razor feels well balanced in the hand.  The head is wider than usual - a good feature when shaving the legs, may be kind of dicey on the underarms.  Another nice feature is the moisture strip which increases the glide factor on the skin, although it doesn\'t entirely eliminate the need for shaving gel or foam.The razor head shaves close and doesn\'t nick - at least the first time you use it.  The actual blades are on the thin / flimsy side, so you\'ll be changing the cartridge with above average frequency.  I don\'t know that a five blade head shaves any better / closer / faster than three blades, or two, or even one - but a five blade head does seem to clog up up more and faster than the others.  You\'ll be interrupting your shave quite a bit for rinsing and tapping.In summary, there are lots of cute features - the pod, the gel handle, the extra wide head and moisture strip.  The five blade head looks impressive, but the blades are flimsy and clog up five times as fast as a single blade.  Three and a half stars.    "
1474,1054,1083,20080415,B000XVSNTQ,3,"April 15, 2008",A2HXE29CU1I24Y,A few good improvements...until next year\'s replacement.,"Gillette has once again upped the ante by switching from a 3-blade shaving system and jumped to 5 blades since the competitor has brought to market their \'quattro\' version.I\'m surprised that after producing a powered razor in the form of Gillette Venus Vibrance, they have opted to go back to basics in a non-powered model that we now see as the Gillette Venus Embrace.  And despite being non-battery operated the price of both products has remained the same.PROS:1. The rubber grip on this new model is top of the line.  There is a \'gel\' quality feel to it that creates a soft cushion to the fingers, but still maintaining a nice solid grip.2. The shaving head is a size XL!  This means even more moisture content to help protect and smoothen the skin while shaving.3. The in-shower storage has been redesigned from the all=time rectangular shape of previoius Gillette razors and formed into a pod shape which Gillette now calls a \'ShowerPod\'.  The modern design is visually appealing and should enhance the bathrooms.Another good thing is that there are two suction cups behind the pods to create an easy install process.  This is a great move away from the old stick tape which can be placed once only with no chance for relocation should you decide you stuck it to a bad portion.  With the ShowerPods, you don\'t need to overthink your location which gives freedom to shift or hide the razor as you please.4. FIVE (5) Blades.  This is a matter of debate.  I welcome more blades to help reduce having to go over the same area and refrain from skin irritation.  More blades also means the hair has more chances of being cut even deeper has the blades pass over the area.  But I am quite disappointed as well with the quality of the blades (which brings me to the cons...)CONS:1. FIVE (5) THIN blades.  Compare the quality of the blades from the old Gilette Venus razors to this new 5-blade system and you will see what they have become.  It seems Gillette has every intention to help consumers keep on replacing the blades more often than before.  The blades are so thin that they loose sharpness faster than ever making you wonder and evaluate how much you should really be spending on this aspect of personal grooming.Of course I welcome more blades in a shaving system to create a smoother shave.  To achieve such characteristic is to have the blades spaced very closely together.  By choosing to do this, you risk loosing other customers that have a thicker hair folicle since a smaller gap means the hair doesn\'t pass thru between the blades and ends up getting stuck.  In the process, the shaving system fails to work as intended and resulting to nicks and cuts.The solution is to frequently run the blades and shake it in a container of water (or running water if you don\'t have the heart to save water at this day and age) in order to loosen and remove any shaved hair that may have piled up in the shaving head.2. EXPENSIVE.  Sure buying a new shaving system is relatively cheap.  But if you still haven\'t learned from the PRINTER/INK CARTRIDGE market, you should watch out for the price of replacement heads especially for newly introduced technology like this.3. MARKET LIFE.  As with Gillette products and marketing, they always have something up their sleeve.  So I wouldn\'t be surprised if they have a powered version ready for market release or a simple change of color depending on the theme of the times.  So you invest in a pack of replacement heads from your local wholesale warehouse and  before you know it, you are marketted another revolutionary shaving idea.4. COLOR/DESIGN.  The color is really wonderful and in time for Spring, but displaying it with your white ShowerPod may not fit all bathrooms.  Yes, it\'s a shaver but it still is built to be displayed within easy reach at the shower for convenience.  But give us a more neutral color like WHITE!  In fact make an ALL WHITE SHAVER and call it the GILLETTE VENUS ANGEL.  Together with the ShowerPod, that should be a better option for most bathroooms.CONCLUSION:Yes, the Venus Embrace is great.  You have created a five blade system and beat the competition once again.  The gel handle is the highlight of this release together with a very big shave head to help create an even smoother experience.However...What I would really like consumers to experience is a better shaving system with a head that lasts longer.  With all the manufacturing techniques, why not create blades that are not only sharper, but also maintains the sharpness.  This should be more convenient than having to stack up tons of replacement blades in the bathroom.  Make use of stronger and lighter materials like Schick\'s use of TITANIUM.  How about go seal the deal in technology and create a PORCELAIN-coated BLADE.  Anything as long as you can give us an idea that you also care for us to save.  In turn, we will create the illusion that we will also be loyal to the brand until the day we die.I still have a problem with the close spacing of the blades creating clogged hair in between them.  The idea of more blades will create cutting shaving time may not hold true since you will have to do more steps in loosening the hair particles in water.Overall, this is another winner in shaving experience.  But it\'s what we would expect from a manufacturer who wants to introduce better technology and ensure a steady replacement of expensive shave heads.    "

It\'s a nice entry -- it gives a nice shave with no nicks or cuts, and it\'s attractive. It even comes with a cute \'showerpod\' that attaches to your shower wall and holds the razor.However, there are several downsides to the Embrace:* The razors don\'t last long at ALL. I shaved my legs twice without replacing the head, and the second time was really not that satisfactory. In addition, the refills are PRICEY! They end up being over $2 apiece at the Amazon price or more than $3 apiece at the regular retail price.* The multiple blades trap longer hairs, so if it\'s been more than a couple of days since you\'ve last shaved your legs (so sue me -- it\'s not exactly shorts weather in Michigan right now!), you\'ll find yourself CONSTANTLY rinsing out the head.

I can run the razor over my skin fast, with very light pressure, and it still shaves perfectly. For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area. With every other razor (even the Breeze, which was my prior favorite) I had to slow way down and go carefully or I\'d nick myself in those spots. So I can shave faster! I shave in the shower, and I don\'t find shave gel or foam to be necessary.My problems with razor burn and bumps in the underarm and bikini area are over. Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions. With previous razors I had to shave those spots repeatedly in different directions, using a lot of pressure, to get a close shave. That lead to painful razor burn, and so most of the time I just tolerated a rough shave there. No more! I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure. Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.There are two things I don\'t like about the Embrace cartridges:Cost: They\'re expensive! But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher cost.The size: They\'re big. The only reason this is a problem for me is the shower pod: Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they *don\'t* fit in the Breeze shower pod.  I ended up buying an Embrace starter pack with a handle and shower pod so I could store the cartridges in the shower pod.  I didn\'t realize until I opened the starter pack that the Embrace shower pod only holds *two* cartridges. So when you open a 4-pack of cartridges, you\'ll have to keep the extra cartridges somewhere else. One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else. It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \'cute\' over making it useful for storage. At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall so it doesn\'t get knocked onto the shower floor and stepped on.(Another reviewer reported that the shower pod keeps detaching from the wall. I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn\'t get bumped and rarely gets splashed. It\'s remained firmly attached for months. I also have a fiberglass shower. I don\'t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy tile.)Summary: The Embrace cartridge gives a truly superior shave. It\'s worth every cent.EDIT: April 11, 2011: Wouldn\'t you know it, shortly after I wrote this glowing review I got a bad batch. The bad cartridges didn\'t shave as smoothly and I had some mild razor burn with them. They also seemed to dull more quickly. Since the bad batch I had tried another box and they worked well again. I am not changing my five-star rating yet, but I will be paying attention to whether the bad box was a fluke, or a warning of quality control problems.    "

I don\'t want to smell like my deodorant, and the Cool Wave fragrance is very subtle. Also, my wife likes the smell, so that is an obvious plus!3) It seems to last longer than other brands including other gels.

Over time some of the other gels I\'ve bought lose their texture or melt if they\'re not kept cool enough. I don\'t have that problem with Gillette. I can take it to the gym, leave it in my gym bag in a hot car all day long, and it still works perfectly later.Amazon sells these for a very reasonable price compared even with a place like SAMS, so if you like this deodorant, stock up and save some money.

First thing he noticed was that he had to turn the wheel (pushing the product upward) many many times to get it to reach the surface where it could be used.  Therefore, it is obvious that the container is not completely full, and therefore the user is actually getting less product than the size of the container would imply.  The directions say \'three clicks.\'  Yeah, right.  That may be true after the first use, but certainly not true for the initial use.  Also, the name of the anti-perspirant includes the words \'advanced solid,\' but the stuff that exuded from the little holes in the top sure looks like a thick cream.Other than that, all he could say about the product is that it seems to be a perfectly adequate anti-perspirant.  Even though he is a very active guy, he was neither negatively nor positively impressed.  Maybe he had a rather neutral reaction to it because he is just not the type of guy who stays awake at night wondering if he has damp spots on his shirt in the summertime that might gross-out his coworkers.In any case, he felt that the product does the job, but he wondered if it was worth the price differential over other brands.  For roughly the same amount of money, one can purchase four-packs of other name-brand anti-perspirants that work (in his estimation) just as well.    "

It went on smooth and comfortably and it disappeared and was dry very quickly.Protection wise it\'s great.  When I read that it has a masking fragrance I was concerned that masking might mean overpowering or I\'d smell like freshly washed guy with too much cologne, luckily I was in for a surprise.  The scent of this, on application, is almost unnoticeable- it does smell a little bit like \'unscented deodorant\' (which to my sensitive nose still has a scent) but then nothing- absolutely nothing.  I was thrilled! I have a sensitive nose and sensitive skin and neither were agitated by Gillette clinical strength anti-perspirant.I think this would be great for people who sweat a ton or if working hard in a very humid environment.

For years (since about age 15 - I\'m 42 now) I\'ve found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it\'s simply a \'clean\' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don\'t find it competing with my perfume and haven\'t noticed it to be overpowering.Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.The product isn\'t invisible and will get on your clothes if you\'re not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can\'t find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about \'pitting out\' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.    "

I don\'t even stink of sweat, I just sweat out of my underarms alot.  Once a coworker even commented on it at my shirt and tie client facing job, recommending I change the brand of antiperspirant I use--but it wasn\'t like I didn\'t know I had this problem so it wasn\'t any more embarassing than the problem itself, now solved by great products like this one.  This not only helps me personally, but professionally as well.So I\'ve been using Degree prescription strength antiperspirant for about a year and a half now, and when the opportunity came up to try out a sample of this Gillette version I merely thought it would save me ten dollars.  Instead, I will be buying this from now on.What\'s the difference?  The active ingredient is the same and in the same amount--so one is just as effective as the other--and they both have moisturizers and such so that they don\'t irritate my underarms.  But the applicators are different in design and I have to say Gillette wins on this aspect alone.DESIGN / APPLICATOR: On the Degree product, the place on the applicator where the cream comes out is about the size of a quarter, whereas on the Gillette version it\'s wide enough to cover my entire underarm so I don\'t have to do circles with it to make sure I applied completely.  I believe this also causes me to use less of it, which makes it last longer and therefore is a better value.COMFORT: I noticed that with the Gillette product they seem to have put something in it that gives me a nice cooling sensation when I apply it.  It\'s very subtle, and very nice.  Degree, nor any other antiperspirant I\'ve ever tried, doesn\'t seem to have this.  I also feel the Gillette product is more comfortable.EFFECTIVENESS: As I wrote above, literally no difference in effectiveness between the Degree and Gillette products.  Same active ingredient, in the same amount.SCENT: The Gillette product that I sampled--the one on this page--has so little scent to it that we could say it practically has none.  It smells like and about as strong as Aveno moisturizer.  The Dove product, for comparison, smells really good, but not so strong that people notice it when you\'re near them.  I like the Gillette scent, or lack thereof, better.BOTTOM LINE: I didn\'t think this sample would cause me to change clinical strength antiperspirant from the brand I\'ve been using for years, but it did.  You should definitely try both and decide for yourself which one you prefer, but for me the clear winner is Gillette.    "

The one thing about this product that I found a little different is that I really couldn\'t smell any fragrance with it, so it was hard to even tell if I had it on, one time I forgot if I put it on and I had no way of telling so I had to reapply.  I also had one or two days that I was using this where I still smelled a little bit sweaty by the end of the day, but I think that would happen with just about anything.

The sticky that comes from not removing all of the grease from the outside of the baby.  Just sticky.  I quit using it then.

I thought that these couldn\'t be that much different but I was wrong.The first thing that I noticed was that these razor\'s don\'t glide on my skin like the Mach3. I get annoying nicks and scrapes with this razor and they are a pain to deal with because they take a few days to heal. I also don\'t feel these are cutting as close as the Mach3. Sometimes I want to do a third pass but I am scared that I will introduce more cuts. The Mach3 made my face feel so smooth and even after two passes with this razor, I still feel rough areas.I always wash my face before I shave and use shaving cream and I still have a problem with nicks.I will not be buying these again. I will either go back to the Mach3 or I will use the Schick Hydro.I\'ve used the Mach3 since around 1999 and I think it is the perfect razor. All the other stuff that has come after the Mach3 is not really that much better IMO.I don\'t recommend these blades.    "

I\'ve been using Gillette Mach3 Turbo blades for years, and frankly got tired of paying $3.05/per blade at my local grocery store. I shopped Amazon to look for a cheaper price, and came across these Sensor3 disposable blades which are getting fantastic reviews (for some reason). I thought I\'d give them a try, seeing how they\'re almost 1/2 the cost (per blade) as my non-disposable Turbo blades. WHAT A MISTAKE! These blades are comparatively very dull right out of the box compared to the Turbo blades, and I\'m lucky if I can get 3 shaves out of them before needing to throw them away. Worse yet, they do NOT provide a close shave, they nick the hell out of my face, and sometimes that occurs on the very first use of a brand-new blade. Still, I thought I better do a cost comparison, since the Turbo blades are so much more expensive. So, here\'s the net-net:Sensor3 Disposables: $1.57/per razor, $0.52/per shave (based on 3-shave average per blade)Mach3 Turbo Non-Disposable: $3.05/per razor, $0.43/per shave (based on 7-shave average per blade)When you factor in that I\'m getting a much closer and complete shave with the Mach3, virtually zero nicks (I average probably 1x every 6 months at most), and better pricing on my Mach3\'s online, I\'m not going to be buying any more Sensor3 blades...

I think that the lubricating strip is better than most when I first use the razor.However, the lubricating strips don\'t last quite as long as other razors I\'ve used and I find myself wanting to replace them after about 5 shaves (I kept my previous razors for about 7).  In contrast to my other experiences, the blades are still sharp, but the lubricating strip is completely gone.  For what it\'s worth, I keep my razor in the shower -- I assume it\'s possible that they will last longer if I keep it elsewhere.Because of the good shave at first, I continue to subscribe to these razors.

I needed the travel bag, and it was only (...) for the bag and all the free stuff, so it was a no-brainer).What I like about this razor:1. It\'s pink.2. It\'s thin, girly and cute.3. It\'s comfortable to hold.4. It has the built-in shaving gel.Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 of those are all really superficial and don\'t amount to much.What I don\'t like about this razor:1. The very first thing I noticed about it is that there is a slimy, goopy gook that stretches (picture okra or chicken slime when you\'re cleaning it) as you shave. It is absolutely, positively gross and unsightly. Perhaps I\'m making too big a deal of that, but I have a weak stomach, and that really grossed me out.2. I wet my legs, turned the shower off, and sat down inside.  After I shaved my right leg, I immediately began shaving my left leg (I had some Nair on my bikini area, so I didn\'t have time to waste). While I was shaving my left leg, my right leg began to sting. After about two minutes, it became unbearable, so even though the time wasn\'t up on my Nair and I hadn\'t quite finished my left leg, I had to get under some running water.  THAT MADE IT WORSE!!! Both my legs began to burn! Discomfort is an understatement. I was in pain! I don\'t normally have sensitive skin, and this was the first time I\'ve ever had a shaving product to make me feel that way. It was absolutely unbearable.So bad that I actually had to write a review. I think in my entire life, I may have been compelled to write a review once or twice. That\'s how bad this experience was. So it\'s been about 15 minutes since I got out the shower. My legs aren\'t burning anymore, and they feel somewhat smooth. Not as smooth as my regular razor (Schick Intuition - which is nice and gives great results, but so bulky and big), but it\'ll do. I don\'t think the blades on this Spa Breeze got as close as I would like.All in all, I would never buy this razor.    "

Its \'white tea\' fragrance is pleasing but mild, and I think it would pass muster with most sensitive noses.  The grip is comfortable even in my nondominant hand, and the light pink color is very subtle--not too girlie.  About the only minor gripe that I had with the Sea Breeze is that it comes with a bulky holding case that can be mounted on the wall of a shower.  The case is intended to store the razor and a couple of blade-and-soap cartridges, but it was not too esthetic so I just didn\'t install it.  Otherwise,this item deserves a high recommendation.

Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn\'t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough. The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin. This interference can also lead to nicks because it\'s difficult to gauge how much pressure to apply to get the razor to meet skin. The gel bars, the selling point of this product, are meant to be a substitute for soap or some other shaving gel. But if you tend to use soap anyway, they are superfluous.That said, this is a decent razor. Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.    "

She shave gel - I like it for shaving my legs, but didn\'t care for it while shaving my arm pits. Also, the gel kind of goops, at first especially, and we found it kind of gooping off of she razor when not in use. I also found that while shaving arm pits, you need to apply some pressure to get the blades close to your skin - well, I don\'t like to do that when shaving there.

The triple blades are usually very long lasting, but with the irritating little pads dragging along your shaving surface, the long-life blades become an unusable waste. If your skin\'s not sensitive, this might not be an issue.That said, it does give a great shave, even on bikini line, and it is very handy to have an all-in one for travel.    "

So it came as some surprise that this latest generation really did up the ante a bit from a performance standpoint.  Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven\'t so much as gotten a nick.  I\'ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  While I haven\'t attempted to use the razor without shaving cream, as the claims say you can (I have dry/sensitive skin that I feared would not react well), I will say that I think the skin of my legs gets less dry with this razor and I almost didn\'t need body lotion afterward.The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  The razor comes with a case that I believe is intended to adhere to the wall of your shower, with storage for razor blades, which come individually packaged.  I don\'t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can\'t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.The only downside - and one that isn\'t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.  If only you could use the blade to shave the price!  That said, this product is so good that if you\'re trying to select between comparably priced razors/blades from competitors, I strongly recommend you try this one - I think you\'ll be pleased in every way.

It is similar to the Embrace Venus razor, but the Embrace has rubberized strips that make the blades float above the skin.  The Venus Spa Breeze Razor has two strips of very hard milled soap on the top and bottom so that you do not have to use soap or shaving cream/lotion when you shave.The soap is not overly scented.  It is not overly lathery either, which surprised me.  It is quite solid and does not melt easily, which is good because you won\'t blow through the soap before you finish the razor in sharpness.The soap does have sodium lauryl sulfate (and some relatives) in it which I avoid in my skin care products, but it is not a large amount and it did not leave my skin parched when I got done using it.The storage rack that comes with the Spa Breeze Razor is nice but I don\'t like the way it attaches to the wall.  It has two square adhesive strips that you are supposed to attach to a clean shower wall and then hang the case up on it with little knobs that hook it in.  I don\'t like that idea- there is too much risk of sticky being left behind being yet another challenge in cleaning the walls of the shower once it has lived through its usefulness and has to be removed.I have given this four stars because of the case mounting idea, and the fact that I don\'t like this razor quite as much as the EMBRACE by Venus.

The Green Tea scent is very \'spa-like\' and feminine.  The blade contours all the nooks and crannies of my body wonderfully and there wasn\'t one nick at all.  Over the years I have been a loyal follower of the \'Intuition\' razor and \'Veet\' line.  I don\'t like buying shaving cream seperately and find that the cream clogs the razor from doing its job after all.  The downfall of the \'Intuition\' was that the head was rather clunky at about an inch height and the soap part would wear down rather quickly.The Venus has a soft pink head that is actually very gel-like in feeling.  I used it to shave my legs, under arms and bikini area and haven\'t seen any wear on the jelly heads that surround the blades.  The actual handle feels great in my hand; especially the little spot on the head where I place my finger to control the pressure that I apply whilst shaving.  Very thoughtful product that was truly tested.  My one only complaint at the time is that shaved hair gets caught underneath the jelly sides.  I have to manually go and remove all the hair each time.... which is rather annoying.You get two head cartridges with that delightful scent and case that will hold the cartridges and handle.  You can even hang it with the \'stickies\' supplied.  I haven\'t tried the \'stickies\' because from past experience they either fall or they stick to the tile forever while the product is on the floor.  I wish companies would jump on the suction cup back like the \'Intuition\' provides.Highly recommend the product because I did not have one nick or any bumps after shaving.

The package does, however, promote that because of the spa strips you don\'t need to use shaving cream.  Although you don\'t get a bad shave (IE razor burn, irritation,etc) without shaving cream, when using it with shaving cream, it leaves the skin a lot smoother and more moisturized.  Overall, if you already have a Venus system, this is not really a necessary upgrade, but if you\'re looking for a new shaving system, this one is great and will not disappoint.    "

I love having a disposable with the built-in moisturizing strips so that I don\'t have to carry shaving gel or rely on hotel soap or shampoo. I don\'t often like scented products -- I like to choose my own scents -- but the scent of the moisturizing strips/gel bars is subtle and unobtrusive.

This is a big switch from most ladies razors I have tried. Because the blades are sealed, they don\'t loose their moisturizing gel every time you turn on the shower. The casing comes with a little mounting bracket that is not hard to place or figure out. I have really bad eyesight, so fishing around for a razor without my glasses on can be entertaining.The razor and stem are ridiculously feminine. It really does go right past any attempt at simple functionality and well into something a 14 year old girl would throw a tantrum for. It\'s marvelous. The stem is a very elegant swirly pearl color with all these interesting rubber bits that make it easy to hold. It is easy to hold. I think you\'d really have to make an effort to drop it regardless of how soaped up you get. But you won\'t drop it because you will not want to.The blades are surrounded by these wide pink lip like things that look, to be quite honest, like something you\'d find in a adult movie used by the goddess of immaculate hairlessness. They are squishy and smell wonderful. They also work quite well if you get them damp so you can have a safe dry shave, or touch up.The Venus Breeze razor is really over the top but does function quite well.

All you have to do is wet it and begin shaving since the soap-like pieces above and below the blades turn to a clear substance the consistency of (sorry!) mucous as you shave.  The handle is molded to fit comfortably in your hand, although the weight feels more like a disposable.This pack comes with two sealed blades -- airtight so as not to dry out the lubricant.  Herein lies the first problem:  instead of a neat row of blades in a small holder, you get individual pods.  For this reason, the packaging is bulky, and it seems like a very non-green approach to razor blades.I use a Gillette Quattro as my primary blade, so I compared the two.  I used the Venus Breeze without soap of any kind, and I used the Quattro with my usual Dove Body Wash.  The Quattro shaved slightly closer, although this wasn\'t obvious until the second day.  My skin was noticeably drier on the Venus Breeze leg, however.  The best news is that the lubricant worked since I had no razor burn or other discomfort while shaving.I recommend this razor primarily for travel when you don\'t want to take cream or gel for shaving and you can pop a pod into your bag.  Because the lubricant is solid, you don\'t need to put anything in the airport carry-on quart size bag, which frees up more room for other items.This razor works exactly as advertised, although I suspect it will end up because more expensive than most choice simply because of the cost of replacement blades.

I started out as the package suggested, in the shower and wetting the razor, then when that burned as I stroked, I made sure that my legs were wet too.  Even that wasn\'t enough; hours later I can feel where each swathe of the razor went. I can also feel how nice and smooth my legs are. It gives a close shave.

I would say it lasted about a month, and in that time, I was shocked at what a time saver it is not to have to apply shaving cream!  It did take some getting used to in the beginning figuring out the angle to get the best cut with the upper and lower moisturizing bars sticking out further than the blade, but now it\'s a \'breeze\'.  It\'s also nice that you don\'t have to worry about applying shaving cream to hard to reach places or that it will wash off - it\'s always on your razor!  As a busy mom with a one and three year old, I\'m not shaving every day, but I definitely found myself shaving more often because it took less time.  Now that the moisturizing bar has worn off, the razor is still sharp and I can still use it with shaving cream.

So what you are left with is a razor with NO lubrication, and you end up having to use soap or shaving cream anyway if you want to get the full life out of your blade.

It does stick to its promise in that it doesn\'t show on your clothing. Black or otherwise. (if you accidentally put on too much then it will show)While I did find that the scent hits you very strongly at first it does tone down shortly after applying. Oddly enough others asked what I was wearing and told me it was very pleasant.Applying this deodorant was fairly easy. With other stick deodorants it feels like you\'re rubbing a rock under your arm, uncomfortable. This was unlike others and applied smoothly.The big minus:Kind of uncomfortable. While application is pretty smooth actually wearing it is not. After wearing it for a couple of hours it begins to, for lack of a better word, chafe. The downfall of stick deodorant begins to shine through. As the moisture of the deodorant begins to disappear you are left with a powdery irritating feeling.The Rundown:I work in an office and don\'t really find myself in the situations where I\'m sweating profusely. Because of this the anti-perspiration factor is, to me, not needed. A product that is strictly deodorant tends to work best.I\'ll be sticking to my Old Spice Red Zone.

This razor feels very comfortable in my hand and perhaps even lighter than most razors.  Traditionally, I have shyed away from Gillette razors as they have a tendency to provide a more painful shave for me.  There seems to be more tugging and pulling then other razors I have used.  I have always found that a Schick Titanium typically gives me a more comfortable shave.  The Proglide is no exception as I still found it to be pulling a bit much to my disappointment.  I also noticed a bit more irritation on my face the next day, but nothing too bad.  However, I will say that this is, by far, the closest shave I have ever had with any razor.  I believe I actually said \'wow\' when I was done shaving.  In my mind I had to determine what the trade off was.  More comfortable versus closest shave.  For now, I am sticking with the Gillette in hopes that my face gets a little more used to it.I knocked off two stars for the following reasons:1) Price!  The razor is not too expensive, but a 4 pack of blades is about $16 at my local gorcery store.  By far, the most expensive blades in the aisle.2) Lack of comfort...it tugs and pulls a bit...and left my face slightly irritated.Overall, its a good razor.

My biggest gripe though is that only after a few times because the blades in the cartridge are so thin, the razor does become quickly dull to the edge. So even to the visible eye, you lose that shave and you\'d have to earn those wings by quickly getting a refill for your Gilette razor.

It was (and still is) a truly revolutionary, advanced and innovative shaving system that made shaving virtually painless and hastle-free even for men with tough beards and/or sensitive skin. The ProGlide is the latest incarnation of the Fusion and it does offer some advantages over the original Fusion but not nearly enough to justify switching over (especially when considering that the replacement cartridges will be even more expensive than the manual Fusion\'s!). When I shaved my head with the ProGlide, I honestly noticed NO difference whatsoever (neither better nor worse) than when I shave with the manual Fusion. When shaving my face, I did notice that the ProGlide DID do a slightly better job than the manual Fusion at shaving tricky and hard-to-reach areas (especially the moustache area just below the nostrils and around my Adam\'s apple) but this is probably because the ProGlide\'s cartridges are supposedly 15% thinner than the Fusion\'s. I should also point out that the ProGlide\'s handle feels more sturdy and offers a (somewhat) tighter grip than the (manual or Power) Fusion\'s and that the design is more elegant but (of course) beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The Bottom Line: Fusion ProGlide offers some minor improvements over the manual Fusion but nowherenear enough to justify upgrading to an even more expensive product when an already excellent one is available.

When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had.

I still feel the additional blades (over 3) does not contribute to the closer shave. It is a result of the tension strip that stretches your skin as you shave. Although it is a great shave, I don\'t think the additional costs (or blades) justify the extra expense versus a standard 3-blade razor.    "

I can sympathize.  When you go as far as to skip shaving because it\'s too expensive, you know there\'s a problem.However, I\'ve found that the Fusion blades are, like the Mach 3 before them, worth the extra cost.  I have very thick, fast-growing facial hair, which earned me more than my share of scrutiny when I was in the military.  Therefore, I need razors that can cut through it without excessive strokes that each take a bit of skin with them.The Mach 3 was a huge improvement over dual-blade razors for me, and for quite a while I stuck with those rather than paying a premium for the Fusion 5-blades.  Also affecting my decision was the old Onion article: \'**** Everything, We\'re Doing Five Blades,\' which reinforced my perception that a five-bladed razor was nothing but a marketing gimmick.And perhaps it is - but it shaves noticeably better than the Mach 3, either because of the additional blades or some other less-obvious improvements.  Not only do I get a better shave with fewer strokes, but I can even skip a couple days and then cut through the beginnings of a hoary beard with little effort.And even better, the new razors seem to last longer than the Mach 3s, giving half a dozen shaves or more before they need replacement.  The Mach 3s gave up the ghost after just 3 or so.I certainly recommend these razors if the cost is not a huge obstacle, especially if you\'ve got facial hair from hell like I do.    "

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.

When I first started shaving, I used a disposable manual razor. Twice. After that, realizing shaving wasn\'t something one could usually get out of by choice, I bought an electric razor, of the rotary type. When the Gillette Mach 3 was introduced, I got that to keep for a backup, or for a closer shave for important events, concerts, shows, etc. Eventually I upgraded my rotary razor to a Braun Pulsonic (expensive) razor. Soon after, I tried the Gillette Fusion Power, to see how it compared. Lets just say it compared just enough to be actually worth comparing. This again went into the cabinet as a special occasional razor. About three months ago, as the cartridge in my Braun Pulsonic was aging beyond it\'s recommended life cycle and the shave was getting less close, and more painful, I decided to try the Gillette Proglides cartridges. I used them on my Gillette Fusion Power handle, since it\'s basically the same as the Proglide handle.Here was my experience with not one but four separate cartridges:I decided to shave at roughly the same time every day, just to get a real good idea of how it performed in relation to my electric. I also shaved the day prior, with my electric.The very first shave was very smooth and close, with no tug and pull, just as advertised. I was surprised, but pleased. It did tend to nick up my face pretty bad, but the blades were sharp enough so it didn\'t affect comfort. I shave well in advance of leaving home, so this wouldn\'t have been a big deal. The second and subsequent shaves were dramatically different from the first one. All were painful, rough, uneven, and frankly not all that close. I was close to just heading back to the Pulsonic with two year (plus) old cartridge, but I decided to stick it out. As the strip of lubricant wore down significantly, the comfort of the shave improved. It wasn\'t as close, but it was almost, if not as comfortable as the first. This lasted until the strip was nearly gone, and it was clearly time to replace.I decided at that point to return to my Pulsonic, and just buy the new cartridge, as it had served me well for two years on one cartridge.A few weeks later, I had an interview, so I bought a three cartridge set of the Proglide cartridges. I decided that after I used the one for the interview, I would use the other two to do a slightly different test.With the final two cartridges, I decided to wait varying periods of time between shaves, so the stubble would be a different length each time.Overall, the results were the same as the first time, with a few differences. Any shave of stubble that was between two days and five days old was much more comfortable and close than it would have been at the same point in the cartridge life cycle with shorter stubble. The longest stubble, which was about six days growth, resulted in a shave that was less close, but as comfortable as the other longer-stubble shaves.I don\'t know whether my rate of stubble growth is typical or atypical, but I can grow a nice goatee in about a week.Overall, I think that Gillette is going in the right direction, but they need to strike a finer balance between shave quality, and longevity of blades in order to make these worthwhile.After all the hype (which I tried to ignore, but who can, really?) I was expecting something different, and much improved. Frankly, even the few times when I turn to a manual razor, I would probably turn to the old Fusion, just because I didn\'t have as many guessing games. It worked until it stopped, which was just before the color from the strip was gone. Even for someone who shaves primarily with a manual razor, unless they have money to blow, I wouldn\'t recommend the Proglide.Overall, my opinion is that this is a debatable improvement over the previous generation, and that it was so far over-hyped that it created false expectations. Had it not been hyped so much as a dramatic improvement, I might have given it four stars, but that type of advertising really irks me.NOTE: This was my experience with the product, and since this sort of product depends a lot on individual faces, hair, shaving habits, etc., it\'s not good to draw a conclusion based solely on a few other reviews. In addition, different people expect different things from a razor. I prefer a balance of longevity, comfort and closeness, while others prefer one over the others. My opinion is: if you\'re an owner of a Fusion handle, you can always get a small pack of the Proglide cartridges and try them out. They may well work differently for you.    "

That is proof of the pudding with their Gilette Fusion Proglide Power razor, and their refill cartridges. While the concept is right with the closeness of a shave, the big gripe about it is that the cartridges quickly get dull only after a few uses. That dullness gets very tiresome, even with the toughest of shaving creams and mixes to make it easier for your best shave.

I upgraded to the Gillette Mach3 when it came out, and I was pretty happy with the results.  Now, after a year of using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide, I\'m going back to the Mach3.The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide does provide a close shave.  It\'s the closest I\'ve ever had, to be honest.  The problem is that the blades get too dull to use within a week.  Oh, I could still use them, but then I\'d be tugging at hair instead of cutting through the hair.  My Mach3\'s cartridges would last three months before hitting the waste basket.  And the vibrating mechanism doesn\'t do a lick of good, either.  I have had just as good of results when leaving the battery powered vibrator off.Now, if I could afford to spend $100 a year on razor cartridges, I would stick with the Pro Glide.

He\'s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.His current razor is a Mach 3, so he did side by side comparisons between that one and this Fusion Proglide. He did the typical half-the-face test where he shaved each half with one of the razors. He did comparison tests where he tried it powered and non-powered.For all of these tests, the result - the shave closeness - was about the same. This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.As for the *process* of shaving. running the Fusion Proglide with the power off felt similar to using the Mach 3. However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \'pull\' - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  I\'ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.He was expecting the trimmer blade to be pretty useless - but it turns out it was pretty convenient for trimming. You can\'t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.He used it for a half dozen shaves, and the blade still has a little life left, which is on par with a Mach 3.For people who already have a Mach 3 and didn\'t care about the \'shaving process itself\', there\'s no real reason to change blades. People who are having issues with tugging and pulling might appreciate the smoother shaving experience with the Proglide.On the issue of blade cost, if you buy the Proglide blades in bulk, you can get blades closer to $3 a blade. Still, this can seem expensive compared with other options.In the end we\'re hoping when we run out of Mach 3 blades that the blades for this one might have dropped in price and we\'ll move over to the Proglide. However, but it\'s not like we\'d toss out the Mach 3 and the existing blades in order to use this.    "

Probably spent thousands of dollars on these contraptions, and for what??--as I\'ve learned, the shave you get from the cartridge razors is simply not as good as old-fashioned straight razor and safety razor shaves. If you don\'t take yourself seriously as a man and as a connoisseur, than by all means, stick with cartridge razors and waste money to boot. But if you value the lofty experience, the pinnacle of manly class and style, try out traditional shaving.I switched to a safety razor rather than move up to the Proglide. I\'m glad I did.The best shave you can get, of course, is from a professional barber with a profesionally-maintained straight razor. But that\'s an occasional treat, unless you have the time to go to your barbershop every morning and afternoon for shaves (I hope that tradition makes a comeback, though). Maintaining a straight razor at home is time-consuming. And you have to treat shaving with more care and caution, lest you bloody your shower as in a scary horror flick. The good medium compromise is the famous safety razor, which is making a comeback these days. You buy a safety razor handle, made of heavy metal, usually stainless steel. It feels good, heavy, solid in your hand. You buy an inexpensive supply of safety razor blades. Easy to replace, they last about 1-2 weeks per double-sided blade, dependng on beard thickness. Standard safety blades will do you fine, and they\'re much, much less expensive than constantly buying cartridges which clog and wear out quickly (if you want the best safety razor blades, [...] ([...]) has cryo-treated safety blades that last five times as long as regular safety blades, so you save even more money).Then, you buy several shaving soaps and soap dishes, for variety if you like, which are better for your skin than mass-market aerosol shaving gels. The mass-market stuff is junk. Traditional shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful. The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave. I keep five different soaps in my shower in separate bowls so i can switch depending on my mood for scents. You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man\'s lifestyle.Simply put, safety razors and straight razors give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price. And btw, a quality aftershave treatment will also be very good for your skin, it does make a difference. Due to the greater time-consumption of maintaining a straight razor, I suggest trying a safety razor outfit first.    "

2418,1998,2070,20100702,B003987CL0,1,"July 2, 2010",AU70G084OYMMM,Nothing special about this razor when compared to the others.,"I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age. The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better but that was always not the case. So I\'ll briefly compare this to the other razors I\'ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel. The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade. Thats all I have to say about that.The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner. Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same. So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave but I still decided to stick with the comfort of the Mach 3. So up till now the Mach 3 was my razor of choice.Now the story changes a bit:I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided. I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking I would never use anything else. BAD DECISION!!!! My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power. At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I\'m getter older so it\'s my skin\'s fault. I would get ingrown hairs and it was then embarrassing to go out. I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved. I tried various skin treatments to rid of the irritations and redness but nothing would work. The problem with the fusion was that the blades would only last about 3 shaves and then irritate the hell out of your face. ONE DAY I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY ANOTHER RAZOR.I then bought the Schick Quattro Titanium and boy was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion. It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever. They would stay sharp for months and wouldn\'t clog if a shave gel was used.(I know people complain that it clogs but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh it doesn\'t).Now Hydro 5 vs. Fusion ProglideHydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5. At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water. The shave was not as close as I would have wanted. The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge. Still I kept on using it since it came with 2 refills anyway. The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.Fusion Proglide: I bought the sneak peek package just to try the razor before it came out and all I can say is AWFULLLLLL!!!!!!! This time I couldn\'t even get one good shave from this crap. Turns shaving into gliding my A$$!!!! It\'s very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot. So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I\'ve ever used so far. The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind the exaggeration but you know what I mean).Final verdict: Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers. They are nothing but marketing now. Up until the Mach 3 they were my razor brand but the fusion and fusion proglide are nothing but scams. They look cool but I think they are face wreckers. Then again I have sensitive skin so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise. Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help. So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin. It will not clog with Zirh or Anthony Logistics shave gel and causes no irritation. The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates. Sorry for long review but I just had to share my experience.    "

This razor, however, is truly a giant step forward - I feel like Gillette is in the unfortunate position of having to market this as a slight improvement on a stock Fusion rather than a new line altogether, despite the fact that it is really leaps and bounds ahead of the older model.The razor glides over my face with no catching, no scraping feeling, and no irritation, all while delivering an incredibly close shave. I truly don\'t see how Gillette will be able to improve on this.(I promise I\'m not a paid employee of Gillette, I just think this product is really outstanding).    "

I now use a simple old fashion safety razor which works great and the blades are dirty cheap.  Now I won\'t disagree that the Fusion cuts fine and I can shave in record time without fear of removing my Adam\'s apple but $4 a blade is just robbery.  For the most part I think I\'ll stick to safety razor for the bulk of my shaving and then finish up the \'scary\' areas with the Fusion.  This prolongs the life of the Fusion.  The safety razor actually works better if you let your whiskers grow longer as since it\'s single blade it never clogs.If you currently use the old Fusion then I fail to see any benefit in this new model.  I\'m sure they have some lovely marketing but in the end it\'s 98% the same and I couldn\'t tell the difference.  Perhaps the biggest fluff is the \'power\' feature.  It\'s completely useless and IMO is just an attempt to add another disposable item to this razor.  I\'m not sure who asked for their razor to shake in their hands but that\'s not what I want while I\'m shaving around my lips or throat.  I wound up keeping it off while I shave.  I\'m also still not a fan of the flip back behavior of the Fusion... I prefer the head to stay still but since this isn\'t new then maybe you\'re fine with it.Overall it\'s a fine razor, but it\'s a marketing (not engineering) upgrade with goals to charge you just a bit more per blade but it\'s already too much IMO.

For me it has changed the way I feel about shaving tenfold. The fusion was good but I still had issues with razor burn. The proglide changed all that. Usually I go about a day in between shaving. After buying the Proglide on Saturday and shaving that evening, I didn\'t shave till Tuesday night & that\'s cause I wanted to. I could have went a couple more days but I like a smooth head so I shaved. I couldn\'t believe how close a shave I got with this blade and went for days without any razor burn or irritation at all and that\'s going with the grain. I always liked going against the grain cause it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was, my head couldn\'t take the pain afterwards so I stuck with going with the grain. With the Proglide I\'m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road I\'ll give it a shot because just going with the grain I get a damn close shave. I know it won\'t be the case for some other people but for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years. Highly, HIGHLY recommend buying this prduct.    "

First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  However, once you power it on, the vibration allows it to glide smoothly over your body.  When I shave with my normal razors I always get pin hole knicks all over my body (about 8-15) and come out of the shower bleeding. With this razor, I only had one knick--simply amazing. Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.I also had my boyfriend try it and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily but he could get use to that.

I have all the products - the Merkur\'s safety razors, the Gillette Fatboy, and as assortment of straight razors from Dovo and Thiers Issard.  There is nothing more that I enjoy than lathering up my Rooney silvertip badger and shaving on a weekend morning.  However, for those quick morning shaves before work I always turn to my trusty Gillette, ranging over my shaving career from the Sensor Excel to the Mach III to the Fusion and now the Proglide.  I have to say, each has been an improvement over the previous, with the newest generation being the best.Gillette loves to throw in the marketing gimmicks - the \'enlarged lubrastrip\', the \'redesigned precision trimmer\', the \'micro-combs\', and the \'thinner, finer blades.\'  All of these are just lovely ways of saying - hey, we are not giving you a different colored fusion razor like the phenom or racecar or matrix of whatever they called the other Fusions.What I can say, is that somehow with all these \'innovations\', they have managed to minorly improve an already stellar razor.  It does what it says, it glides better on your face.  It have me a 9/10 shave with one pass with the grain in 1 minute of time with no irritation.  You maybe able to get a 10/10 baby butt smooth shave with a Thiers Issard straight blade with a careful four pass 15 minute shaving, but who has time for that!  And it has less tug, less drag than the fusion.Gillette has always been the King of shaving.  The Fusion has put all other over the counter modern safety razors to shame.  This just follows their precedent.  Yeah, it is a Fusion razor with a blue LED light and some minor changes.  But hey!  It\'s great.  It is an all around great razor.  The Proglide will now be my new go to razor for the prework shave.  I give it four stars because it is a great razor, it\'s the best on the market, but it isn\'t perfection.  Gillette is striving towards it.  I want that 10/10 shave.  That may be too much to ask.  But is Gillette thinks they\'ve gotten it complete figured out, they\'ll stop trying.Good job, Gillette.

The blade separation looks different and the hair trimmer is certainly easier to cleaner than previous incarnations of the five blade format. But the shaving process felt no different and the results were certainly no different to my present Fusion electric razor. So I put a new blade in the Fusion and did - to the extent possible - a subjective side by side comparison of the Proglide and the Fusion. They seemed the same to me.We all know that the Gillette - now P & G - consumer model is on the blade replacement rather than the razor - but this version of the 5-blade seems to lack sufficient advancement in the technology to provide a better shave, The New Yorker columnist,  Adam Gopnik, actually wrote a nice piece on the razor wars that can be found as \'Reflections, \'The Fifth Blade,\' The New Yorker, May 11, 2009, p. 50 [...]The Proglide would fit right in with Mr. Gopnik\'s conclusions    "

I always though the battery part of the Fusion was pointless, so was the Proglide going to be any better?In a word, no.The overall shave is excellent. I find it slightly smoother and easier on my face than the original Fusion blades, though I still feel the pull and tug around my mouth and just under my chin as I did with the original Fusion blade.But maybe it\'s just me: I do NOT understand the point of a AAA battery to shove in the handle.

I tried with the vibration on and off and detected no difference to the shave except the numbness of my hand.In any case, yes it\'s a better shave than its predecessor, the hair doesn\'t get trapped in the blades as easily either, - but no it\'s not worth the extra cost at this point.

Plus, it was hard to do anything like trim a smart goatee or sideburns, not to mention the heads would wear out periodically, and were expensive to replace.Finally I moved to shaving cream and manual razors, and it was like graduating to the big leagues, or moving from an automatic transmission to a stick-shift. I felt more in control and got a much better shave that lasted all day. But with cheap razors I found I\'d end up with nicks and irritations no matter how carefully I shaved. I\'m the type of shaver who goes against the grain; otherwise, I\'d never get close enough (my beard grows pretty fast).I\'ve tried most of the hyped-up Gillette and Schick razors over the years, and while they were a definite improvement over the throwaway kind, they were never all they were cracked up to be - I just figured razor technology had gone about as far as it could go, and adding more blades or a gimmick like battery power were just oneupmanship between the two major brands to win market share.That is, until I decided to give this Fusion Proglide Power a shot. I should say right up front, I\'ve not used the non-power version, so I can\'t comment on whether the vibration is a gimmick or does something useful. But I will say I haven\'t had a better shave except from a barber! The basic razor (and especially the starter kit) are not expensive, for what they are. The \'hidden\' cost, of course, is the price of the blades (and the Fusion creams if you choose to use their brand). This could be a big drawback for some, but I value the comfortable, nick-free shave this razor gives me and the extra cost is worth it.In my experience, the only better shave you can get is from a straight razor or good safety razor with the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush. But that makes a mess and is hard to master. I was actually going to try that route before I bought the Proglide... now, I don\'t have to! This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well. I\'m used to having to dip my razor in the water, tap it hard on the back, or some other way to unclog the blades after every few strokes. Not so with this one. Maybe because the blades are thinner? I don\'t know, but it just seems like it never clogs, even with some heavy growth to mow. That\'s another big plus in my book.I dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \'system\' of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave. I think those products are overpriced and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well. But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars. Do I wish the blades were cheaper? Sure. But I don\'t mind paying for something when it\'s actually worth the extra money, and to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money. Good job this time around, Gillette.    "

The turning point for me was, when the battery eventually leaked and corroded the internals (handle grip).  Tried the cheap (U$70) Philips battery operated travel-shaver for 6 months.  Unfortunately, I still missed the close-shaves from the blade shavers.  Finally, I took the plunge again - this time the Fusion Proglide Power.I have since been getting good results from it.  Maybe it is just psychology, but I feel that it had a closer shave compared to the Mac3 Power.  So far, after weeks of daily usage, I have not had a blade-change yet.  What I like was the flip over edge, to get a closer cut especially under the nose area, and below the lower lips.On another note, it did not shave too well when I use it with the Fusion HydraGel Moisturizing Shaving Gel.  Perhaps the Gel is too thick and the blades are floating rather than getting closer to the skin.Overall, it was a good investment for now.    "

Then I bought a Gillette manual fusion and stopped laughing.  It was awesome with closer shaving and the blades lasted one month for me!So I just purchased the Proglide Power Razor.  My \'qualified 5 star rating\' is given because the improvement of this razor over my first 5 blade manual Gillette is no where near the improvement seen in moving from the 3 blade to 5 blade system.  There is no night and day difference.  I would not be surprised if the razor by Gillette testing is an improvement.  But the difference I believe is too small to discern for an average user.  It may come down to whether you like the vibration.  I will say that I have not determined if the vibration helps prevent the buildup of hair between the blades which is feasible.  Nevertheless, I love this razor.  It is entirely optional whether you use the power capability or not.  And relative to my older manual 5 blade the handle on this Proglide is much more rounded and comfortable.  It is not heavy at all and in fact is likely very light yet solid if you remove the battery. So I would recommend giving it a try and figure out for yourself how you prefer to use it.  My one caveat at for this early review is that I have not been able to determine how long the blades last but do not expect that to be significantly different, and if I am not mistaken the older blades still fit as well.

I\'ve been keeping a bald head for about 6 weeks now and this razor is a huge improvement from the twin. Several men\'s bald type websites had noted advantages with the 5 blade. Some say power, some say not. If I space it, and use the razor without the power- I notice it on cleanup for sure. My hair was thin on top so either way- that area is smooth. It is the back and parts of the sides that the power delivers on. Now it is written.    "

However I have to admit this razor gives a really comfortable shave. The ergonomics are the best I\'ve come across, well balanced, correctly angled head, substantial weight with battery installed.  The five-blade cluster is more than just gimmickry, it provides a wider shaving area, which is more stable as you shave. The vibrating gimmick is just that, however. It seems to add nothing to the shave and it completely eliminates any tactile feedback, which I find necessary for a good shave. New blades are quite expensive, usually $3-$4 each, pretty steep but you may find the comfort of the shave is worth it (I\'m still unsure). To sum up, pass on the powered version and go with the cheaper \'manual\' version and be prepared to pay a lot for new blades.    "

The wet shaving methods and products are far superior to other shaving mechanisms, but the time it took to safely use a double edge razor took up 25 minutes of my morning for a three pass shave avoiding major nicks along the way.  Using the Proglide I can confidently shave at a pace that is about 4 times faster without nick concerns.  The floating blades so effectively follow the contours of my skin that I get as close as shave as I ever have before.  The benefit of the power micro-vibrating effect is the blade cuts while it \'floats\' over the skin.  It is a great combination to safely cut against the grain in places where I dared not take my double edge razor.  Total time for a wet shave with three passes was about 10 minutes and this was the first time I\'ve used it.  I would expect it to be about 5-7 minutes next time.In defense of double edges, they still remain the best performance/price ratio of any disposable razor.    "

We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs.

In short, are these new Fusion Proglide blades better than the previous Fusion Power/Manual blades? YES.The advertised thinner blades do make a difference: these is less drag and effort applied when I shave with my Fusion Power blade handle (you don\'t need to buy the new Fusion Proglide Power shaver to use these new blades). I find the shave to be much more comfortable and enjoyable with these new Proglide blades than with the Fusion Power ones I\'ve been using for the past 2 years.Is there a significant difference between the Proglide Manual and Power cartridges? Not that I can tell and not enough for me to fork over the extra money for them. The battery-powered handle makes the difference in the shave in my opinion.Another reviewer mentioned that blade maintenance makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE in the longevity of your blades, and that is true. Always clean your blades with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol after each shave to remove the mineral deposits left by your sink water.    "

I even bought them.  But, even though I have no financial reasons constraining my purchase of this example of our \'finest\' technology, I think there could be some misplaced priorities in a society that would spend almost $4 for a razor blade for their razor that vibrates while shaving via a little battery propelled motor.  Do we really need this product to satify our need to look so nice, or could we feed a few more people with the same amount?  Or do we buy it simply because it is the best?  Or, perhaps we need to by this product to assure Gillette makes a fat margin after they pay their marketing people who make up an eight word name for this product (if we count the hyphenated word as two)?  I think men should stop shaving until Gillette finds a way to sell these things for less than $2.  The world would not end if we let our beards grow and reduce their sales to next to nothing.  The worst that would probably happen is they would be forced to sell their company at a huge discount from its current value to a buyer who would pay so little for the company that the blades could be sold for an amount significantly less than $2.  Could we even survuve in a world that no longer produces $4 razor blades?  I bought these blades because they are the best available, but I really do not need the best available.  They really do not do anything of value for me.  I just think it is incredible that we have been sold on the idea that we need a smooth shave.  Now we have guys who shave their heads so they will not reveal their natural loss of hair.  And some guys are shaving their bodies because they think their hair is in the wrong place or their girlfriend or boyfriend do not like hair in the \'wrong\' place.  I think our thoughts are in the wrong place.  I believe we all have the right to appear the way we wish.  But I also have the right to chuckle at my self and others who think $4 razor blades are great stuff.  I rated this product with five stars because it works well, but I reduced it to three stars because it is so unnecessary.  While this is an unnecessary product, it has no real objectionable purpose other than its reflection of how we squander our assets at time when we criticize our government for its outrageous spending choices that are driving our country to financial failure.  In conclusion, do we have the moral authority to demand a like reduction in our wasteful government spending while we continue to buy $4 razor blades.  The answer must only be \'Yes\'.  Our government should not have any control of private spending, but the electorate must have total control of government spending via the House of Representatives even with items of insignificant amounts.  Even though this example is related to razor blades which seem insignificant, our government\'s thinking in this regard is they should be spending as little as possible to accomplish a specific purpose and then only when they have determined that the purpose is one that is worthwhile and necessary.  I editted this review only to clarify a point that seemed unclear after I posted it.For those who do not appreciate the social and political commentary, I apologize.    "

With these razors that\'s never been an issue for me.Granted, these are the most expensive razors you\'ll typically see in stores. However, the amazon price is great (especially with subscribe & save). Moreover, using tips I saw on another razor review, I can get an individual Gillette razor to last about a month. By rinsing the gunk off with hot water after shaving, spraying the razor with shower cleaner, then propping it against the wall the durability improves dramatically.Honestly, if I hadn\'t discovered I could make a single razor last a month I wouldn\'t bother buying these. I think they\'re the best, but they\'re not THAT much better than other razors. A dull razor is a dull razor regardless of brand. Yet, if you can make a razor 12 pack last a year, and they\'re so cheap on Amazon, why not buy the best?    "

The last time I was shopping for blades, the ProSkin ones were on sale, so I thought I\'d try them (the ever-rising price on the Venus blades is their downside).The first time I used it, I wound up with about 6 different cuts, several of them bleeding freely.  I chalked it up to the first time.... Next use I still wound up bleeding (though not as badly).  After that I began to use regular shave-gel with the blade (defeating their whole point), and with that I still get razor burn and abrasions, but no bleeding.These blades defeat the very trait I use Venus razors for, and the earlier reviewer is correct-- the \'moisture bars\' fall off after a couple of weeks (maybe 5 or 6 uses in my case), making them no bargain (I can use the regular blades for a month or more each).The DO shave closely and leave skin smooth, but are not worth the trade-off in discomfort and blood.My advice is skip these and get any of the other blades in the line-- I\'ve tried them all at different times and they all work better than the ProSkin ones.

It\'s triple blade design seems like overkill, I mean really, I can get just as close of shaves with a classic DE safety razor, and have less razor burn. If you haven\'t learned already, more blades dragging across the surface of the skin means increased chance for razor burn, it\'s just that simple. So while this razor is less prone to give razor burn than the 4 and 5 blade designs, it\'s still going to be worse than a 2 or single blade design. We\'re talking about human body hair here, we\'re not using it to shave an angora rabbit.The 3 blades are spaced well enough apart that they don\'t easily clog, and rinse very easily. The handle is nicely contoured and easy to hold without slippage at most any angle, and is textured enough not to be slippery when all soapy. Speaking of soapy, those little goo-bars on the razor are awful. They turn to slime, clear slime like when you blow your nose with a bad head-cold. It\'s just stringy and disgusting looking. They also do little to help the blades glide over wet skin. I ended up with the worst razor burn I\'ve ever had by trying to use this razor on wet skin. Once I went back to foaming up my legs with a super-slick tallow shaving soap, I was able to get irritation free shaves.The little goo bars don\'t last past 4 shaves for me before they\'re gone. They don\'t last nearly as long as the blades stay sharp. Cost-wise I\'m not thrilled either, with the price of the cartridge refills.

If you want to use the trimmer to do some edging, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. It\'s not powerful enough to do edging. It works fine trimming with each of the combs, but edging is out. My 20 year old Con-air trimmer does better due to more power (2 AA batteries as opposed to 1 AA battery for the styler). And the replacement cartridges prices are insane, although you can get the 6 cartridge replacement from Amazon for cheaper than you can a 4 cartridge replacement at any store. I suggest buying the fusion proglide razor instead of the 3-in-1 trimmer. Not worth the money for the trimmer    "

It has a nice weight to it -- definitely doesn\'t feel cheap -- and is grippy to hold, though the razor has quite a bit of bulk to it when using the Fusion ProGlide attachment. Not something to stop me from using it, but it\'ll take a little adjustment over the \'finesse\' I had with a regular Fusion handle. The trimmer is really where this thing shines. The Braun-branded trimmer is quite powerful and is perfect for shaping up my facial hair. I use it for sideburns and to keep a unibrow at bay. Gets the job done very nicely. Nothing to plug in, it runs off a single battery and the included stand is very space-saving.If you\'re already a Fusion user, this is a nice upgrade. If not, consider it just for the trimmer. I\'m happy with how much counter space I\'ve reclaimed and that all my face care appliances are now in one convenient package.    "

Unfortunately the competitive price of this product did not make up for the poor quality and unsafety of it. During brushing, small pieces of metal came out of the toothbrush heads and shot into the gums and lips, sometimes causing lacerations. After this, the round brushing part of the head would come loose itself.After 3 of the toothbrush heads did this, I contacted the seller by email and then by phone and explained the problem to them. They apologized and explained that this was a generic product from a chinese manufacturer and although they had never run into this/any problem with their products before, they would send me a replacement (oral B original) product. I agreed.Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, as I began to use these \'original oral B\' toothbrush heads, the same problem has recurred with pieces of metal shooting out of the rotating toothbrush head during brushing and hitting the gums and lips. I\'ve been using oral B electric toothbrushes for a few years and have never seen anything like this. I\'m not exactly sure if this second set I have received are really oral B products or not.My point is that low price apparently means poor quality, at least in the case of this seller."

She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself. I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode."

3322,149,152,20100705,B00006ANDK,2,"July 5, 2010",A3EKC0CWQQRXPJ,Unsanitary!!!,"I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care electric toothbrush set with these Oral-B Sensitive brush heads for over 4yrs now.  I GENERALLY am a review & research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I\'ve read reviews on but I went in for a dental appointment years ago and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding & inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers so I was sold! I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn\'t compare any former experience and simply didn\'t know any better.  I DO have to say that other than my \'unsanitary\' concern about these that I\'ll get to in a moment, it\'s great! I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard, it\'s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine, I have never had any \'break\' or get wobbly on me, there is a color indicator where the blue area on your toothbrush gets lighter over time to let you know when it\'s time to swap out your toothbrush, etc.Let me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it\'s clean & smells good, my home is clean - in fact I\'m actually somewhat of a germaphobe so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  I know it\'s odd to point all that out but I didn\'t want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  :-).No matter WHAT I do...I\'ve tried using bottled water to brush my teeth thinking it\'s our tap water (it\'s not...my kids & hubby don\'t have an issue w/ their toothbrushes); I\'ve tried switching to a different toothsoap / tooth powder / toothpaste - and I STILL have the same issue.  My hubby & dentist have confirmed that I don\'t have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth so it\'s not in my mouth...so I\'m left to think that is DEFINITELY the DESIGN of Oral-B toothbrush replacements heads!!!Humor me for a minute and do a \'zoom\' on the picture of Oral-B replacement toothbrushes in the middle of the toothbrush handle.  There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle while brushing then certainly a mixture of that & water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets in.I DO make a habit of actually removing my brush head in running water and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks & on the bottom where you place the charger) AND on the toothbrush head itself - both on the brush area and on & inside the handle and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide & a clean washcloth (since I didn\'t know where the smell was coming from) AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  It does NOT happen when I take all of these precautions but in my opinion, I shouldn\'t HAVE to do this in order to avoid the musty smell...musty stench means that bacteria is harboring & growing so to stick something filled with germs to \'clean\' with is not the best option in my opinion.FYI: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it\'s not me and sure enough, it\'s not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn\'t have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I\'m currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it\'s a design flaw in the brush design.I\'d rather not have to worry if my toothbrush is growing bacteria or not, I want to simply rinse the brush & handle after each use and store it away like I\'m supposed to be able to do.  I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  I don\'t understand how anyone else hasn\'t complained about this issue - maybe I\'m taking care of them wrong but I\'ve even called the company and it was suggested that maybe it was our water or toothpaste...when I told her that my other family members didn\'t have this issue, she was at a loss.For those who are also looking & comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it\'s more dome shaped so the toothpaste \'gunk\' from brushing & rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the \'dome shape\' vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle & electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B\'s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it\'s hard to get in small areas of your mouth."

I used to buy this type, because this was the only choice that I could find in the retail stores. Usually, \'Dual Clean\' heads also were available, but I do not like them. They are just so big. I wanted to switch to another type, and I did a little research. I found Oral-B \'Sensitive\' heads, and I found good reviews on this product. I am using this heads for a few weeks now. I bought this product because it probably has the highest bristle density, and the bristles are extra soft so they are very gentle on the gum. In my opinion, they do a very good job. I feel that they clean better than \'Precision Clean\' heads. I use HydroFloss after brushing. When I was using \'Precision Clean,\' I used to still see some stuff coming out of the area between my teeth during cleaning with HydroFloss. However, this stopped when I switched to \'Sensitive\' heads. I feel that \'Sensitive\' head is cleaning better. It is also more gentle on my gum."
3324,151,154,20100609,B00006ANDK,4,"June 9, 2010",A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX,"Gentle, but wish it was recyclable, like Preserve","I am a huge fan of powered toothbrushes - my mouth just doesn\'t feel as clean when I use a manual toothbrush. I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that\'s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference! I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads. They feel softer on my gums and so I think they are a gentler choice. I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth. I have been using these heads for almost 10 years and often get compliments at the dentist. Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums. Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best. I\'m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn\'t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth & gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.I do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect. I\'ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months. I find that the blue begins to fade after one month. I think I\'m an average brusher (twice or more daily) and I even have two toothbrushes I switch between (depending on which is charged & what bathroom I\'m in), so I would think that the indicator would last longer.This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE! Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (& recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual. (If you\'re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve. They sell plates, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, razors, etc. & I do really like their razors) I know that plastic recycling isn\'t the best thing for the environment, but it\'s gotta be better than throwing all these heads in the trash/dump/ocean... I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they\'re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.) But, I can only keep so many. Anyway, that\'s why I give this product 4 stars, instead of 5. Gentle, but wish they were recycled & recyclable.Many thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)"

Amazon claims that \'The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\'  But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush. The toothbrush does work, however. I have two identical Oral-B 3D excel toothbrushes purchased on 8/20/01.  To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  I run the battery down to zero on the one I\'m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it\'s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle itself.Some reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that\'s hard to imagine:  there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  It\'s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it. It\'s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better."

Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price. So I asked myself, \'How bad can they be\'?The brush heads I received looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense). When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example. On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth). These brush heads have very poor motion constraint. The circular brush can easily \'slide\' around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).Not only that, but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing. As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \'knock-off\', more interested in looking like the original than acting like it.My advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads. Your mouth and your dentist will thank you."

Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.2.  Waxed floss is \'waxed\' to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don\'t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: \'If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away\'.I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.Jim \'Konedog\' Koenig, DDS"

The fakes are also getting very hard to spot, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page for the \'floss action\' had were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference is in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. I personally wouldn\'t buy from Amazon because it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off may be similar in quality.I bought several different brush heads from Amazon this Christmas, and all appear to be fakes.

The size of the brush head doesn\'t bother me, though it is a little messier to use.  It\'s hard to keep your mouth closed enough to keep all that drool inside.

I liked it so much more than the regular FlexiSoft head that I immediately ordered the 3-pack.The extra bristles with their side-to-side oscillation add more oomph to the Oral B\'s tingle-inducing cleaning action.  I can feel it all the way to the base of each tooth.  When I rinse, I see more loosened debris swirling down the drain.  I finish my morning brushing with a hydrogen peroxide rinse, and, man oh man, does it get foamy, an indication of freshly cleaned dental and gum surfaces.The price is already a bargain but with additional available discounts like Free Super Saver Shipping, it\'s a steal."

At first I was afraid to open the packaging because of all those reports about brush heads having no repacement ring, having an oral-B insignia with a grey background, and made in Germany are counterfiet. But, eventually I opened the package, and nothing is wrong with the brush head. It is Not a Tongue Mutilator, nor does it have out of shape bristels, not is it a counterfeit. All those pieces of information are either false, or just one time bad experiences. My brush head still has its shape maintained, isn\'t too hard and hasn\'t done anything funky. I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time and I just like it. If someone has a smaller than average mouth then, or if you\'re one of those people who was used to small brush heads back in the day (when you used conventional brushes), then this brush head is not for you. Otherwise its a wonderful brush head and it definitely beats the precission brush head by far (I haven\'t used the floss action brush head yet so I dont know if that one is any better)."

I just bought these refills for my oralB electric. I find that it really beats down on my teath and the brush seems very stiff and small. I cant really aim properly because of all the vibration and my gums get sore. i used it once or twice and just cant handle it.I\'ve always used a regular toothbrush and floss and i\'m sticking to that. i have much more control. my hygenist actually asked me if i used an electric because she didnt see much tartar. i\'m doing fine without the electric.

I gave the Floss Action heads a try using the Oral B Vitality motor unit and thought the Floss Action heads weren\'t very good. About a year later, I put the same Floss Action head on an Oral B Smart Series 5000 and it was totally different. I\'d definitely buy the Floss Action heads in the future.The Floss Action heads are similar to the standard Precision heads, but have 4 extra rubber paddles for \'flossing action\'  or removing some stains. With the Vitality brush, the RPMs weren\'t fast enough or the oscillating action was slightly off causing the Floss Action heads to hurt my gums a little. They acted more like bumpers than anything else. With the Oral B 5000, the RPM seemed faster and smoother, and the Floss Action heads felt the same as the Precision heads.I normally floss before brushing, so I cannot comment on whether the Floss Action heads can replace the act of flossing. I still recommend following your hygienist\'s recommendations, which is usually to floss before brushing.It works well at cleaning my teeth, and it is compatible with most Oral B brush motors. However, I recommend you buy an updated unit and not try to use the Floss Action on a Vitality, low-end model, or something made a decade ago. The 4 extra paddles don\'t feel like they\'re doing anything, but I can see them oscillating on my teeth and gums.Overall: 4/5 stars"

I figured that maybe there was just a difference in packaging for online markets. Well I guess that I should have questioned things more because I am convinced that I could not have received authentic OralB Floss Action brush heads. The brush heads I got all broke very soon after beginning to use them. I usually get about three months from each brush head as is indicated on the packaging for the heads. With these here, the brush heads all started coming loose easily move back and forth after only a few weeks. This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing. That was not enjoyable! I would say that these brush heads were either some kind of knock-off, or maybe someone found a way to sell the brush heads that were rejected in production.

Seeing that they were still saying this was for canker sore sufferers I bought several tubes. Almost immediately after I started using this product I had one canker sore after another. I then changed to another SLS free brand and everything has healed up and is back to normal. My thoughts are that either this new product is worthless for preventing canker sores or I got a bad batch that had SLS in it. Attempts to contact the company through the \'contact us\' section of their web site have failed. I guess I\'ll be throwing away several tubes of this not inexpensive toothpaste.1/22 Edit - A few days after posting this review Rembrandt responded to my complaint to them about this product.

The original must have lasted at least 10 years, but the replacement doesn\'t look like it will hold up as well.

If you understand the advantages and disadvantages and know what you\'re getting, this seems a fine reusable filter.  Be advised that if you have a Braun coffee maker you might need the Braun brand replacement filter as some off-brand replacement filters don\'t have the \'notches\' in the rim of the filter that you would need to fit some Braun coffee makers.The description of the product on the Amazon page that I ordered the filter from is wrong.

Again - Amazon kicks everyone else\'s butt on pricing.  I highly recommend this toothbrush and replacement heads - it (in my opinion) is far superior in styling & price point to the other manufacturers\' out there!!

The odd number of three Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush Heads and one useless precision head is inconvenient for two people.

Once I was finally able to contact them, the seller fixed the problem in a timely manner going out of their way to make sure that everything was done correctly.  The brushes arrived in perfect shape much more quickly than expected.  I would buy from this seller again and give them 5 stars.Dec update: I wish this came in an actual 4 pack. I can\'t use the one that is supposed to clean between your teeth as I don\'t have that much space between my teeth so that one is wasted on me. I\'d rather they had a pack of brushes and a pack of those so that we could purchase only what we actually need.  The brushes however, while harder than I am used to are color coded so that the head can be switched for multiple people to use.  The thing to remember about brushing with these is what I keep in my head every single time, let the brush do the work, otherwise you will be brushing too hard and hurt the enamel on your teeth.  What I really wish is, that I could use the oral b sonic complete brushes with this brush handle, I don\'t understand why they make different brush heads for each of their sonic toothbrushes or barring that, they would actually be consistent in their brusheads, these really should be softer."

Once we completed the purchase and went to fill out the form, we then discovered that the rebate was only applicable to one toothbrush, despite our purchasing two on the same order. After calling the customer service number, we were told we are S.O.L. on getting the rebate for both, and there is no way to \'contact the seller\' about this.Thus we have taken to the always useful Comments section to air our grievance; We are Prime members, buy a lot of products on Amazon, and feel like Amazon should definitely do better.The toothbrushes do work great though, and despite our now degraded opinion of Amazon rebates etc, we are happy with the product so far."

The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.  I bought this second one in 9/2010 while Amazon & OralB had a 50% off rebate so ended up paying only $25 for it - a definite buy at that price!

Oral B did a pretty good job of ripping off the Sonicare technology.  What  I did not like is that the Oral B didn\'t shut off automatically after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, plus the shutoff button accumulates toothpaste runoff in the process, which can be kind off gross to turn off.  Maybe it is the shape of the Oral B brush, but it sometimes felt like it missed those hard to reach places too.  Still a decent product with a decent price.

After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.-----THE GIST OF IT---------I\'m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that\'s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn\'t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It\'s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn\'t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn\'t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It\'s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.-----ENDING------Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won\'t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won\'t do it.  They\'ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.Lastly, I don\'t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes."

Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use. Why the three stars and not just one? It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip brush.I have both a Oral-B Triumph and a Sonicare (can\'t remember the model number), and find both to be excellent performers. They are different, and each has its strengths/weaknesses, so I alternate between the two. The one shortcoming neither address well is getting between teeth to get out tea and coffee stains (and the occasional cigarette). For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside. My 6-month dental cleaning/checkup gets rid of them, but by month 4 or 5, they\'re back.Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it\'s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains. The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great. After brushing with either the Triumph or Sonicare, I finish with a 30-60 second run using the Precision Tip. Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth using.For everything else, the Pulsonic is a so-so performer at best. Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I\'ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.If you\'re looking to stop or get rid of in-between teeth stains, get this model and use it in combination with another model. If in-between teeth stains are not an issue, don\'t even bother with this. Pick up a different Oral-B or a Sonicare -- you\'ll be a lot happier with it than the Pulsonic."

Since I began using this toothbrush my teeth have never felt cleaner.  It is used just like a manual toothbrush, but it cleans teeth much better.  The price was reasonable too and Oral-B was offering a $15.00 rebate when I purchased it so that made the deal even sweeter.  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who likes to brush his or her teeth the old fashioned way but with a serious power boost.  I have very sensitive gums and teeth and the sensitive setting is perfect...there is little to no irritation.

It was time to replace it because it wasn\'t holding a charge for very long. I decided to try this cheaper version and I am not sorry. It does the same job as the more expensive version and is easier to hold. It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it. Because it is lighter and thinner, I think I actually use it longer. It is also easier to find the replacement heads for it. I also think that the shape of the toothbrush makes it is easier to get at the back of the bottom teeth where the plaque is the worst. That means less time in the hygenist chair. Since using the sonic toothbrush I definitely see a decrease in the build up of plaque and that is makes this purchase worth every cent."

It\'s an electric toothbrush that\'s about the same size a conventional toothbrush!And it does a good job of cleaning my teeth. I\'ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I\'m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance. It\'s a mighty little toothbrush.The one and only drawback I\'ve found -- and it\'s a small one --  is that unlike the Sonicare the Pulsonic doesn\'t have a 2 minute timer. Instead it has a 30 second timer.  You have to count to four without electronic assistance (Four 30-sec treatments equal 2 minutes which is my Dentist\'s recommended brushing time.)Also as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars. Most toothbrushes -- both electric and non-electric -- fail this test. So that\'s another big plus.So in a nutshell, if you\'re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel), small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all."

And I have had problems knowing when it needs to be recharged, as electrical outlets in my bathroom are in high demand, and there\'s no way of knowing when you\'re about to run out of juice.That said, the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great deal more efficient than the old \'analog\' toothbrushes most of us grew up with.  It does a better job of hitting hard-to-reach areas than I do in the morning (!) and my whole mouth feels pretty invigorated after using it.The main concern consumers should have is the value for money one.  This is a pretty great deal when more powerful tooth-cleaning systems can cost more than $200.  You lose a little power by buying this item, which says for $33 or so.

Wish I had read more reviews before buying two! This happened to me and my husband when he tried his...it is really easy to twist ever so slightly while brushing which pops head off. It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on. Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth. Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode. Returning two of these and will probably go back to Sonicare for next purchase."

I didn\'t weigh them, but the Pulsonic is definitely lighter than my Sonicare brush. I also appreciate the fact that the Pulsonic comes with an extra brush head for deep cleaning, along with the standard charger. The basic brush head\'s shape does more for me than the Sonicare\'s as well.The Bad: Unfortunately, I just never felt like the Pulsonic was vibrating/cleaning as hard as my Sonicare. Instead of holding it in place and letting the brush do the work, the Pulsonic requires a fair amount of manual manipulation, during which the brush head can disengage from the main unit.The Verdict: It\'s slicker and cheaper than the competition, but in this case I think you\'re better off spending your money on the deeper cleaning, more reliable Sonicare line."

The first time I have tried it, it felt a bit unpleasant, but I have gotten used to it very quickly. The best thing about this brush is the bigger brush head as compared to Oral-B Triumph. The brush allows you to use twice as much toothpaste (I have always been concerned that I was not using enough toothpaste with round Oral-B brushes), and it seems that it cleans teeth faster on flat surfaces. Getting into corners requires as much effort as with any other toothbrush.What I did not like: the charger is big and you cannot remove extra brush holders; to turn it off you have to push the power button twice (the first time it switches to sensitive mode); you are supposed to use it in a circular motion, and I tend not to be very good at it. In old days I had problems with traditional toothbrushes as I used to move them up and down and ended up scratching my teeth, so I am afraid this might happen with this brush as well. Finally, the description promises whiter teeth in two weeks, but I cannot see any difference."

Kind of like the old vibrating toothbrushes from long ago, except the power behind this is far greater, and much more effective.Sonicare had the benefit of being first with this type of brush, but Oral-B has an advantage in that they can study the other product and make improvements on it.  I\'d say the major difference is that the Oral-B is thinner, lighter, and therefore easier to hold and maneuver around the mouth.  The replacement brushes are also less expensive on this model, which is important as they can really add up if you replace them as recommended by the manufacturer, every three months or so.I was pleased to see that toothpaste can be used with it, although if you use too much you\'ll be foaming at the mouth from the ultrasonics.  It is still pretty foamy, so I recommend staying close to the sink.The recharging base is small, attractive, and wall-mountable.  The power cord plugs into a wall outlet and doesn\'t use a transformer, so it won\'t take up additional outlets. It will hold two spare brush heads behind the toothbrush, and allows the toothbrush to be dropped in facing any direction.  So, when you are done it is an easy matter to drop the toothbrush back onto its base.It actually worked quite a bit better than I expected.  The head is fairly small, so it is easy to move around your mouth to clean each tooth.  The timer lets you know if you are rushing the job (I usually am, but at least now I can\'t pretend I don\'t know that!).  The massage mode for the brush seems like a feature that I\'ll never use, but people with tender gums that are working their way up to the full speed might like it.  I use mine on clean mode all the time and it works well.  It is somewhat annoying that both modes are accessible through the single button given that I never use the lower-speed.  It isn\'t so annoying that it is a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.I was happy with the noise level, too.  Nothing bugs me more than holding something that sounds like a buzz saw so close to my ear in the morning.  Mercifully, this brush is pretty quiet, as these things go.  It is louder than a manual brush, of course, but quieter than an electric shaver.  The pitch is a little high, but nothing I can\'t live with.Overall, I like it and would get it again.

Much better than Crest Spinbrush. I am very happy to have it.- It takes 2 AA rechargeable batteries. A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks. (it depends on how long your batteries hold the charge). Alkaline batteries last a month. So it is very useful for traveling.- Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken. Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.- If you want to save the environment and you don\'t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans then you don\'t like toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries. It is very hard to remove the batteries from the unit to handle them properly.- This is the least expensive electric toothbrush from Oral-B. But it performs really well.- This toothbrush uses the same refill brushes that other expensive models use. So you get similar result for much less money.Con:- This one does not have a timer. You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.- People reported that this toothbrush lasts from 1 to 2 years. Well, the most expensive (about 9 times more expensive) Oral-B electric toothbrush lasts from 3 to 5 years. If you do not care about other features the expensive ones offers, I think this has more value."

I thought of using my teeth as gripper, but doubted that would be good for my dental health.  I finally pried the end off with the back of a fine-bladed knife.  The interior was not marked with the customary + or - signs for the battery placement.  It appeared that the wire springs were at one end, so I inserted batteries side-by-side pointed together.  Again, Bad move!  After replacing the end piece with difficulty, of course the appliance would not turn on.  Then I found a one sentence instruction of how to place the batteries -- on a corner of cardboard inner packaging.  Well done, Oral-B -- you hid that quite successfully!

I am able to eat with relative abandon again (after getting braces) once I learned how to use the SmartSeries 5000 properly and in a systematic way.The SmartSeries 5000 (with an ortho brush head and power tip attachment) has made brushing and cleaning with braces on extremely easy and a no-brainer.The kit includes a handy travel case (with holders for two attachments), lightweight charger, and timer which links wirelessly to the toothbrush.I usually start with the power tip which is very effective in cleaning debris around brackets and between the wires.  To clean with the ortho brush head, simply press it in front of each tooth and count slowly to twelve -- going from the rear molars to the front teeth on each side on both top and bottom rows of teeth. After that, just brush the biting surfaces and rear of the teeth.Overall, the kit components were very useful to me except for the timer.The timer would display a ring which represented the top and bottom rows of teeth.  The ring was split into four sections and the timer would indicate the amount of time needed for each quadrant of teeth.  It was somewhat tricky to clean by the quadrant and just easier for me to use a fixed count for each tooth."

I originally had planned on purchasing a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush but after reading many different reviews, decided on the Oral-B instead.  The clock/timer is a nice feature, makes me more aware of how much time I spend on different sections of teeth.  The motor hesitates when too much pressure is applied which is also a plus for me as I have a tendency to press too hard.  I\'ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don\'t use the stand that it came with but it\'s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn\'t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I\'ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.

My old one was getting long in the tooth(sorry about pun!) and running real slow, so I investigated buying a new one.  Since they were on a 50% rebate sale, i just bought the top of the line 5000 unit.  I could not be more pleased with how clean my teeth end up - I have never had a brush that cleans as well as this one; my hygienist will be so pleased!I would like to expound on the advantages of this unit over the 4000 or 3000 in cleaning ability, but I have no idea, not having used the others.  If the only difference is gimmicks, then this unit is certainly full of them, and you might be just as pleased with a cheaper unit without the unnecessary gimmicks and modes.One big con: there is a mode button to toggle through the 5 different modes that are built into this unit.  Most people, like me, will probably only use one mode, or at least will predominately use one mode.  The mode button is VERY poorly placed, in a very key position.  It is impossible to use this unit without accidentally hitting the mode key on a regular basis, if not every day.  Very annoying to have to figure out how to get back to your preferred mode.  They could not have chosen a poorer location for this if that was the goal.  Its like accidentally hitting the caps lock key on a laptop, for those who do not look at the screen while we type. What were they thinking, if they were thinking at all?  I like good design.  All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an \'F\' for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO. It was just too big a mistake to be an oversight. A smaller con - the outlet plug is a huge unit that sticks straight out from the wall - takes up space and looks stupid - should have been flush.Yet overall, I gave this 4 stars for the great cleaning and the rest of the design and charger."

It takes a few days to get used to not using the same rigorous back and forth brushing action, but you get used to it. The secret is in the reciprocating action that allows the brush to get between teeth in ways a normal brush cannot. It also cleans those tough back molars extremely well. The included charger is also 110-220v which is a nice feature for someone who travels a lot and lives in Europe like myself. I was also a little apprehensive about the wireless timer/clock, but after using it for awhile it makes a lot of sense and I like using it. I wish they would include an alarm clock or multiple timezones in future iterations to make it more travel friendly and usable. If there were any downside to this toothbrush it would be in it\'s travel \'footprint\'. Although the case is very nice and holds the brush and two heads, its much larger than a regular brush and will take up more space while traveling. The additional wireless timer adds additional packing requirements (which is why I recommend that they add some more features to the clock to make it more usable and travel friendly). If you don\'t travel much, then the size will be fine for your bathroom and the included stand is nice, functional, and compact. Overall, I strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to bring their oral hygiene to the next level. It\'s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but I guarantee your teeth will feel considerably cleaner and look whiter after using it for only a week or two. Great product!"

After about 2 weeks, the battery display started to develop moisture within the display. At around one month, the display could no longer be seen since condensation had turned into large water globules that obstructed the display.With 4 uses per day by two adults, after 3.5 months, the toothbrush failed to turn on but would activate after a few minutes or sometime in the day by itself. It is apparent that the board has gone bad and the toothbrush is no longer useable reliably.Pros:This toothbrush has a holding stand that can hold up to four individual heads for multiple users, or different toothbrush heads. (Be sure to dry your toothbrush head before placing in case, or you will have a gradual soap scum build up)Multiple Settings for persons with sensitive teeth.Timer that displays vibrations by 30 second intervals for dentistry recommended minimum of 30 seconds per quadrant.Timer also displays time. (Would like to have had the timer lit since the angle is almost at 90 degrees and should be angled slightly higher by about 15 degrees more for adult use.)Cons:The price is high for what seems to be only a timer radio frequency linked display and a few lower setting for strength of brushDid not last long for something that is exposed to soap in mouth and running water when rinsedPower connection is very l;arge and takes up a lot of spaceaway from the electrical socket. (MOst people are limited to counter space in the bathroom)In conclusion, I liked the design and feel of the toothbrush but was very dissapointed that it broke on me after only a few months. A little red light displays on the timer to show if you are being to rough on your tooth enamel when brushing, which I liked but also wanted the motor to be as powerful as previous models. Maybe this was bad for my teeth, but I could feel the difference on the gum lining of each tooth when touching sliding my tongue for cleanliness.since some people have a hard time returning things, maybe this one should be bought in a store with a guaranty instead of online. I will try to contact Oral B and Amazon about a replacement, and will update this review upon their response with difficulty or ease."

The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare\'s."

It comes with an adhesive backer so you can stick it to your mirror (or wherever you brush your chompers). I used be the person who brushed for maybe 30 seconds. But with the timer, you can\'t help but feel like crap for quitting early. It tells you how long you\'ve been brushing, the battery level, if you\'re brushing too hard, which zone you should be brushing, and what mode you\'re in. AWESOME! The battery lasts for about a week, but if you\'re on a longer trip you can take the charge out of the base (it\'s tiny) and pack it with you. There are tons of different brush heads and different brush modes, depending on what you\'re trying to accomplish. I got this toothbrush last September and have had two dentist cleanings since then.

It promotes positive teeth brushing and even gives you a smiley face after you are done for a job well done. After awhile my teeth feel cleaner and breathe is fresher. I like how it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me to brush my teeth and the travel case is a nice addition too. If you are looking for a toothbrush then look no further this is the one for you.My only grip is how expensive the brushes are I always try and look for specials or deals so I don\'t end up spending to much per a brush head. I also feel the battery life on mine doesn\'t last as long as I would like it to. I think on a full charge the battery light would flash after a week and a half which i feel is a little to short but its not a big deal. Get this toothbrush.
5306,2133,2183,20110318,B002HWS9GG,5,"March 18, 2011",AW7BGAR3VSIY5,Great Toothbrush,"I bought the Oral-B 5000 brush after doing extensive research. This was my first electric or powered toothbrush. I will not compare it with Philips Sonicare as both are excellent brushes. I went with oral-b as I prefer a rotatory brush over a one that just moves up and down. If like me you are new to electric toothbrush and are wondering if it will be too harsh on your teeth and gums, then I can assure you that I found this oral-b 5000 very gentle. If fact, I would have preferred if it had a little bit more power. I have healthy teeth and gums so for someone who has very sensitive teeth this might be an issue. This brush however has a sensitive mode which reduces the power considerably so you can still go with it.The oral-b 5000 box came with a brush handle (oral-b trimph), 2 brush heads (1 flossaction. 1 prowhite), a smart guide, traveling case, a charging station (charging ring + brushhead storage stand) and a smart plug. An important note: only the oral-b 5000 and 4000 series come with a smart plug (100-240 V) adapter. Others 3000 and lower versions just work for US voltage only and you will need to buy a voltage converter if you want to travel with it. You can tell by looking at the pictures on the outside of the box. Smart plug is bigger as it has voltage conversion circuitry inside it, the other one is just an electric plug. Since I travel frequently, so this was very important to me and thus my choice was limited to 4000 or 5000 series only.Difference between the 4000 and 5000 is that 5000 has a smart guide and the charging station that has a place to store 4 extra brush heads, plus 5000 has one extra mode of operation. Other than that both are identical. The smart guide is not essential for brushing. It just shows you various information like the brushing mode you are using, total brush time, low battery indicator, over pressure warning. It also similes and winks at you! I find it convenient as all the information is in front of me, and if I wanted to change my brushing mode, I do not need to take the toothbrush out of my mouth. The toothbrush always starts in the daily clean mode and you cannot turn it on outside your mouth, as it then sprays toothpaste all over the counter and sink, so if it was not for the smart guide, you will find it very difficult to select the desired brushing mode on the toothbrush.The brush handle and brush heads are made in Germany. They appear well-constructed. The brush handle is water proof and factory sealed against moisture. This is very important as otherwise the moisture will ruin the battery and the circuitry inside, a common problem with electric brushes powered with replaceable AA batteries. The toothbrush is charged through magnetic induction, so it is safe to put the charging station on the bathroom counter, near water. Brush heads are easy to clean and replace. In fact, more than 1 person can use the brush handle, as the only thing that goes into the mouth is the brush head and each person can use their own brush head. The brush heads come with their own colored rings, so you cannot mix your brush head with someone else. The battery life is good and with my typical brushing time of 4-5 minutes twice a day, it lasts for 4-5 days.Finally, about the price. I got the 50% off offer, so the 5000 ended up costing me about $65. It was an excellent deal for me. Is this brush worth $159? Well, I would have to say no. If you can get it for below $100 then it is an excellent deal. Is it better than a manual toothbrush? I would have to say yes! It is 200% better than a manual toothbrush. In fact, after using this you will wonder why you did not switch before.Now, if the brush handle lasts for 3 years and each brush head lasts for at least 5 months, then I will be satisfied with my $65 down payment on this toothbrush.I hope my review was useful. I have tried to concentrate on information I did not find in other reviews. If anyone needs additional information just write a comment on this review and I will respond."

This not only monitors how long you are cleaning, but, has a little red light that is illuminated when you are brushing too hard. What\'s more, once you have reached the two minute mark, a smiley face appears on the digital timer. So helpful! I look forward to following up with my dentist in six months, to track my progress.

Wasn\'t the LCD display on the brush itself good enough? The wireless display is a joke in my opinion considering it is not even back-lit. Secondly, the battery is HORRIBLE for this brush. It takes minimum 14-16 hours to re-charge it and it doesn\'t even last for more than 3 days. I had a sonicare toothbrush before and battery lasted for 15 days and got charged within 6 hours. The dual-action head is so BIG that a normal person can\'t even fit the brush in his mouth. I would expect lot more things if I am paying this much for just a toothbrush."

After reading a bunch of online reviews, I settled on the Braun/Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 brush and some extra replacement heads. Upon receiving the toothbrush, I was a little surprised at how large the handle is, but the brush heads are small enough to move around and focus on one tooth at a time, which is awesome. The polishing head is amazing, with the right toothpaste it feels like a dentist\'s cleaning! The flossing head seems to do its job, the long rubber flappers seem to reach further into the crevices between my teeth than an average toothbrush, although it is no substitute for actually flossing. Within the first couple days of owning this toothbrush I can already notice a difference in  my teeth, they feel amazingly clean and already look a touch whiter. The stand-alone display screen is kind of goofy, but I stuck it on my bathroom mirror and don\'t mind it, it\'s always nice to have a bathroom clock.I Highly recommend this toothbrush, those $10 electric brushes don\'t even compare!"

This brush is simply light-years beyond the old Oral B 3D! It seems more powerful and even more effective (another plus: this model can use the same brushes [Oral B Precision Clean] as my older model, so leftovers won\'t go to waste. This model also accepts other more specialized Oral B brushes).Many thanks to B. Johnson for pointing out the value of the SmartGuide. For me as well, it serves as a neat little bathroom clock. But the most surprising thing is that by breaking down the recommended two-minute brushing cycle into four groups of 30 seconds each (via a simple but effective circular visual cue), the SmartGuide makes the entire process seem to go by faster. (With old-style brushes, the usual two minutes of unstructured brushing casts you upon a veritable ocean of time. I was always surprised by how long it took for the brush to stutter its two-minute signal. Oftentimes, I just stopped when I felt like it!) You always know (1) exactly where you are in the cycle and (2) when to move on to the next quadrant. This unwittingly clever bit of psychology gives you a sense of making clearly defined progress and ensures that you\'re devoting equal time to all sectors of your mouth. I brush for the full two minutes now, with no sense of impatience. In fact, the experience is so pleasant that I almost always do a final general sweep for another 30 seconds or so.One more interesting detail: perhaps because of its higher speed, this brush seems to prevent water and toothpaste from dripping along the brush shaft. I used to have to put my chin up to minimize this minor annoyance with the old Braun. But after several weeks of using the 5000 (with chin still up but not so extremely), I\'ve not had a single drip.I\'ve always been a faithful tooth-brusher, but ever since I got my first electric brush, brushing has been so much fun that I look forward to it. This terrific toothbrush takes the experience to a whole new level. And most important of all, it cleans and stimulates better than anything else I\'ve ever used."

But, according to my hygienist, I am a plaque producing maniac so it was suggested to me by her that I get one of these things.  The initial price shocked me but with the rebate, I could swallow spending a net of $50 on a toothbrush.  So far, I like it.  Not sure why anyone would \'need\' the little timer/clock thing that comes with it and I wouldn\'t suggest anyone spend extra money to have this feature. I have banished mine to a drawer as I do not have unlimited space in my bathroom. The toothbrush itself is a little bulky, but after a week or so, you get used to it. One of the features I do really love is the vibrate indicator.  After 30 seconds, it vibrates to tell you to move on to the next quadrant in your mouth.  What I am astounded by however (and kicking myself in the butt over) is the price of replacement heads.  I never thought to check on that before I bought this.  It costs about $25 for a 3 pack or about $12 for a single.  Also, I have yet to find a 3 pack that is a multi pack (i.e. different heads).  So, if you are like me, and use both the polishing and cleaning head, just using this toothbrush will cost about $9 every month to replace the heads.  As for how well it cleans...I am a smoker and a coffee drinker. I am also obsessed with clean teeth so I get mine cleaned by my hygienist every 3 months.  My teeth feel cleaner since using this toothbrush and if this toothbrush allows me to expand my dentist visits to every 6 months, the cost of the unit and replacement heads will be worth every penny (as I have to pay out of pocket for 2 cleanings a year b/c insurance only covers a cleaning every 6 months)If not, then I will be happy feeling as though I have cleaner teeth but will check this purchase off as a luxury and a \'want\', not a need. One other thing that I would like to point out is that, if, like me, you have limited bathroom space and outlets, this toothbrush is wonderful b/c you only have to charge it once a week. I was very concerned over where this unit was going to \'live\' as I need my bathroom plugs for my hairdryer and flat iron.  I do not leave the base sitting out and I do not constantly charge it. I keep the toothbrush in a drawer in the case (which is very nice) it comes with and simply charge it overnight every sunday."

All I used was the floss action brush head.After using the Oral B continually for about 3 months, I can say that the (oral B) delivers a much more powerful clean. Though the Sonicare was easier to reach the back teeth.  Both delivers a clean, smooth just left the dentist feeling.This thing is way thicker then my old Sonicare E series handle, the pictures on amazon don\'t show the side shots.  And compared to the latest and greatest sonicare, it\'s probably double the thickness.  Go to your local retail store to compare, if thin is in for you.The smartguide clock thing is pretty heavy and thick as well, keep that in mind if you want to find some way of wall mounting it.  If you have it free standing on your sink its hard to read unless your eye level (I\'m 6 3) or stand back a foot or two.  And , although some of the back is rubberized, it won\'t lean against your wall without falling.  I use fun tack to overcome this.  It comes with two sets of AA batteries, which was pretty worrysome to me because most companies don\'t even give one set but it is still going strong.  It\'s neat to know how far in you\'ve brushed and when to switch quadrants, and the \'studder\' helps better then the audible sound the sonicare makes. Smartguide will count up and down for you.Brush heads seems much cheaper then my sonicare.  A 6 pack in my local warehouse club costs $30.  About $15 for a 3 pk on Amazon, and even cheaper with subscribe and save.It charges a bit quicker then my sonicare.  The charger base is really tiny, takes up very little room.  It even snaps into the included 4 user toothbrush tray.  However, even when it\'s done charging the wall wart (power brick thing) stays slightly warm (warmth=energy consumption), so I\'d advise you to unplug after charging.."

It took nearly 24 hours before the green charge lights quit blinking. They stop when the charge is complete. I\'m very happy with how clean my teeth seem after my first brushing session. The sealed box came with one FlossAction brush head.The handle I received says, \'TRIUMPH Professional Care\' and has the green charge lights on a gray background. It is NOT the digital display. My first guess is that this is the older model but some reviewers said they called Oral-B and were told the handles with a non-digital display (like mine) are the newest model, so I\'m not sure. I\'m also not sure if there are any improvements with a newer model - other than the display - that would make me want to be sure and have the newer model? I noticed that Amazon sales of the 4000 model are temporarily on hold while they investigate what appears to be the same issue.For now, I am happy and content with what I have. If anyone knows or learns more about this issue please let us know! The toothbrush seems excellent!Update: After reading through the model 5000 reviews going back to 2009, I now think that mine is a newer model afterall. Originally, they came with a 110/220 volt power adapter with the electronics built into the AC plug which made the plug that goes into the AC outlet overly large (some reviewers complained about the large plug). Mine has just a small basic 2-prong AC plug. Mine is 110 volt only and the electronics are in the charging base where the brush handle sits. Older units came with 2 or 3 brush heads. Mine came with only 1. So, it appears that Oral-B decided to cut some costs by removing the dual voltage and 1 or 2 extra brush heads. They also decided to change the LCD handle display to LED. Hopefully, they also added some improvements?! I\'m still happy."

Crappy Amazon Customer Service,"NOTE: The product is actually 5 stars but I\'m giving this review 1 star for Customer Service. I figured if it was 1 star... perhaps, Amazon checks the reviews and will read this! HUMPH!Regarding the product, 5 STARSI\'ve used the Sonicare E Series for years (probably almost a decade by now). I somehow managed to get periodontal gum disease about 3 years ago. My dentist found no physical cause for this (as I\'m young, do take care of my teeth and gums, and my medical exams/blood tests have all turned up fine). Anyways, after brushing my teeth with the Sonicare, I usually still see visible plague (sticky white residue) on some of my teeth/gums... no matter how much I aim the toothbrush at my gums, etc. Also, since my mouth is small, I always feel that the toothbrush doesn\'t really get the back of my four top front teeth (central & lateral incisors), due to the shape of the toothbrush. My hygienist has always favored Oral B for its smaller shape but I always thought Sonicare was the best that was out there. Anyways, I decided to switch over since our Sonicare was dying and Oral B had a 50% off promotional rebate. Sweet deal!!! After the very first use of this Oral B toothbrush, I didn\'t see any visible plaque! My next dentist appt. is in Feb., so I\'m extremely curious to see if my dentist and hygienist notices any improvements!Regarding Amazon\'s Customer Service, 1 STAR and that star is for the CS Agent #4 that assisted me (He/she really gets 5 stars... all other CS Agents get 0 stars!)So, Oral B\'s website clearly stated that the 50% off promotional rebate was valid for purchases from Sept. 1st through Nov. 30th. It also stated: \'participating online retailers will provide a printable rebate form with purchase\' and listed Amazon as a participating online retailer. However, the \'rebate forms for recent purchases\' link (at the top of Amazon\'s product description) provided us with a PDF link to an older rebate (valid for purchases by Oct. 31st). Also, when we clicked on the \'instructions\' link and followed the steps to see if any of our purchases qualified for a rebate, it came back saying that our Oral B purchase didn\'t qualify for any rebates. (We decided to go this route before contacting CS in the hopes that we could obtain the correct rebate through a different method on Amazon\'s website.)So, I contacted Amazon\'s CS via chat, tell them my problem, provided the links to Amazon\'s product page and Oral B\'s product page (for their reference) and requested that they send me the new and/or correct rebate form. Here goes my frustration:- CS Agent #1: Reads my message, puts me on hold to research, comes back and tells me that my problem is that the rebate was for purchases made by Oct. 31st and I didn\'t qualify since I purchased the product in Nov. DUH! I KNOW THAT! I proceed to resend him the link to Oral B\'s site that clearly stated the new promotion and that Amazon was a participating online retailer. CS Agent #1 tells me \'We support a wide range of mail-in offers, but this particular offer is a transaction between you and the manufacturer. If you need more help with the offer, I recommend contacting Oral B directly.\' Great. Useless. I asked for a phone number so that I could speak with someone and was provided with an Amazon CS phone number.- Called and spoke with CS Agent #2: Explained my problem, stated that CS Agent #1 was not helpful and if he could please assist. I also explained that CS Agent #1 was not aware of the new promotion, etc. etc. I was again placed on hold while he researched the issue and he also came back with the same line, \'that I purchased the product outside of the promotional offer.\' CS Agent #2 did not have internet access so I requested that he transfer me to a manager that had internet access and could see what Oral B\'s site stated.- Transferred to CS Agent #3 (who was a regional manager): He said that he was sorry that Amazon\'s website stated one thing while Oral B\'s site stated another. He can only submit my request to Amazon\'s marketing team and that they should hopefully send me the correct rebate on Monday (as I had called on a Sunday and Marketing was closed).During all this time (that I was on the phone), I was again on Amazon chat with yet another CS Agent... I figured... I must somehow be able to reach someone that understands and can assist!- CS Agent #4: I explained that I had already spoken to several people, explained my situation and asked that he/she kindly please research the links that I\'m sending before he/she comes back to tell me that I purchased outside of the qualifying promotional period. CS Agent #4 comes back and saves the day! Apparently, if you scroll further down the product page on Amazon, under \'Special Offers & Product Promotions\', is yet another rebate link... this time to the CORRECT FREAKING REBATE! YES! YES! YES! I was so thrilled that I thanked CS Agent #4 profusely. I also asked CS Agent #4 to tell the Amazon web team that the link at the top of the page refers to the old rebate, which is confusing when there\'s another link further down that refers to the new rebate.So, yes, I missed the second rebate link on the product page... but so did the first 3 Amazon CS reps! It took 4 tries to get someone competent to assist me.I also think it\'s pretty incompetent of Amazon\'s web team to 1) Not have the two rebates listed together under the same section... why have multiple rebates available on different parts of the page? And 2) when checking to see if your purchase qualified for any rebates (although a cool feature) was definitely useless in my case as it didn\'t register the fact that the Oral B toothbrush did indeed qualify for a rebate (that was apparently available after all on their website)!Phooey on Amazon for their customer service and web team.Other than this frustrating experience, I do enjoy shopping on Amazon.com... I guess it is safe and hassle free... as long as you don\'t require a rebate or customer service!"

I used to use the Sonicare Elite 9500.3. I just opened the package yesterday evening and have used it twice so far.4. I needed a new brush because my old brush\'s battery died.*Brushing*Pros1. I am happy with the cleaning that I am getting.2. The brush feels like it is massaging my gums.*Charging*Pros1. This brush is dual voltage and will work both in 110v and 220v areas.2. This base of the brush seems much more stable than my  Sonicare since it is a little wider.*Traveling*Pros1. The brush does include a travel case.2. Since the travel case is plastic, it will be much easier to clean though compared to the cloth Sonicare case I had.Cons1. The travel case is MUCH larger than my old Sonicare.2. The travel case appears that it is more likely to break since the plastic hinge area seems like it can wear down.3. The brush heads do not have a plastic cap to help protect the bristles.  I liked that the Sonicare had this option since I was reassured that nothing dirty was touching the bristles while transporting it.*Operation*Cons1. I could not figure out how to get the brush to offer an audible cue when switching quadrants while connected to the SmartGuide.  It only offers an audible cue when the radio is turned off.*Cost*Pros1. This brush is much cheaper than the latest Sonicare.2. Replacement brush heads are much cheaper than the Sonicare (by about half the price).*Maintenance*Pros1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush heads appears that it will be much easier to clean unlike my Sonicare which always had a lot of buildup that was difficult to clean.Cons1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush head is a relatively small metal rod.  I am concerned that if I drop the toothbrush, this may bend and I would be unable to load any brush heads.2. On either side of the brush, there is a section with a silver coating.  Unfortunately, this stains easily with water stains.  I wish that Oral-B had used something that would help avoid the water stains.Overall, I am content with the brush. I wouldn\'t consider myself a Sonicare convert since this isn\'t perfect either, but I plan on keeping this brush."

I also like the different modes that it offers. Honestly, I use the main one the most, but the gum massaging one is a nice one that I use occasionally. The SmartGuide, although not a must-have, is very nice to help you see how long you\'ve been brushing and what section of your mouth you are supposed to be on. My husband also got the same brush, just not with the SmartGuide. He doesn\'t mind that he doesn\'t have one (the Oral-B rep told us over the phone that the model just below this one would still be compatible with the SmartGuide but it isn\'t) but admits that it would be nice. My mouth feels so nice after I brush. I actually used a regular toothbrush the other day after using my Oral-B for a few weeks because I just needed to brush for 30 seconds and run. It felt so...crappy! I was shocked how useless the brush felt in my mouth, like it was doing nothing. Anyway, needless to say, I\'ll never go back to a regular brush."

I bought the toothbrush for my husband as a gift since his dental hygienist had recommended he use one and suggested the Oral-B (he drinks a lot of coffee).  I also bought another Oral-B Professional Care model for myself but without the clock or toothbrush holder as I didn\'t have the room on the shelf where I keep the electric toothbrush in another bathroom, and am just as pleased with it.  However, had I bought the same model, I read in the directions that there was a step necessary so one unit would not interfere with the other if they were too close to each other.  I\'m contemplating buying a third electric toothbrush to keep in my second home (my husband will probably take his with him, but mine doesn\'t have a traveling case, and with all I take back and forth, it\'s just as easy to keep one in each place).  I will add that I like the Oral-B better than the Sonicare I use there.

As I could not find more details from other reviews (maybe I missed) based on how I plan to use it. I\'ll focus the review on that front. I thought the SmartGuide is very helpful as the kids can clearly see the progress and stay on the brushing until 2 min. is reached. I\'m glad to report that it works as planned perfectly. As an adult, it is easier to manage the discipline on how long you should brush your teeth. However, my kids constantly want to get off the process and it is painful to calm them down and persuade them to go further. With the SmartGuide clearly showing the progress and how far you are away from the \'smiling face\', it helps managing the expectation excellently.Now get the details on how the SmartGuide works for our use. Each 5000 comes with one SmartGuide, and you can use just one for more than one toothbrushes. However, the manual also provides you instructions on how to make each SmartBuide dedicate to individual toothbrush if it is what you desired. I bought two together, and found that both SmartGuide will respond to signal coming from each toothbrush as the way I received them. Since I don\'t want to put two SmartGuides in one bathroom, I don\'t need to reconfigure anything.The SmartGuide function is very simple. It automatically receive the signal from the 5000 toothbrush as you start brushing. If you stop in the middle, the time counting will pause then resume when you continue. If you wait longer, (not sure exact, maybe 30 sec or longer), it will reset itself. Everything is automatic, there is no manual button to start or stop time counting, therefore it can not be a timer for anything else besides 5000. For the extra SmartGuide that I do not plan to put in the same bathroom with the toothbrushes, I use it as a clock in the other bathroom; it looks nice though.I don\'t have much to say on other fronts. Overall, it is an excellent purchase for young children.Charlie"

I was skeptical because I have been using its direct competitor for about a year, the top-of-the-line Sonicare Flexcare HX6950 with UV Sanitizer, and was very happy with that brush.  A friend of mine has the Oral-B smart series, and when I saw it, I knew I had to give it a try to see what all the hype was about.  I found the opportunity when my father asked me to order him one, so I threw in an extra one for myself.  It arrived in two days from Amazon, brand spanking new.I\'ve used the Orab-B for about a week, 14 times, and I have to say its different than the Sonicare, not necessarily better, but just different, and just as good.  The Oral-B gives you a different kind of clean, and I definitely feel my teeth and gums get a really, really good cleaning after brushing.  My teeth also seem whiter now.  I think the Oral-B removes more plaque off my teeth, and more food from between my teeth due to the optional Floss Action brush head I\'ve been using.  Don\'t be fooled, there is no substitution for flossing, but this brush head does a little for you, especially if you have bigger natural gaps between your teeth, of which I don\'t, so I have to floss.  The Floss Action brush head is really amazing, quite an innovation, and I love it.The wireless SmartGuide is pretty clever too.  It automatically goes on when you turn your toothbrush on.  I can definitely say, that the SmartGuide helps you to brush longer and more thoroughly.  Its almost like a trainer when your brushing, rooting for you to finish 30 seconds on each setting.  I do one cycle for the top teeth, and one cycle for the bottom teeth.  The SmartGuide is very helpful to anyone, no matter your age.  The four different stages of this electric toothbrush are also very helpful, I use them all, and always will.The Oral-B Smart Series 5000 comes with one Floss Action brush head, and one Pro White brush head.  I also ordered a 4 pack of sensitive brush heads, but haven\'t used them yet.  In addition, after seeing how much I like the Floss Action brush head, I ordered more of those, a 3 pack actually.  If your wondering about the price, forget about it, its totally worth it, and will probably save you thousands of dollars worth of needless dental work due to cavities.  I can\'t recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush enough.  In fact, if you have the money, be generous and buy them for other people that can\'t afford one.  Everyone should be able to use one of these, they are that beneficial to oral hygiene.  I can\'t imagine using a regular toothbrush after using an electric one, especially an electric on of this quality.As usual, Amazon is amazing for price, shipping, product quality, and customer service, literally the best store on the planet.  I don\'t even understand how other stores can stay in business with Amazon in existence.  I stopped keeping track of how much money I\'ve spent here in the past 10 years..lol."

The brush performs beautifully, does what it\'s supposed to do effectively, and you can feel the results immediately. The smaller brush size is really great for accessing hard-to-reach places.

I considered switching to a sonic type system but was dismayed at the variety of brush heads that are not interchangeable among the leading brand\'s models. Oral-B brushes are backward and forward compatible between models which means all the spare heads I had on hand work perfectly well with the new 5000. Anyway, it works very well in all modes and I like the ability to keep four different type brushes on the stand. The visual cues, timers and cleaning modes are very handy. The only drawback to this unit is the grotesquely large charger plug which measures 3.5\' long (excluding the prongs!). Seriously? What designer/engineer thought that was a good idea? There must be a way to achieve a charge without a such a titanic plug, like building the charging guts into the stand for example.

As a dentaphobe, I will always be grateful to Sonicare for keeping my mouth cavity free for my 7 year hiatus from the dentist- though to be fair, I also drank mostly water (vs. sugared drinks) and made sure to brush and floss twice daily, chewing sugarless gum throughout the day. Still, I found the Oral B a very nice upgrade for several reasons:1. NO ICKYNESS IN THE BRUSH HEAD!!! Sonicare brushes are notorious for getting all this disgusting gunk stuck up inside the brush head, leaving me with a sense of wonder about what exactly I was putting in my mouth, even after rinsing the head thoroughly in alcohol.2. Smaller brush heads. I finally feel like I am cleaning my wisdom teeth, which stick back almost to the uvula.3. Circular brush heads. Dentists always say to brush in circular motions, yet typical Sonicare brushes only go side to side.4. Using the floss-action head truly leaves less behind when I floss right after brushing.5. Another reviewer mentioned the fact Sonicare does not offer either soft bristled brushes or a sensitive mode.There were a couple downsides:1. Noise. The Oral B seems much louder, likely because the brush is moving in a circle vs. just side to side.2. Vibration Speed. One of Sonicare\'s main tenants for their brushes is that the sonic action itself gets rid of plaque/germs. The Oral B does not seem to vibrate quite as much- though flossing seems to yield fewer hangers-on, and does not just compact any recently-eaten food- such as cracker mush.There are other benefits, which Sonicare has also added to its latest greatest brushes, such as timers and better chargers. Still, I am happy with the switch- I\'ll just see if my dentist notices =)UPDATE; 2011- Going back to Sonicare.I had the brush about a year when the battery started dying ALL the time- would go from 3 of 4 bars to 0 bars in the middle of brushing. If you prefer leaving your brush plugged in all the time, this may not be a problem- but I like my batteries to hold some charge.Also, in the end, I do not feel like the brush is cleaning between the teeth as much as a Sonicare. Likely thanks to all the complainers like myself, I\'ve been exploring Amazon and noticing Sonicare has now created smaller brush heads with only the prong attachment/gotten rid of the ick factor of their bigger brush heads, and made the brushes overall less expensive (under $80).In the midst of the year\'s use, I sucked it up and returned to the dentist... to find I had 7 cavities =( While I obviously can\'t entirely blame the Oral B for this result, I again cite that the brush did not seem to clean as well between teeth/I miss the sonic action of the Sonicare- and did leave any late night cracker/chip remnants pushed down on my back teeth. So look for a new review of the latest Sonicare brush soon!"

Prior reviewers have already commented on the power converter that sticks 3 inches out from the electrical wall plug - duh. Also the enigma of how to open the battery compartment of the \'Smart Guide Display unit\'. (TWO covers to be removed with gorilla fingers, sliding each in opposite directions.)Fortunately the rechargeable (Ni-MH) battery in the handle can be replaced (compared to the older Braun models that became useless once the battery died), but how to change the battery is a deeper mystery. (Amidst the very poorly written instructions, the section for replacing the rechargeable battery provides only a small diagram that is utterly unintelligible.) I went to the [...] website and clicked on \'email us\', but what a bad joke that was - I just ended in an endless search option in their FAQ section. Next I\'ll call them at [...].Oh, then you have to remember twice a year to not use the battery charger, so that the battery discharges completely in order to \'maintain the maximum capacity of the rechargeable body\'. (Since a full charge is claimed to last at least 10 days, I suppose one then turns on the toothbrush and leaves it running on the bathroom counter... hoping the internal moving parts don\'t wear out in the process.)CRITICAL: In these days of airline security concerns, if you bring the toothbrush with you (as my dentist recommends), DON\'T FORGET to deactivate the radio transmitter that is built into the toothbrush handle (to communicate with the \'Smart Guide display unit\').In summary: This is a fabulous toothbrush (10x better than my previous Braun model) but a disaster on the \'user friendliness\' scale. I can only hope that in the next few years Braun\'s competition will \'eat their lunch\' with something yet better and much simpler to use!"

Rinse the whole thing under water, dry and stand in its recharger.  That\'s it.

No big deal, right?  Well, then, why not get the description right?  I am disturbed by false advertising, even at the level of how many brush heads are included; makes me wonder what else is wrong in the description.2. The door to the battery compartment on the SmartSense unit is very hard to remove.  It slides about an eighth of an inch and then you have to pick it off.  That is very unclear and the manual does not give directions on how to remove it without breaking it.  If you have any problems with your fingers, you may not be able to get it open since it requires a lot of force to move the back that one eighth of an inch.  That is a problem, especially since the SmartSense unit is one of the reasons this unit is so expensive.  I went to the Oral-B website to find a solution for this problem and there was none.  The website is purely a marketing site.This product is advertised with great features, and others have given it good reviews.  It had better be great or this is one customer who will take advantage of the 60-day money back guarantee."

Use this product as part of the following regiment,"My best friend is in his final year as a dental student.  He recommended to me these following products:1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson & Johnson5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.This is the regiment he advised me to follow:1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it\'s the best time of day for using fluoride.3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \'glides\' right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \'grips\' the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it\'s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don\'t even think about it!5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don\'t have to wonder \'did I brush good enough\'. It tells you when you are done!CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.

Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don\'t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don\'t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don\'t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.

The strength of the brushing on \'normal\' mode is certainly not gentle, but then again, that\'s what the \'sensitive\' mode is for. We always use the normal mode and we\'ve had no issues.

But few complains about this specific model 5000.1) The handle on 5000 is much bigger than on other similar toothbrushes. It is less comfortable to hold in hand.2) The extra device coming with model 5000 is useless. It is supposedly an \'advanced\' timer which makes beeping noise when you need to switch sides of teeth to brush and when to stop brusing. I think, timers embedded in the toothbrush handle itself (what they do for less expensive models) do better job - there is absolutely no benefits to have timer separately (in addition it\'s screen is hard to see).3)The electric plug on this toothbrush is much longer than on other models. The base, though, is much smaller. Apparently they moved electronics from the base (where toothbrush stands) to the plug. It does not look good when plug is plugged in recepticle and it makes dificulties always to avoid pushing the plug.4) Another big complain - never received rebate. it was $50 rebate for this toothbrush when I bought it in August.

They do a wonderful job cleaning and brushing is a pleasure instead of a chore.  (I have tooth sensitivity and I love the stiff bristles--soft bristles bother my teeth.)  Today I accidentally picked up the Crossaction Pro-Health and I was certainly disappointed.  I noticed the last set of bristles was green instead of white and the head size said large instead of full, but I thought Oral-B had just done a product makeover.  To my disappointment, the Crossaction Pro-Health cannot compare to the original Crossaction.  I just bought the Pro-Health today and the bristles are softer than those of my 3 month old used original Crossaction brush.  If Pro-Health was in big letters and they didn\'t look so similar I wouldn\'t complain, but the toothbrushes look exactly alike and Pro-Health is *tiny* on the packaging, so small that I didn\'t even notice it until I got the packaging out of the trash to include the UPC in my letter to Oral-B regarding the suspected makeover.  And that is how long it took me to realize that Oral-B hadn\'t done a makeover, I just bought the wrong brush.  Ugh...  Do yourself a big favor and buy the Oral-B Crossaction Toothbrush instead of the Oral-B Crossaction Pro-Health Toothbrush.  Happy brushing Amazonians. :)UPDATE:  The Pro-Health version has replaced the original version and you can\'t get the original.  :\'("

I purchased they for the rest of the family and my 11 year old is doing a much better brushing.I\'ve never had any problems with this toothbrush running low on power, even when I\'m away from home (and the charger) for a few days.Original Review: (Sept 2010)I\'ve been using the Oral-B power toothbrush for a few weeks now and I\'m very pleased with it. Other electric toothbrushes did an ok job, but they usually had problems with getting gummed up with residue or lacked much in the energy department.The Oral-B power toothbrush has a brush head that\'s about 1/2\' in diameter that consists of a small rubber cup in the middle and is surrounded by bristles on the edges. I\'m able to maneuver it easily to the every tooth surface and get the some spots that I couldn\'t get to with a conventional brush. I find that I\'m able to get away with using about half of the toothpaste I did before. As a result, much less is wasted and there are no excess globs of toothpaste getting washed down the drain.One feature I really love is the inductive charging base. It doesn\'t have any exposed contacts, which means the brush is easy to rinse off after I brush. The base is easy to keep clean for the same reason.The power switch is behind a flexible rubber part of the grip and is easy to turn on and off. The brush isn\'t especially quiet when it runs, but that\'s not a big deal. It\'s not deafening either.It\'s doing a great job keeping my teeth cleaned with much less effort than a regular brush. I\'m very happy with it."

I\'m also concerned that some of the power brushes are too powerful - my teeth get sensitive. After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I\'ve been doing pretty well with the cheap Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary). Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.It\'s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it\'s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn\'t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that\'s it. I think that when the battery dies it\'s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn\'t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don\'t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn\'t a concern for me. I\'m planning to buy this brush for my children to try. For an entry level power brush, this is a solid choice."

I\'m used to a little abrasive feeling when bristles hit my teeth and gums. I like a good \'feel\' for my brush, if you know what I mean. I find that most soft brushes don\'t do enough in removing grit and tartar from my teeth. So, when I tried this, I was about to give it away or throw it in the trash. But, then I did a double-take and ran my tongue across my teeth and looked at them carefully in the mirror. And, whaddyah know? It got every little speckle off of my teeth. It made them feel polished like I had just got out of the dentist. This is the first gentle toothbrush that I\'ve used that actually works well. It works better than even some of the medium and more firm bristle ones I\'ve used in the past. A keeper for sure!"

I really can tell the difference in my teeth\'s cleanliness and shine after only three days. I especially notice the difference on the biting surfaces, which seem smoother somehow. I also notice that when I floss after using this product, there is less \'stuff\' pulled out by the floss. I take that discovery to mean that this brush really does get in between teeth to remove food that normal brushes miss.A couple of other interesting features.1 - after 2 minutes, the brush noticeably pulses to alert you that you have passed the first brushing milestone - the minimum recommended brushing time. After 2 additional minutes, it pulses you again to let you know you should stop, having reached the recommended maximum brushing time. My wife, an exceptionally conscientious brusher, was amazed at how long 2 minutes really is. She had been under brushing for a long time.2 - The recharger acts as a stand for the unit, but you do not need to keep it plugged in to an outlet. A full charge lasts at least a week or more.3 - The unit seems well engineered, is easy to hold and the brush heads that come with the unit seem to fit \'just right\' in the mouth.4 - The first time I used it, the vibration was a bit surprising. It took my 2 or 3 uses until the novelty wore off, though brushing my tongue results is still a work in process. By the way, for those worried about sensitivity to vibration, I have mildly sensitive teeth, and the vibration has caused absolutely NO discomfort to any of my teeth.5 - Some people mention in their reviews that the brush was harsh on the gums the first time that they used it. I agree that the brush is a bit stiff the first time you use it, but after 1-2 uses, they seemed to soften a bit and now the brush seems to be very gentle on my gums.My only problem with this unit is that my wife and I are going to fight over it when I travel on business...Actually, there are a couple of short comings, but these should be easy to address. First, both of the brushing heads (which are detachable) are identical. A color band or some other distinguishing mark would be helpful to people sharing the device. Also, there is no battery indicator. I found out this morning that the battery was dying, when in the period of 30 seconds, the brush went from what seemed like full power to no power at all. Recharging it for 5 minutes allowed me to finish, but that\'s not an acceptable design choice. Perhaps a small red LED or an audible chime alerting users to a low battery will make it in to future designs."

The first thing he said to me after trying was, \'Wow ... it\'s a little aggressive, isn\'t it?\'It IS a little powerful, but boy does it ever get your teeth clean! Both of us noticed after just two or three days that our teeth were noticeably whiter and less stained. They also just FEEL really clean -- that \'just left the dentist\' feeling (the clean part, not the Novocain part).The only reason I\'m not rating this five stars is because it may be too much for those with really sensitive gums, and I\'m also a little curious about what long-term use could do to enamel if you\'re not careful.

We own two, rechargeable, Oral B toothbrush bases and each child and I has our own brushhead that simply snaps on and off.In comparison to brushing with a manual toothbrush, the Oral B electric toothbrush is a far superior brushing solution. You can\'t really compare manual brushing to an Oral B anymore than you can compare a bike to a car.  A bike will get you there, but not as quickly or comfortably as a car. The oral B accesses harder to reach areas of your mouth easier than a manual toothbrush, and the brush spins much faster than you could ever hope to brush on your own.In comparison to other electric toothbrushes, I chose the Oral B because it was far more economical than other brands. It is affordable, and the brush replacement costs are very reasonable, especially when you buy bulk packages here or at a warehouse store.Now, on to this specific Oral B brushhead.  The base unit also works with the standard Oral B brushheads that I already use.  This brush head is slightly more oval shaped to mimic a tooth\'s surface and shape, versus the circular standard brushhead.  It also has a polishing cup in the center of the brush head where brush bristles would normally be present on the standard, circular brush head. So, picture the standard brush head with a polishing cup in the dead center of the brush head and you can get a mental picture of this new brush head\'s design.With the more powerful motor and new brush head, I like this Oral B better than the standard Oral B that I have been using.  It cleans even better and I really like the polishing cup since I am a heavy coffee drinker and try to minimize teeth staining.  While you can\'t go wrong with any of the Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes, I would recommend this one.  If you are still using a manual toothbrush, I would strongly suggest at least trying out an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  If you do, you will never go back to manual brushing again.UPDATE.......After using this brush head for several months now, I am convinced that it has made my teeth more white. I had worked it into my normal brushing routine and had forgotten about it.  I started to notice my teeth seemed whiter, and I couldn\'t figure out why.  I started thinking about it and realized the only change was the brush head and more powerful motor.  (my toothpaste was the same)."

By way of full disclosure, I have been using the Oral B Cross-action toothbrush for a number of months, and in the past I used a Sonicare toothbrush.For whatever reason, I keep seeing more and more electric toothbrushes lately, each of which is supposed to be the \'latest and greatest\' design.  Frankly, I can\'t see the difference between many of them.  Maybe there are incremental changes that make them worth the sometimes excessive cost, but who knows?  And of course, manufacturers seem to be pretty generous with dental offices, which seem to either display the Oral B brand or Sonicare, or both.  But I suspect that the results between the various brands are pretty similar.This toothbrush is very similar to my Cross-action, the key differences being (i) it lacks the cross action brushes below the oscillating head, (ii) it has a 2 minute timer, and (iii) it\'s rechargable.  Frankly, I prefer the cross-action brushes, but that\'s not crically important.  I do really like the 2 minute timer, and the fact it\'s rechargable.  It does a good job cleaning, and the timer is a nice feature.From my perspective, I don\'t think that the brushes that sell for $70+ are worth the money.  Far from it.  The Cross action does a fine job on my teeth, and this brush is pretty comparable, with the added plusses of being rechargable and having the two minute timer.  So I think this is a good buy for the money, and I would recommend it.

I was truly sad when the poor ol\' guy bit the dust. After a week without an electric toothbrush I realized I needed to get another and researched Sonicare vs. OralB/Braun. I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn\'t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 & 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I\'m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn\'t expecting that big of a difference.The only thing I don\'t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn\'t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn\'t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.

My teeth have never been cleaner, nor my gums so pink!It was jarring at first, even on the sensitive setting but nowhere near as bad as my husband\'s. I liked how the timer indicates each thirty seconds so I can move on to the next quadrant, and then when two minutes have passed (since that is the dentist-recommended amount of time.) My husband gets annoyed that the toothbrush does not automatically shut off like his does but I think I prefer it this way because I often spend more than 2 minutes on my teeth. I also like how small the head is; I can reach places on my back teeth that were inaccessible before.The pressure sensor never worked on my model, which is a shame because I do believe I brush hard. Just to test it out, I bore down so hard on the brush that the motor bogged down but still the sensor did not come on which led me to believe it\'s a malfunction. Hopefully I am in the minority. If you purchase this product, be sure to test it out before the warranty runs out.Otherwise, I\'ve been very happy with it. My teeth feel polished, they\'re not more sensitive than usual and I\'m overall pleased."

The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush. I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well. Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH. I stand by this toothbrush as a high-quality product. It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.>>I have 5 dental implants, so taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.At a recent visit to my dentist I was told I had receeding gums around one of my implants. The problem? Part of it was that the implant crown wasn\'t seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard. The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.I went to Target and bought their generic \'Up & Up\' brand electric toothbrush. This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums. However, when the Oral-b 3000 came out on Amazon Vine, I knew I had to order & review it.The Oral-b 3000 does NOT disappoint. For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic \'Up & Up\' model I was using before. Second, it actually lights up when you\'re brushing too hard. I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I\'m distracted and in a hurry to get to work. It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.Another nice feature is the \'timer\' function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits. This is also nice, as many of us tend to hurry through our brushing routine. The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom. The brush unit\'s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn\'t notice a decrease in power. This is a nice contrast with my Up & Up toothbrush which, though it claims it\'ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.I\'ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far. My old unit is in storage and probably won\'t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas. I haven\'t made use of the different brushing modes, but I\'m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth, will appreciate these.All in all the brush unit, brush head, and charger included in this package are all great and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than, the competing brands/brushes. The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth & gums, the unit pays for itself handily. I recommend!"

I\'d been considering trying out an electric toothbrush for a couple years now, after issues with gingivitis. However, the expense of a unit deterred me from purchasing one. The Oral-b 3000 is a sturdy unit, easy to use, and in a word of a novice user, quite a bizarre experience.To move from manually brushing your teeth to an electric brush requires a period of adjustment. The unit is very easy to use, and comes with features that make decisions about brushing teeth easier. For example, the unit recommends brushing each side of the mouth for thirty seconds; thirty seconds for upper left, thirty seconds for lower left. The unit actually pulsates at you when its time to switch, so little thought is required.Another feature I appreciate is that if you apply too much pressure to the brush, the unit will let you know by slowing down. It\'s a feature designed to protect the tooth from hard waring action. I do appreciate that.The bizarreness of the experience is the actual brushing. The sensation of whirring against my teeth immediately transported myself to my dentist\'s chair (never a pleasant time, in my opinion). Perhaps it was the sound as well. The sensation of a pulsating unit in my mouth brought up images of drills, and cavities; not all together pleasant.One drawback is already mentioned in another review. When the unit\'s rechargable batteries die, so do the unit. I\'m not sure how long they will last, but I would have to ask myself, would I spend money on another electric toothbrush when this one dies? At this point I cannot say for sure. I need to give the unit time to see if it is effective, and I\'ll know more from my dental hygeinist after my next dental appointment."

So I was curious to see what all the fuss was about.It certainly is easy to set up, and after 17 hours of battery charging, a simple task to operate.I must say though that it takes a little getting used to, for those of us old-time \'toothbrushers\'.  But after adjusting to the weird feel of something electrical in contact with the moisture in your mouth, and the buzzing vibrating sensations on your teeth, it didn\'t take too long to get the hang of it.You still need to do some serious flossing, and ?I think this device might even be pushing some food particles into those post-molar crevices, so don\'t forget to use the Interdental brush and floss in there too.So far, it seems like an easy modern way to ensure basic dental hygiene, and I\'m satisfied with the results.

After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can\'t see because it\'s inside the column. It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next day.The directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable. I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000% markup.I tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.Caveat emptor."

Ok not really but it is a sweet little tooth brush. I love that it\'s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue you can put it on soft mode. The charger you see in the picture can actually come apart so you are left with a tiny stand if you want instead of the big face. The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist saying \'you\'re brushing your teeth too hard\' which can be very bad for you. Finally the cost. You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning. My mouth was a little sore but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \'I bet you haven\'t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\' I actually told him that wasn\'t true...I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing. My teeth feel the same as going to a dentist (plus I floss twice a day), every day..what more can you ask for.Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes... you get what you pay for period.

While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  My last toothbrush had a tiny LED screen built into the brush that displayed battery life.  However, after about a year, this screen shorted out and became useless. The unit eventually just gave out and I had to replace it.I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard. I wish I actually had this feature years ago because I was brushing too hard and scrubbed away much of my enamel.It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  There are better brushes for you gums.  However, if I could give half stars, I would give this unit a 4.5/5 star rating.Oral-B was also running a promo at the time; if you buy an qualifying unit, you can receive an 50% mail in rebate.  So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  So for $40, this is a great brush.  This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard no matter which unit/brand you buy. I also like that it takes up a small amount of space on my countertop; I wish the power cord was detachable for easier storage though - not a big deal however.All in all, it is a good brush.  It is a straightforward unit that has just the right amount of features without paying an arm and a leg."

UP UNTIL I went for a checkup and I was told I had 2 cavities all the way in the back of my molars of my upper jaw. My dentist showed me pics too. Eww! I always felt that my toothbrush couldn\'t ever reach that far and this is what I get. TWO disgusting cavities. I had it filled, but the week before I had it done I immediately searched on amazon for this electronic toothbrush. Now, I can\'t live without it. I feel it\'s cleaning my teeth down to a micro-level AND it\'s so easy to brush for 2 minutes because the electronic toothbrush notifies you when time is up. I definitely wouldn\'t count 120 seconds (I\'ve never ever ever in my life brushed for that long). THANK YOU ORAL-B!! Thank you AMAZON!

I have sensitive teeth at the gum line and my dentist said that the \'sonic\' action irritates the sensitivity and to use only once a day (use regular toothbrush on other brushings).  I like using electric toothbrushes because I have forearm and elbow pain from the manual tooth brushing up and down action. Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms. I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  The negative reviews I read seemed like they were isolated instances of the toothbrush going out shortly after purchase, and was not the \'norm.\'  I thought that if I ended up with a \'bad egg\' toothbrush, Amazon would replace easily (as stated in some reviews I read).  I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  And surprisingly, the little \'rubber pieces\' that act as \'floss action\' actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums feel great and look clean after brushing.  Some other bonus items I liked about this product: came with 2 brush heads, so won\'t need to replace heads for at least 6 months; also liked the 2 minute timer alert, but not shutting off so I can finish brushing when I chose to turn it off. I would recommend this toothbrush as a mid-level electric toothbrush, where you don\'t have to buy replacement batteries, yet don\'t value the \'upgrade\' pressure sensing, sonic, covered brush head, multiple handles, etc. of the high-level electric toothbrushes."

My dentist has told me that I need to floss regularly since my gums are receding.  This toothbrush a little louder than I expected, but remember this is my first power toothbrush.  I really like the two minute timer feature becuase my dentist always told me that I was always \'over\' brushing.  Since brushing with an up and down movement can wear off the enamel (as told by my dentist), the Oral-B toothbrush uses oscillating and rotating movement which dentists prefer.  The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited warranty.Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.

That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that\'s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it\'s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you\'ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It\'s not like they\'ll go stale in the linen closet.Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.Hints:Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you\'re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you\'re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you\'ll do a serious \'eewwww.\'  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.  This is important.Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger. This will make that weekend maintenance simpler.That\'s it! Now get one for yourself and see."

In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.This Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more toothpaste.What I do like:>>  The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all.  Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  Trust me on this.>>  The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.>>  I love the rubber grip handle.  My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.>>  Will go over a week between charges.  I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging.>>  Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.What I do NOT like:>>  No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.>>  The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I\'ve ever encountered.  My knife gouged into the rubber hand grip and I nearly cut myself twice.  If you have the option of choosing this with frustration-free packaging, get that one instead.I hate visiting my dentist.

Keep in mind that the toothbrush will not actually floss your teeth as it\'s simply a selling point to highlight that it reaches places that others may miss. If this toothbrush is anything like my previous Oral B purchases, it will be with me for a long time.One should keep in mind that the replacement heads for these toothbrushes is not cheap. I would also compare them to the price you pay for cartridges as the manufacturer looks to minimize the initial outlay (as is the case with printers) while cashing in later.

The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  I can\'t comment on the alleged \'flossing action\' since I still floss and I\'m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven\'t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  The things we do for oral hygiene.So yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B\'s Vitality.  That\'s just your teeth and gums howling like Westley from The Princess Bride being tortured.  Well, your teeth and gums are wimps.  They\'ll get used to it and thank you later.  Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you\'ve just had a professional cleaning.  The secret, of course is the much-vaunted circular buffing motion.  You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  Problem solved.  Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there\'s not a lot to complain about.  If you\'ve got the bucks and a hankering for oral hygiene, then you could surely do worse than to invest in Vitality."

That\'s one big advantage of the Oral B -- you can buy different heads to use for different purposes. The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.My only complaint is that there\'s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it\'s fully charged or when the charge is low. It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors. When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working.

After brushing with this, my teeth get that slick, super-clean feeling that you don\'t always get with a regular brush.I really like how it charges on a plastic base.  The hole the charger plugs into is all plastic, and the charger itself is all plastic - no places to corrode! It also has a small footprint so it leaves plenty of space on the countertop.

I have the more expensive model that briefly stops every 15 seconds so you know when to change quadrants in your mouth.I got this  \'Vitality Floss Action\' brush and have to say that for the money I think one would be hard pressed to find a better buy.I agree with the other positive reviewers on all the important points but most importantly to me is VALUE. This toothbrush does an excellent job of brushing and massaging the gums. Furthermore, I believe there are different specialty brush head replacements that can be purchased. It DOES have a two minute time. In my opinion this is just as good if not better than having a 15 second timer. If you just brush your whole mouth for the full two minutes you\'ll get just as thorough and perhaps more so than if you do 15 seconds peer quadrant because you\'ll have almost as much paste on the brush for the other quadrants of your mouth. With the 15 second per quadrant type of brushing, by the time you get to the final quadrant you\'ve pretty much used all the fresh tooth paste.This is a bare bones electric toothbrush. It doesn\'t come with a travel case but I love it and see no reason to spend an extra $100 for a fancier Oral B or the other leading competitor."

Healthy for the gums.It was really amazing. It felt incredibly clean and especially clear of foreign materials. I am a flosser by nature as well..and I noticed after several days of usage...that my flossing showed less and less particles between my teeth.

There is no battery replacement however because it is magnetically charged the hand unit does not plug intothe wall. Free from cord or plug issues being close to water.It was packed well and comes complete with operational instructions as well as infomation on how to brush properly with it.

The Braun manufactured brush comes with the recharger base and 2 floss action brush heads for under $30 from Amazon which strikes me as, perhaps, the best bargain of all available powered brushes on the market because of the high quality and effective design.I\'ve been using the Sonicare system for roughly the last three years and I do love it, but the handle is bulky and the brush heads are expensive to replace.  I always have wondered if there was anything out there that was as good or better?  Enter this system...It actually seems to clean every bit as good, maybe better, and it makes my gums feel much more \'alive\' than the Sonicare does.  Judging by sink remnants it truly does clean at least as well, if not better.  I\'m guessing the floss action heads are truly small engineering marvels as they do seem to actually do what the name implies.  The size of the head suits me well after initially getting use to it.  That, combined with the more svelte handle allows me to easily get to the back of my teeth quite easily, better than the Sonicare IMHO.It is impossible to ignore that this system comes in noticably less in cost than the Sonicare too.  I\'ll still, on occassion, use the Sonicare, but this is my new favorite because it\'s effective cleaning and I really love the better stimulated feeling of my gums.  In fact, I will just say it:  I feel my teeth are cleaner and my gums much more invigorated with this winning product.  For me there are few downsides to this unit that I can think of.  Maybe the only thing I\'d like to have seen added was a brush guard, or holder, for sliding around the brush head when traveling...Otherwise, Oral B has hit a real \'homerun\' with this product which I feel works great, I enjoy immensely, and is a decent bargain too."

It really was an impressive sight to see.I\'m not saying to buy this toothbrush as an excuse to not floss, but if you do skip flossing; this brush will do a portion of that job.Their is a timer that after 2 minutes it stops briefly then keeps on going and repeats this cycle 2 or 3 times and then just keepes moving like normal so you know it\'s likely been long enoughI have only been using this for about two weeks and have had no battery, or any other issues at this point.To me this is a really good toothbrush that lets me get my teeth and gums cleaner than I had been.

So I\'ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea. It\'s now just a question of which one to get.In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh. We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it\'s doing a great job. It\'s not \'too mild\'. Our dentist praises us on how well our teeth are cared for. I don\'t see the need for the extra agitation this unit gives.There are no LEDs anywhere that we can see to indicate this unit is charging. It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn\'t being wasted.There\'s similarly no battery indicator.Finally, with the Sonicare, you get a blink every 30 seconds to change mouth quadrants. That way at the end of 2 minutes you know you\'ve handled each quadrant evenly. With this one, you solely get a buzz at the end of 2 minutes to tell you you\'re done. So you have to manage your time yourself. I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually - but there\'s many features they left out."

While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I\'m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn\'t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don\'t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I\'d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I\'ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I\'m not a dental health professional, so I don\'t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn\'t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it\'s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can\'t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I\'m afraid I don\'t care for it enough to do even that).If you\'re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I\'ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn\'t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums."

The design of the handle was well thought out and easy to charge and use.  The footprint that was necessary on the counter was amazingly small.  BUT, and it is a big \'but\' the head was too big for even an adult mouth.  I am a grown person and asked my daughter to try it.  She could barely get it in her mouth and could not maneuver it to reach her teeth with gagging.  They need to try and overcome the space needed to make the mechanicals of a swirling AND a scrubbing head able to occupy the space at the end of the brush that is supposed to fit in your mouth.  It is nice that they have designed different heads to address different issues related to plaque and gums, but if you can only reach the front region of your teeth with it, your dental health would seem to suffer.

It gets every speck of plaque off of my teeth, even in the hard to reach areas.  Unlike an old powered toothbrush I once had, it doesn\'t require a special toothpaste, and can use your favorite kind.  Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  I\'m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time. (You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about oral hygiene.)The toothbrush comes with a sealed plastic charger, which will charge the brush overnight.  A full charge will give you a week\'s worth of brushing. (14 x 2 minutes) This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.  You can also store the brush on the charger, but this isn\'t the most ecological way of charging the brush.  It also comes with one refill, and additional refills are available here on Amazon."

Fortunately, this model has a built-in timer, which notifies you that it\'s time to stop or you\'ll overdo it. That is a very nice feature. The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth. After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning. The brush is also smaller and requires you to use less toothpaste, which will result in savings over time. The only downside is that the brushes are a little on the pricey side, but I\'m hoping they last longer than my regular brush.If you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush. Not only does it do a great job at cleaning teeth, I\'m sure this will result in less cavities when I get my dental check-ups."

It is powerful and leaves your mouth feeling like you have had a good tooth and gum scrubbing and massage.  While doing a great job it is gentle enough that leaves you wanting to more.  I tend to be somewhat lax about how long I brush.  This lets you know how long to brush in increments and before long you are done.  It leaves you wanting to keep right on a brushing.  You can put different kinds of brushes on it if you like and that is a nice feature.  Highly recommended.

At first, I was a little bit wary of the dual heads on the toothbrush.  This toothbrush really has a lot of power behind it.  I don\'t have any sensitive areas in my mouth and I don\'t know if that would be an issue otherwise.  Regardless, I noticed that as I drove to work, my front teeth REALLY felt smooth.  Much more than normal.Out of the box, you get the toothbrush, the stand and an extra head.  I haven\'t checked prices for replacement brushes yet but so far so good.  Also the battery has lasted a solid week of brushing.  That has been a nice thing so I can put the charger away for most of the week and take back most of the counter space.Pros: works really well!  Talk about clean teeth.  I feel like my mouth went through a super duper car wash.Cons: a little noisy and might be almost too powerful for some."

Quite efficient.Not only is it rechargeable, but it holds a charge for a good while. The toothbrush even comes with a timer that pulses instead of cutting off. It comes with an additional brush head and a small, stand-up charger as well.I don\'t usually have such strong feelings over a toothbrush, but my teeth actually do look/feel cleaner.

They should have used a nickel metal hydride or lithium ion/polymer rechargeable battery instead. Or, include an option to use regular AA batteries. Ni-Cad batteries are notoriously memory prone and don\'t really last long at all. In fact, the instructions for this unit state not to leave the charger/stand plugged in unless the unit is ready to be charged up. This is because if you charge it when it isn\'t fully drained, the battery will not last as long on subsequent charges due to the memory issue. Oral-b should be ashamed of themselves for incorporating such a lame battery in what could be a more useful product with a better internal battery.Luckily, I have an old Oral-b power toothbrush that takes regular AA batteries and the brushes from this unit fit on it! So, when the stupid ni-cad battery on this unit fails, I can use my old base and regular AA batteries but still use the dual head brush attachment.I can\'t recommend anyone buy this based on the fact that the battery is not viable. If you can find one that takes regular batteries I think that would be better for you (you can use rechargeable in that if you want)."

I wanted to see if a less expensive electric toothbrush, if it was comparable to the more expensive electric toothrushes, like the one I have been using for years now, and have been very satisfied with.This electric toothbrush doesn\'t have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive electric toothbrush, such as the ability to choose from more than one setting, or a UV sanitizer.I have to say tho that this electric toothbrush made my teeth feel like they were really being scrubbed, so when I was finished using it, my teeth felt very clean.  This electric toothbrush came with 2 brush heads, which seem alittle bigger than the more tapered ones Iam used to using, and this motor seemed to be alittle louder. It actually would slow down, then rev back up.  The automatic timer on this electric toothbrush is supposed to run for 2 minutes, but mine seemed to run for much longer than that, so I went with it.My other electric toothbrush runs for 3 minutes at the setting I use, so I didn\'t mind this.  You always have the option of just turning it off when you want to.I wish this electric toothbrush came with some kind of cover for the toothbrush heads, and some kind of travel case, but for the excellent price of this electric toothrush I can\'t complain.  It does come with a rechargeable stand, which I just leave my electric toothbrush always plugged in, and on the rechargeable stand.  That way it is always ready to use when I need it.I also like that in reading the information that came with this electric toothbrush, that you have like 5 different options for brush heads, depending on the kind you like.  The brush heads seem to be alittle more reasonably priced too, as I always like to buy a minimum of 3 brush heads at a time.  With this electric toothbrush you can even buy them in a quantity of 6, if you want to.  I like to have enough for a year, which they recommend you change your brush head every 3 months, which I agree, so I do that.If you\'ve always wondered if you would like using an electric toothbrush, but didn\'t want to spend the big bucks, you should try this electric toothbrush.  It works very well, at a reasonable price.The major reason to use an electric toothbrush to begin with is to really clean your teeth and gums, which this one seems to do that as well as my more expensive electric toothbrush.Having healthy teeth and gums is so important to your overall health.  Everyone should be able to afford to have an electric toothbrush. I know some of the electric toothbrushes are cost prohibitive, at over $100, but this Oral B electric toothbrush is under $30, much more doable for alot of people.I will continue to use this electric toothbrush, along with the other electric toothbrush I already have.Iam very happy that I was able to try this product, and very satisfied with the results I got."

A lot of the electric toothbrushes I have tried have left my gums red and irritated, so I stop using them after the first use.I was actually excited to try the Oral B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush.This works really good! I have been using it for all my brushings (at least 2 times a day) for the past few days and it does not hurt or irritate my teeth or gums in the slightest- so needless to say this is a keeper!The bristles are really working hard getting between the teeth and removing all the food particles and debris. The top part of the brush goes in circles and the lower part of the brush goes up and down and really gets in there-- and without irritating!The timer is great also! Sometimes I feel like I am rushing when I brush my teeth, but with the built in 2 minute timer, I know that I am not exactly rushing through and well, its doing a great job in those 2 minutes.I am not finding any left over food when I floss afterwards either which really shows that this toothbrush is doing its job.Also, since this is rechargeable, I dont have to worry about constantly changing the battery- so that saves time and money!!There is an extra toothbrush head that I decided to use one and my husband the other one. He does not have a problem with sensitive teeth or gums.

Please note that I have been using this same type of toothbrush head on my Oral B electric toothbrush for at least 2 years without ever having a problem. And when the ones I purchased at Amazon failed, I went to Walmart and bought a replacement, and it works fine. Because I didn\'t start using the toothbrushes until about 3 months after purchase, the seller refused to accept a return or to refund my money.

I got it about a year ago from my dentist\'s office, and absolutely love it.  The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...the savings is very significant!).I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn\'t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it\'s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren\'t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don\'t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)"

And it will leave your hair weighed down. After a few days of using it, your hair will have a waxy residue on it that is supposed to \'imitate\' healthy, soft, and silky hair.The smartest thing you can do right now is pitch all commercial brands like Pantene, Aussie, Herbal Essences, etc and go Organic!

I told them about my confusion (and that I obviously didn\'t read the entire name) and they actually sent me coupons to buy the correct product.I have curly hair & I want to have curly hair but I was out of conditioner so I used the Curls to Straight.  I thought my hair was untangled and smooth just like I like it.  I did not find that it straightened my curls.  Maybe they expect you to use it with other products and try to straighten your hair (like blow dry it straight)?  I used it for a couple of weeks before the coupons arrived and I replaced it with the other product.

Initially frizzy & poofy the day I wash, but frizz mostly dies after i sleep on it.I usually alternate between wearing my hair curly, flat ironing it, or just doing nothing to it and tying it back in a bun.  But the past few months I had given up on wearing my hair curly because I was tired of all the bad products out there. They either did nothing to combat my frizzies, left my curls looking thin and \'scrunchy\', or left my hair just totally flat, which is quite the accomplishment because I have very long, thick hair with a lot of natural volume.My prayers are answered with the Pantene Pro-V Curly line!! I usually always try & use organic products on my hair (without sulfites and stuff) so I was hesitant to try this. But I\'m so glad I did. I bought the shampoo, the conditioner, the mousse & the hairspray. Together they are awesome! After my shower i wrapped my hair in a towel on top of my head, after about 10 minutes i undid the towel, then gently (i try not to toussle my hair around too much when its wet because i feel as if this makes it more frizzy) ran a moderate amount of mouse throughout my curls, separating them and making sure i coat all my hair.I let my hair air dry and occasionally twisted a few curls here and there with my finger and added a teenny tiny bit more mousse here and there where i thought it was starting to frizz up. My curls look extra curly, lots of volume, not crunchy at all & it helped with the frizz A LOT too. I used the hairspray VERY sparingly, i feel as if this is the only product in the line that may cause any sort of \'crunchiness\', so be careful with that one. Just don\'t use too much.I will use this line whenever i want to wear my hair curly (which will now be more often) but I will stick with my organic shampoos for all other times.Also, ***side note***, I was due for a trim when i tried this product so the ends of my hair were very frayed, and anyone with curly hair knows that just makes your hair look even MORE frizzy. So i used a dollop of \'nexxus pro mend  leave in treatment creme\' on my ends and...AMAZING! I know it doesn\'t really \'mend\' my split ends, but it does temporarily bind them together making them practically invisible (until i wash my hair again) and cuts down on almost all the frizz, so my ends look awesome. So i suggest adding that to your curly hair routine if you have split ends "

The product claims to \'moisturize, control frizz and define curls,\' and while the results aren\'t miraculous, one can expect the hair to feel and look smoother, moisturized, and less frizzy after conditioning with this product (compared with no conditioner). It seems to be my experience that, if I blow-dry my hair completely after conditioning with this product, the hair looks somewhat smooth, but full and light at the same time (not weighed down). However, if you\'d like some \'defined curls,\' you might want to air-dry your hair a little rather than blow-drying it completely.

The more expensive brands leave your hair feeling softer and less tangle-y than the cheaper versions do, and this conditioner definitely feels nice on the hair and leaves it very soft and manageable.I have curly hair so I thought I would give this one a try.  It\'s a good conditioner, but is it any better for my hair than say any other Pantene conditioner on the market?  I\'d have to say no.  I can\'t tell the difference between using this formulation or the regular Pantene.  My hair still requires me to put anti-frizz products in it, and it doesn\'t look any different after using this conditioner than another kind quite honestly.But that aside, the reason to buy this particular product is that this DOES leave hair soft and able to be combed right out of the shower (unlike some cheap conditioners) so that is why I give it 4 stars.  I don\'t believe there is any conditioner on the market currently that can truly manage the frizz of curly hair, and probably there never will be.  You will always have to follow your same routine and use additional product after your shower if you need to control the frizz inherent in curly hair. "

It\'s a nice thick conditioner which controls the frizz and helps to detangle your hair in the shower.My hair type is thick and coarse and naturally wavy and tends to frizz. I usually use a leave in glossing cream after I wash my hair to detangle my hair without breakage and to keep my hair from becoming a frizzy mess.I live in Texas and right now the summer is coming on and it\'s hot and humid so it\'s the perfect recipe for my hair to frizz.The first time I used this conditioner was after swimming and there was no way I could run a comb through my hair without help.  After shampooing with my normal shampoo I was able to detangle my hair using the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner in the shower with no breakage. The conditioner is thick so it coats my hair well while in the shower but it doesn\'t feel as if the conditioner rinses completely out of the hair.However after stepping out of the shower and toweling off the conditioning results weren\'t there and I still felt as I needed something to help comb my wet hair.I believe the reason for this is, is because of one of the ingredients used in this conditioner called \'Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\'.  Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone is a silicone which is used to coat the hair and is not water soluable so it creates the \'conditioning\' feel you feel when in the shower while the water is pouring over your head but once you step out of the shower it doesn\'t feel the same because it leaves a film behind which doesn\'t allow the hair to slide easily between each other.On the other hand the \'film\' Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone leaves behind is suppose to help control frizz which so far it has done well for me.I have used other Pantene daily conditioners before in the past and unless it was a treatment conditioner such as Pantene\'s \'Deep Fortifying\' conditioners then Pantene\'s daily conditioners are usually rather thin and never worked very well .If you have used Pantene\'s treatment conditioners then you have a general idea of the consistency and results of the Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner.The one thing I really did not like is the smell of this conditioner.  The perfume is much stronger with this product than with Pantene\'s other products. It\'s not over whelming but noticeable stronger than another of Pantene\'s product I currently own.I am sensitive to scents so what I feel is too much isn\'t always the case for someone else.  If you are someone who doesn\'t like a lot of perfume you may want to give this product a whiff the next time you are at a grocery store before you purchase it here from Amazon.I do not know if I will continue using this product. This is my third wash using this conditioner and so far I am happy with the results but I\'m sensitive to products which contain sulfates and with anything that leaves a film behind a strong cleaner is definitely needed to help remove build up between uses. If I notice that my non-sulfate shampoos are sufficient in cleaning between conditioning with this  than I\'ll probably stick to using this otherwise I\'ll probably return to my normal routine.In conclusion I give it a 4 stars because I believe that Pantene\'s Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works well for those battling frizzy hair and after my hair dried it was extremely soft but I don\'t care for the perfume because I feel it\'s too strong.I like to give a Pro and Con breakdown for each of my reviews so here is the list for this one.Pros1.

It has a pleasant, sweet smell that could conceivably trick people into believing it is my natural aroma, rather than the all-too-typical artificial odor of pears and alcohol (which is likely to make people think I drank too much and got into the stash of pears).In terms of functionality, this conditioner did a great job taming my somewhat frizzy hair, although it was no match for the occasionally intense humidity of DC summers.

There\'s a certain segment of the population that perceives a certain elegance, an elan, if you will (or if you won\'t), a panache and flair to products named with a bon mot. Pantene... it sounds elegant(though it has no French meaning--not that it matters) and, by the way, it works pretty darn well.That\'s the most important thing here, Pantene \'FIne Hair SOlutions Flat to Volume\' Conditioner does what it says it will do: Add s bit of of volume (or the appearance of volume) by coating your hair strands, and adding sheen by aligning them.  IT reduce tangles, does not have an unpleasant smell, and basically has a reasonable price. Yes, you can go cheaper, and you might as well give those a try.While we\'re talking about language, what\'s with the name \'Flat to Volume\' --is it an awkward shorthand for \'Your hair looks flat, see, and this stuff will give it VOLUME. Therefore, Flat to Volume!\'  IT might annoy you for a few seconds, or perhaps this is Pantenese, and I\'m the one who should know better.Pantene comes out of the bottle fairly thick, so use just a little. Spread it around your hair, and it becomes much less viscous. I\'d recommend also that you rinse thoroughly.  I thought I detected a slight allergic reaction on my part (some itching) compared to not using it, but this is a tenuous connection and may have nothing to do with the product.  However, like all beauty/cosmetic products, it\'s probably better to buy ONE of these first to determine whether you have any adverse reactions.  Bottom line: I\'d buy it again, but it didn\'t blow me away either.

I only wish the manufactuer\'s wouldn\'t keep changing the packaging -- very few retail outlets can keep up with all the variations in packaging and in the frequent changes.Robert C. Ross  2010 "

It doesn\'t seem to weigh my hair down and, the one day I took the time to blow dry it and wear it down, it stayed fairly smooth and looked about as well as it always does. Did this conditioner actually make my hair look or feel \'fuller and thicker\' well, not really, and I didn\'t really expect it to either. Did it smooth and condition my hair? Yeah, and that\'s what I expected it to do. I wouldn\'t pay extra for this conditioner (above regular Pantene prices), but I wouldn\'t hesitate to choose it again either."

I use the hairspray, shampoo, conditioner, heat protectant spray, and volumizing gel. The volumizing gel does make a great difference versus shampoo and conditioner alone. Even though I didn\'t get the results I hoped for from this product, I still use it because Pantene altogether has made my hair stronger and much healthier! Good product, affordable system. "

This new formula is much gentler. It has a gel-like consistency, which won\'t weigh hair down or make it oily as a creamy formula would. This shampoo made my hair very, very clean. So clean, in fact, that I could probably drop back to shampooing it every other day instead of every day as I normally would. I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick.As for volumizing properties, my hair didn\'t go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it\'s making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer.The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day. So if you are going to try this shampoo, you should definitely purchase the matching conditioner to keep the tangles at bay.Overall, I\'d say I am satisfied with this shampoo. It offers great cleansing, a mild floral scent, and modest volumizing properties. For those who say that it is too expensive, you can easily buy an off brand version of this at just about any grocery or superstore for about two and a half dollars a bottle. "

She seemed happy with it -- no complaints, no raving about her sudden boost in volume either.One of the selling points of this shampoo is a focus on removing oils in the hair, which weigh it down. It\'d probably pay off to make sure you\'re conditioning after using this shampoo, even if you have relatively oily hair (as I do). You\'d be surprised how quick \'volume\' can turn into \'frizz\' if you let your hair dry out. I\'m a guy and don\'t really pay much attention to my hair, but even I know that.Right now this shampoo is going for around thirty bucks for a pack of 6 bottles. Not a steal, but not a ripoff either.

I\'m very pleased with the results so far.  It provides more lift and stylability than I\'ve achieved with other shampoos. My hair is looking better than it has in a while. Since my hair isn\'t oily, I was a little concerned that the extra lift is reportedly achieved by removing oil from the hair. My hair doesn\'t look or feel dry after use, but still I thought I should add the companion conditioner just to be safe.  So far am pleased with it too.  Most conditioners make my hair hopelessly flat, but this product works well with the shampoo and doesn\'t counteract the shampoo\'s benefits.After using this shampoo, my scalp, which tends to be itchy, also feels good.  Since I use a lot of hair spray, I wonder if it is more effective at removing that residue from my scalp than other shampoos.  Don\'t know, but I do know my scalp feels better and my hair looks good.  Can\'t beat that. I\'m very pleased with this product and recommend it to others who need a boost in the hair department. "

The result:  she did not notice any difference from the \'regular\' Pantene products she was already using.  She did say that it smells nice.  Also, she mentioned that it performs as well as some more expensive \'salon\' products she has used.  And it does perform better than \'bargain\' brands like Suave.So the conclusion is that if you currently use more expensive salon products for fine hair, try this Pantene duo for similar performance at a cheaper price.  If you currently use a cheap brand of hair product, try Pantene and see if it works better for you.  Otherwise, if you are happy with your current product/price, we see no compelling reason to switch. "

So, while it might cost more per bottle, the value to me is greater with this.When I first started using this, it did seem to make my hair feel more dried out, which might just be because the Suave that I use also has a conditioner in it.  So, I now use a separate conditioner from time to time.  I took away one star for that, but if you already use a separate conditioner, then that\'s not an issue.It really does seem to give my hair more volume.

I have used every really good shampoo for fine hair for several decades, so I have many different shampoos to compare this one to.After using Pantene\'s Pro-v for a few days, I am extremely impressed with it having all the great qualities that I require from a really good fine hair shampoo. The first thing I look for is a totally clear shampoo, because if you can see through it, it\'s not going to weigh down your fine hair, and this Pantene Pro-v is perfectly crystal clear. It has a lovely, very faint light citrus smell, which I like, as I don\'t like shampoo smells to clash with my favorite fragrances. It cleans really well and leaves your fine hair full of body and lift, which is exactly what a great fine hair shampoo should do.The main difference I noticed between my shampoo and this Pantene Pro-v is that Pantene Pro-v cleans really well, as in thoroughly super clean, leaving my hair much fuller with absolutely nothing weighing it down. When your hair is that clean, it\'s very important to use a good conditioner to replace lost moisture. Fine hair needs a very special type of conditioner that will not weigh hair down and flatten it, and the best conditioner I have ever found is one that rinses out minutes after it is put on after shampooing.This is a lovely light scented shampoo that cleans extremely well and leaves your fine hair feeling light, full and bouncy.

I was so happy when Tampax started packaging their tampons this way because at different times throughout my cycle I use different sizes.  I think most women do this, and normally we\'d have to buy 3 different boxes.  This box makes it so convenient with all three sizes included.  I love the ease of use too.  Tampax is the only brand I\'ll use."

The one major thing I don\'t like is the plastic applicators as they are not green friendly. Multipacks like this one may not suit your flow, but there\'s enough of each to possibly get you through two months or so without having to pick up additional boxes."

Ok, well this is going to be a bit personal.  But what I like about these are they do easily glide in, they are not as long and weirdly shaped as regular Tampax and some other brands and they just \'fit\' better. Also, they expand properly in the width and absorb well, so I have not had any worries about leaking.  In addition, its a nice bonus that this pack comes with three different sizes to use as your flow changes. These are unscented- perfect for those of us who don\'t like those flowery perfumed scents. These are a tad pricey, but worth the cost in my opinion and I will deifnitely continue to use these."

I normally go with the normal Tampax, not the Pearl line. There are a few \'upgrades\' with the Pearl line, in addition to the quality and protection you know and trust from Tampax.Instead of the traditional paper wrap, these are in an easy to open plastic wrap. Tampax calls these purse-friendly, and indeed they are. We\'ve all found that torn open, slightly disassembled tampon at the bottom of our purse. You won\'t have that problem with the Pearl line. The multi-pack, for me, always runs out of mediums and leaves me with only the barely useful light and the super absorbency is just scary big.The blunt cardboard applicator has been replaced with a \'smooth plastic applicator and rounded tip for comfortable insertion\'. I won\'t say you can\'t tell the difference, but chances are you won\'t care. The difference is so insignificant that I don\'t find it worth the additional cost, both financially and to the environment. That is pretty much the story of the Pearl line. Like with the absorbent braid, I don\'t koow that the ever so slight amount of additional protection will ever, in your life, make even the slightest difference.The Pearl line, like the normal Tampax line, is great. For me, I\'ll stick with the less expensive, paper wrapped, cardboard applicators. BUT, if the added feature seem like they would make a difference to you, then go for Pearl."

I love the smooth plastic applicator but I too had a problem with these staying put.  I guess they are too smooth for me.  I have a heavy flow the first few days so I tried the super size first.  I had to wear a pad with it to contain the leaks.  I recently tried the OB brand super size and they are perfect for my heavy flow days.  They do not fall out and they contain the leaks like no other.  I did use this multipack for my lighter days and got by with just a pantiliner but I can not get past having them fall out when I go to relieve myself.  I do not like having tampons in my septic system and I do not want to have to fish them out.  I have had two children so maybe these would have worked better prior to childbirth.

However, these tampons just didn\'t say put. It\'s likely they are too small for me (insert crass joke here). I am 35 but have not had a child. I used the \'Super\' ones (which are the biggest in this pack) and within an hour or so, they had just kinda worked their way out. Since the \'Super\' ones weren\'t cutting it, I know there\'s no way I can even try the smaller ones. Sadly, this box will be a waste for me.I do like the plastic applicator however. Packaging on this item is great."

So, when I saw that Tampax was offering a similar product, I decided to try it.  I find both products protect equally well (anyway, they are all limited by regulations on how absorbant they can be due to that Rely scare years ago), so it really comes down to price and convenience.  This box has a good assortment with 10 lites, 10 super and the largest portion of regulars - which will probably suit most women.  The price via the Amazon Subscribe and Save is very reasonable (and much cheaper than my grocery store), and definitely convenient being delivered right to your door.  I don\'t have to worry about running out, and for some women who are uncomfortable buying them in stores this is a great alternative.Overall, a good reiable product from a reputable brand at a reasonable price.  Recommended."

I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."

I had no problem with the performance of the tampon (although it was a bit more difficult to use), but I\'m quite bothered by the production and disposal of this product.  It feels so wasteful to use plastic so briefly and then toss it in the trash.  The plastic is made from oil, which keeps us dependent on other countries and pollutes the air, and then it lingers on in landfills or floats out to sea.  It was recently reported that whale carcasses washing up on California\'s beaches had plastic tampon applicators in their stomachs, among other debris.No, I think Tampax would do better to improve upon their cardboard applicators which at least can be sourced from recycled paperboard or from sustainably managed forests.  Or perhaps I\'ll forgo the applicator all together and just use o.b. tampons."

No reviews yet?- I really like this applicator. Since it\'s a \'pearl\'-like plastic, it slides in easily and comfortably. I also find that it\'s easy to grip the tip while pushing the tampon in. With other brands, I can\'t get a good grip and just end up pushing the whole darn thing in.- Regular is the way to go, I find; I don\'t like the bulk of bigger tampons.- I feel more comfortable with unscented products. Granted, I\'ve never tried a scented one, but... I don\'t think there should be any perfuming going on down there.So yup.  I\'m pretty loyal to these. Available pretty much everywhere, fortunately."

The plastic makes them easier to insert (also buy her some lubricant and have her stand up with her foot up on the toilet or even higher ).  The \'lip\' at the edge of the tampon makes it easier to grip as well. The LITES are smaller and easier for a young girl to use. The small size and individual wrapping makes them easy to put in a pocket.Use your own judgement to make sure that she is mature enough to remember to remove them at regular intervals.  But if she participates in sports/swimming/dance having this option is invaluable so that she can participate in her normal activities.

The leak guard is SO irritating!!! I have thrown out two boxes and bought playtex. Someone didn\'t do their research.

I don\'t know why other reviewers are saying that they take some \'getting used to\' ... they are EXACTLY like any other tampon except that they\'re stored \'in half\', so to speak - the tampon half inside of the applicator half - for greater discretion. Once you click them open (which takes about one second - if you can click a ballpoint pen, you can do this) they are exactly like every other tampon, and you just insert them as normal.Another great thing about these tampons is the packaging. The external package (the part that says \'Tampax Compak Pearl\') contains four boxes of 10 tampons each: one purple box of 10 lites, two yellow boxes of 10 regulars, and one green box of 10 supers. The color-coded boxes are very discreet; they are just pretty patterns with no words printed on them at all. Very nice for when you want to store some tampons in your desk at work, in your locker at school, or in your boyfriend\'s bathroom. ;)"

What I have learned and was hoping to find info on before purchasing: They come with the applicator stick already in the tube and per instructions you have to pull it out till it clicks and then when inserting push it back in until it clicks. Great idea for making them take up less room and not get ruined in your pocket or purse. They are a little more flimsy then the regular ones so you have to be careful. Also, the first one the stick fell into the toilet. I have been careful with the rest, strategically holding them, but the rest have not really seemed as loose so it might have just been a fluke thing. They take a little getting used to and I haven\'t seen them in super plus yet, but I will continue to use them when I don\'t need the plus."
