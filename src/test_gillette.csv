The Mach III is the first time I felt like I could shave rather absent-mindedly (it is first thing in the morning, after all) and not endanger my face.The issue is that the Mach III has been surpassed by the so-called \'Mach III Turbo\' product release from Gillette.  The naming of that product is unfortunate - \'Turbo\' sounds like some marketing affectation, when in fact it honestly provides you with a vastly superior shaving experience.  Despite the rather obscene price point of the Turbo, I\'d suggest you skip the \'Mach III\' and move up.  I\'m convinced you can get more shaves out of it and make your money back.

65,68,20110909,B000052YIN,3,"September 9, 2011",A3WAQEX5H4F3A,A perspective from someone who prefers shaving gel...,"I made the mistake of purchasing this product, and meant to get the Gillette Series gel.  I didn\'t know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too.  Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!).  I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I\'ve used in the past.  However, as other reviewers have noted, it\'s not as \'rich\' or full-bodied when it comes out of the can.  The \'instructions\' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams).  Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it\'s good foam, and I\'d give it a higher rating if it wasn\'t for the \'watery\' consistency when it comes out of the can.  This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).In summary:* If you like foam, you may like this one.  3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won\'t like it.  However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you\'d like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The slim head is much more manageable than the oversized wall of blades of the Mach 3 (which feels like you are just wiping your face with blades, instead of using a razor).

Suddenly, the blades you have been using for years are duller and don\'t hold their edge as well.  You move up to the newer shaving system to get back to the old comfort level, at a higher price.  Then, the cycle eventually repeats itself.

I will tell you why:1) The fusion has such a big head that there are some places that it simply can not go, I know that it has the blade on the back for those hard to reach places but that is only one blade - the Mach 3\'s head is much smaller and can get the whole head in those hard places.2)  Cost - why pay more gilette seems to think we want to pay more.3) Wilkerson Corp said it best when the company said \'the simple addition of one blade does not necessarily make for a better shave.\'  Only if things in life were that simple.Had Gilette not sent me the free Mach 3 I would have probably never known about it and stayed with the more expensive model.

438,448,20080805,B000277P5E,5,"August 5, 2008",A29WWNOYAM96QB,Real Mach3 Turbo razor blades are great! BUT Watch out for fakes!,"First, I want to explain that I gave 5-stars because this is a product review and this product is excellent as a razor blade. HOWEVER, be careful where you buy it from, some sellers especially on ebay and amazon (third parties) are selling FAKE blades. It\'s hard to recognize at first but you can tell from a few things:1. If you are familiar with Gillette shave, you will feel the difference immediately. For example, my one-month old genuine Gillette razor still shaves better than a fake one.2. Lubricating strip on the fake one is not real. So, how do you know it? With real Gillette product you can immediately feel there is a lot of lubricant (a little sticky moisture feeling), BUT with the fake one, your face will feel very dry even when you used the blades for the first time. Because they are not lubricating! They are fake strips and made out of some plastic kind material.3. Even after many months of use, If you try to remove lubricating strip on your real Gillette product, you can see that there is still a lot of lubricant just under the strip and on the strip itself. And this strip is a one piece well-aligned strip, easy to remove and easy to put back. BUT, if you remove the fake one\'s strip, this just plastic kind strip will break into parts and you cannot put it back in place.4. If you have a good eye, look closely to see if all three blades are leveled and adjusted as parallel to each other. Usually, on the fake ones, you will see a slight misalignment, basically they are out of line and think about it, what it can do to your face. Check all the blades in the box individually. None of them should be misaligned.5. Look closely to see small black dots on the blades. Original Mach3 blades have a little larger dots and their paint does not feel as precise as the fake ones. This is because, real ones have an almost invisible clear coat but you can see it if you look at the black dots directly.6. Look at the blue plastic strip just under the blades, now try to abuse them with the tip of your fingernails (Be careful do not cut your fingers).They are many micro-aligned plastic lines, and When you do this, they re-align themselves immediately without no damage to themselves. BUT on fake ones, they try to align back, but they can\'t! They always leave marks on abused spots on them.7. Look at the front side of blades. Just under the moving head, you will see five parallel lines on the plastic stable part. On the real one the line in the middle is slightly thicker than other ones. But on the fake one they may show difference. And the fake ones, usually (not always) a little darker in color of plastic, if you have good eyes.8. Now a little flexibility test. You know Mach3s has flexible heads. Fake ones, too... However, if you move the head with your finger to the back, it should come back to the original place with a smooth movement. On the fake ones, they come back but they come back quicker than the real ones. And fake ones even make a slight plastic sound when coming back.9. Look at the plastic cartridge holder if it has serial number printed on it. If so, it still DOESN\'T mean they are real. Nowadays, they are putting serial numbers on fake ones, too. So, follow the first 8 steps, to make sure you have the real ones.Nowadays, fakes are so close to real, I hope this review helps to all of you. I know some of the sellers who sell fake ones will find this review not useful. BUT using genuine razors is a health issue so be careful. And always buy from reliable sellers. Amazon itself is very reliable but be careful with other third party sellers. Read their reviews first!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had been using the Mach 3 and Gillette 3 blade disposible (along with Edge Ultra-sensitive gel), but noticed more and more razor bumps. It got so bad, that I had to take the day off from work because I couldn\'t show my totally raw/cut/irritated face.  Needless to say, my skin is sensitive.Well, I didn\'t shave for 2 days trying to baby my skin so it would recover.  The next day, I had to shave so I had to make a decisionAs with most cases, when I need something answered, or need other people\'s opinions, I fired up the good ol\' web browser.  I started by researching electric razors since I heard they were easier on your face, but after reading the reviews, I couldn\'t see spending $150 for something that may not even help and probably wouldn\'t give me as close a shave.I had heard of the Fusion and it did sound interesting to me.  The 5 blade feature didn\'t impress me as much as the fact that the blades are closer together.  I figured if they\'re closer it wouldn\'t give my skin the chance to get between them and be sliced off - excuse my graphic language :) I looked up reviews on the Fusion and found some mention of it being good for sensitive skin.  That did it for me, so off I went to buy a Fusion.When I got to the store, their were rows and rows of empty racks (I would guess at least 20 rows) where all the Fusions had been.  Seems like they\'re very popular with the local crowd.  Anyhow there was ONE left and I nabbed it.Got it home and immediately went in to shave.What a difference!  No razor new razor bumps, and it didn\'t even irritate the old ones (from my Gillette disposables).  No cuts, no irritation whatsoever!  And it really gives you a smooth shave.  Even my wife was impressed with my smooth face!So, moral to this story.  If you have sensitive skin, and you want a really close shave with no irritation, get the Fusion.  And yes I agree, the cartridges are pretty expensive, but to me my face is worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a tough beard and sensitive skin. A bad combination. I bought the Fusion on a whim. I didn\'t expect it to be signficantly better than the previous generation Mach 3 but hope springs eternal. After two weeks and 7-8 shaves with the same cartridge(!), I can wholeheartedly say that this is a very noticeable improvement over the Mach 3. The cartridges have an astounding life. The Mach 3 would give me about 3-4 shaves before the blades dulled enough to result in razor rash. The Fusion has at least doubled that and is still going strong. Amazing. The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if Gillette is using a higher quality steel in the blades for the product launch. Time will tell. Secondly, I get far less razor burn from the Fusion. Almost none actually. Lastly, it\'s more difficult to cut myself in the nose/lip area which was something I had to watch carefully with the Mach 3. I\'d guess this has to do with a larger blade surface area. In short, the Fusion really is an improvement over the Mach 3. As long as the cartridges continue to last for 8-10 shaves each, I will be a loyal customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shaving\'s about as pleasurable as a molten lava enema.  Fortunately, the right products can make it a little more bearable.  I\'ve never anticipated the release of a shaving product of any kind before, but this razor got me really intrigued.  Could this be the razor that conquers my impossible face (and wallet) once and for all?Gillette have been the masters of shaving comfort for several years now.  Their introduction of the Mach 3 razor was a breakthrough, just like they said.  A lot of you likely still use the Mach 3, but it\'s a good bet the Fusion will make you want to upgrade.I\'ll admit, I was a little wary about using a five-bladed razor.  I felt the same way about the Mach 3; I envisioned pressing too hard and slicing into my jugular, or worse, going to work with an entire roll of toilet paper on my face.  Thankfully, the opposite happened, and I used the Mach 3 and M3 Turbo for years.  I even bought into the M3 Power when it came out, but found there wasn\'t much difference in closeness or comfort (which is why I chose the manual Fusion over the Fusion Power).  Still a really good shave, though.Anyway, about the Fusion.  First off, don\'t be intimidated by the five blades.  They\'re close enough together that you really have to try to cut yourself.  In fact, that\'s one of the beauties of this razor.  Even a face like mine, which is very susceptible to cuts, accepted the Fusion\'s blades with very little irritation.  The first couple of times I used it, I had to watch out for pressing too hard and suffered a couple minor nicks, but I quickly got the hang of it.  The blades really do all the work.  The head of the razor is bigger than the M3 as well, which actually does cut down on shaving time.I\'ve always liked the \'indicator\' strip on the top of the M3 blade that lets me know when it\'s time to change the blade, and it\'s here on the Fusion as well.  It\'s made with aloe, if you\'re interested in that sort of thing, which supposedly aids in shaving comfort.  You\'ll get about a week\'s worth of good shaves before the blade wears out, which works out to a pack of cartridges a month (about the same as the M3).  It\'s best to pick these up in bulk (packs of 8); if and when you switch to this razor, you\'ll need them anyway, and you\'ll save a little dough in the process.The extra blade on the back of the razor is rather neat indeed.  It does help even out your sideburns and touches up those tricky spots right under your nose and above your chin.  I wouldn\'t use it for beard sculpting or anything, but for tough areas it does a good job.  Just be mindful of that blade when you\'re shaving near your ears.  I accidentally nicked my earlobe shaving my jawline the first time I used it. Yeowch!Changing the blade out is just as easy as the M3 also.  Just pop, slide, and click a new blade in.The \'comfort guard\' under the main blades is a slight improvement from the M3, but it\'s not really a \'wow\' factor.  The \'ergonomic\' handle is pure gimmick; it does little more than make the Fusion look like a phaser from Star Trek.  I would rather just buy the blades and have them fit on my Mach 3, but what kind of marketing savvy would that be?  Oh well; the razor itself isn\'t exactly a bank-breaker, and you only have to buy it once.All told, this is the Porsche 911 of razors.  It\'s a smooth ride, it\'s comfortable, it\'s fast, and yes, even though the blades are pricey, it\'s worth it to me.  If I had my druthers, of course, I\'d use an electric (they\'re much less expensive in the long run), but they\'re just not compatible with my face and Rocky Mountain-ish peaks and valleys of my neck.  (Believe me; I\'ve tried five different kinds.)  The Fusion\'s the closest shave I\'ve gotten with a blade yet.  If you really saw the difference between the M3 and M3 Power on your face, you\'ll probably notice it with the Fusion Power as well, but I figure I\'m paying enough for the one without the motor.I\'m glad I made the switch, and after comparing with the Mach 3, I won\'t go back.  Try it and see for yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shave is close, smooth and free from razor burn. The lack of razor burn is remarkable with a new blade.But the extra single-blade is another matter altogether.  Because the main 5-blade setup is so big, some provision had to be made for tight spots like under the nose.  It\'s an old-fashioned single blade. I really don\'t remember when I last used a single blade.  I think that\'s why I dislike shaving. Oww, yes, it\'s that old-time razor burn in spades.So after any shave you can contrast the burn beneath your nose with the smooth, closely-shaved, unharmed skin on the rest of your face.After their big-buck R & D efforts, Gillette needs a way to solve this.(Or use a Mach III under your nose and the new Fusion  on the rest of your beard.)BTW, somehow they seem to have solved the clogged-blade problem that haunted the 4-bladed Shick Quattro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whenever these shaving companies come out with these number-of-blade toppers, the inevitable question asked is \'where will it end?\'  I think the BladeMask comment answers that question in a facetious but, hey who knows, perhaps accurate way.  Touch&eacute;.I\'ve always been a (very) early adopter of Gillette blade innovations, so I bought the Fusion first day of release.  [ Hey, A.G. Lafley bought the whole freakin\' company after testing a Fusion prototype, so that\'s a pretty good testament.]In terms of the Fusion itself, there are pros and cons vs. upgrading from the Mach Turbo 3.The pros:- Does seem to be a better shave (certainly takes less strokes, that\'s for sure).  Gillette has succeeded in raising the bar again.- I suspect you\'ll get less wear on each blade meaning you\'ll be able to keep the blade in the razor longer.  [A key point when you  read my \'cons\'.]- The industrial design of the razor, the blade and how the two pieces fit together is a thing of beauty.  A real indication of the increasing pervasiveness of CAD in every aspect of our lives and the need to compete on functionality, price AND design.  [Thank you, Steve Jobs.]- The blade on the back is a real breakthrough.  Sounds bizarre in concept, but great in practice.  You\'ll keep your sideburns straighter and not bang up that space under your nose trying to cram 3+ blades under there.The cons:- Well, of course you need that backside razor because the darn surface face of the blade contraption is so big (this is the \'Big Bertha\' of razors) and spongy-flexible like a teenage gymnast that you can\'t get the shaving impact area within a country mile of the undersize of your nose.  The backside razor isn\'t just a coolness factor; it was birthed out of necessity.- Gillette has now taken its famed \'give way the razor to get the blade revenue\' business model (and the mother of all business analogies) to a price-gouging extreme.  $25 for eight blades? (and that\'s the discount).  What will happen is that shaver across the world will look for a way to extend the life of each blade.  Gillette famously doesn\'t recommend when to change blades  leaving the decision to each shaver (and, hey - Richard Nixon and I had different shaving needs, so how could they possibly recommend a standard).  But - my reaction will be to double the tenure of each blade I put in play.  I think others will consider the same practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First off, great design from the shape of the handle etc to the holder itself. If you like cool industrial design for the masses (think Michael Graves and so on at Target) then this will make you happy. It\'s also an impressive piece of manufacturing, that they can get the five blades lined up with such accuracy. Extra points for the design geeks.More importantly of course, the shaving experience itself. I live in Minnesota which right now (winter) has quite a dry climate, so a harsh shave will leave you with raw, uncomfortable skin for most of the day. I\'m not sure if this razor gave a closer shave than with my Mach 3, but it certainly was way quicker and required fewer re-strokes, which cuts down on irritation and the potential for nicks and cuts. It was easy to shave the hard-to-manage parts of my face where the hairs aren\'t all lying in the same direction, like under my jaw, which again cut down on the number of re-strokes. Once I got used to the extra razor on the back of the cartridge, I liked the way I could use it as advertised: for near my nose, round my goatee etc.I have to admit that I thought five blades sounded ridiculous, but it does seem to work just as stated in the manufacturer\'s blurb.UPDATE: Now had this for about two weeks, and I\'m continuing to be happy with it. I\'ve noticed a lot fewer problems with ingrown hairs and little nicks and cuts.

I\'m done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave.  Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other \'detail\' parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front.  It just doesn\'t work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it\'s hard to continue shaving when there\'s hair worsening the blades\' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick. Whatever the case, I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

516,526,20091012,B000BUUVTE,5,"October 12, 2009",A3OYO3Z2CHIHFS,Pinnacle of Manual Shaving,What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It\'s now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it\'s thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can\'t be improved.  It\'s just that good.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

When I started using Mach3, I thought this was the best shaving experience I'd ever get. And then Fusion proved me how wrong I was. Shaving becomes just too damn easy and smooth with Fusion - GO FOR IT!!!

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

Then along came the Fusion (5 blades). And honestly, the shave from this one is better. I never thought that possible. You can hardly feel the blades just glide across your face.

I usually let my facial hair go for a few days and then shave. The system worked great with the Mach 3 but I decided to ...upgrade. Big mistake, this thing is like shaving with a dull saw.

1650,550,20071210,B000BUUVTE,4,"December 10, 2007",A3LMEZZJ7ZGAMB,"Razor Bumps, Ingrown Hairs, Do You Hate Shaving?  Not Anymore","For as long as I can remember, shaving has been a dreaded event. I always got razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and my facial hair isn\'t even curly. I have tried everything from electric razors, to clippers, to double edge safety razors, and even changing the directions that I shaved. Nothing has ever really worked.  I received a free fusion in the mail, and was skeptical. I tried it, but I still got razor bumps. But then I thought for a second about shaving WITH the grain and NOT stretching the skin, and thought even more about using a shaving brush that I had purchased. I also decided to use a simple, cheap shaving cream, Barbasol Aloe Shaving Cream that I already had in my closet. I found the SOLUTION!  But I should also mention that I shave in the shower with a mirror. I now look forward to shaving, and I feel that shaving everyday is best because it allows your face to grow accustomed to shaving, also allowing the hairs on your face to grow in the direction that you shave, remember-WITH the grain. If you shave with the grain you greatly reduce your chances of having ingrown hairs. If you want to love shaving, and be like that guy who has a perfect shave, get yourself a gilette fusion, a shaving brush, a shower mirror, and a mug. Shave in the shower:Let your face get wet with hot water for at least 2 mins, put some shaving cream on a brush and stretch your skin out (only while brushing)  and brush your beard for 2 mins, fill your mug with hot water and dip your razor in the mug every couple of strokes. Shave in the direction of hair growth, never against and don\'t stretch it, if anything puff up your face! I make two passes, after the first one I re-lather and fill my mug up again with more hot water. And you don\'t need to leave the water on!!! That\'s what the mug is for. Try this for a few days and tell me, someone who has suffered for 7 years, that it isn\'t the best shave you ever had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had been using the Sensor Excel since it came out- I tried the Mach3 when it came out and was disappointed, so I stuck with the Excel.  I tried both the Fusion Power and the manual Fusion.  I liked the manual Fusion better than the power version.  I did the half-face comparison on the Excel and the Fusion for a week.  It was close with occasional nicks from the Excel, never from the Fusion.  The Fusion WINS!  I now use only the Fusion with Aveeno Positively Smooth shave gel and a shower mirror in the shower - The best combination for a shave at any price.  The downside is that the Fusion blades are inexcusably pricey, but they last seven shaves or more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the powered Fusion the manual one allows for incredible flexibility and a truly close but comfortable shave. In retrospect, my problem with the powered version is that the \'micropulses\' take away your control and the vibrations will cause you to press harder on your skin (leading to nicks, cuts and razor burn). I\'ve been using the manual Fusion razor for almost two weeks now and am so impressed that I\'ve stopped using the Schick Quattro Midnight altogether.

It is expensive compared to twin-blade razors, but the five-blade shaving heads last longer.  The blades are available from a variety of sources ranging from local supermarkets and drugstores to Internet sources, so shop around for the best price.I found that this razor gives a smoother shave than the older twin-blade razors, and the flat five-blade surface has less tendency to cause nicks.  The trimmer blade on the back side is convenient - something that was missing on the twin-blade razors.It is worth spending a few bucks to give it a try.

This is a recent problem, but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors.  The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face.

1662,562,20061216,B000BUUVTE,4,"December 16, 2006",A5C1ZTRQ2KWM7,Better Shave; More work to get it.,"Pros:Handle is weighted well.Very close shave.Less irritation than previous generations, even against grain.Extra blade on back=worth it.Cons:5 blades get gunked up quickly, requiring more passes.Long surface area (of blade) takes some getting used to.Expensive; not compatible with Mach3 system.Update:Down to 2-3 Stars.Used the razor for about two weeks and found that it did not function as well as the Mach3. If you are not an everyday shaver (sometimes I don\'t shave on the weekends or holiday breaks) you will suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth of growth. Also, I found that I simply wasn\'t getting as close a shave as I did with the Mach3, even when shaving every day. I agree that there was less irritation, but only slightly so.

Thus the beginner tag. I stopped using a bladed razor because of cuts. For years I kind of accepted an average shave from electric razors because I just knew a blade would cut my face. I even grew a goatee because I could not get a clean shave on my chin. About two weeks ago I received an unsolicited free Gillette Fusion in the mail. I just sat it on my desk and figured I would toss it out eventually. Something inside told me to \'research\' it on the Net. I did and decided to give it a whack come Monday morning (Nov. 6). After perusing these reviews I decided to not buy the Fusion gels. I instead bought the Face Scrub, Shaving Gel and Post Shave Lotion of the Neutrogena Men, Razor Defense line. Let\'s just say I did not know I needed a Face Scrub product. :-)With some trepedition I went ahead with my \'test.\' I could not believe how gently the Fusion glided across my face. And, just as importantly, what an improvement over my electric razor. I honestly do not think I could cut myself if I tried. Okay, of course I could. :-)I recommend this razor. I have not used Mach3, Sensor, etc. so I can\'t say it is better or worse. But I like it.P.S. The cartridges are, of course, overpriced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the plus side it really hugs your face, shaves cleanly with a single pass, and doesn\'t nick or abrade the skin. Even the edges under the jaw line came clean. I hate shaving and often skip weekends yet find that it works quite well on one, two, or even three day\'s worth of growth. Haven\'t gone longer than that so I couldn\'t say for sure but seems like it\'d do okay for another day or two. Any longer and it would take a pass with an electric trimmer to shorten things up first. The handle is nicely ergonomic too, easy to grip and control when wet. On the minus side the single trim blade doesn\'t work horribly well, at least not for me. I\'ve got to even up my sideburns and trim around my goatee and this just doesn\'t do the trick. Considering what they cost, the blades don\'t last as long as I\'d like either. I\'ve used it regularly for about three weeks and it\'s just starting to dull enough to consider changing the blade. Might be able to stretch it another week but that might be pushing it. Considering that I can go a year with an electric model (Braun) on a single blade/screen set I\'d think they could make a manual that lasts more than a month...Despite the downside, it\'s the best manual razor I\'ve used so far. Quick, clean, comfortable shave... Got one as a free promotion and liked it enough to pick up a pack of refill cartridges. They are a bit pricey but not overmuch.

I have to admit, there I was standing in the shower looking at this thing and thinking \'I think I can pick up a squadron of German bombers coming in\'. Seriously, it looks like a WW2 coastal radar, not a razor. I mean it is big.. huge..ridiculous. I pictured the coroner finding my severed head in the shower, this thing clutched in my hands, \'air raid\' scrawled on the shower in blood. I have to admit- it is arguably the best shave I have ever had. I shave my head as well and I half expected it to look like a bowl of coleslaw when done but nary a nick at all. I found that due to it\'s size it did need fixing on a curve or two, but overall I was very impressed. I have been using Gillette disposable up till now. So it has impressed my skin, but now it has to make peace with my wallet. It all boils down to how long the blades last. I expect at least a week out of each. Usually those green \'lube\' strips are the first to go and after that the razors become pretty brutal. AT this price point I don\'t want to use more than one blade every week. If  they can manage that and send me some coupons then I am sold. But I think 5 blades is the stopping point- anything beyond that needs a pull starter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1673,573,20060521,B000BUUVTE,1,"May 21, 2006",A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,This is a terrible razor... a BIG step backwards.,"I began using Gillette\'s Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...)  The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves.  That was an excellent product.  However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model.  I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be.  I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none.  I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal?  Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product?  That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one?  If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off.  I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it.  So much for my customer loyalty.  I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They very cleverly use terms like \'a better way to shave\' or \'30% closer blades\', and there is a reason for this. The reality is that very little (if any) improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems. And Gillette knows this through their own internal research. Their studies show that customers can\'t discern the difference between 3-blade and Fusion systems. It is all just perception. However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems. The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.Here is another interesting tidbit you probably didn\'t know about all of this. Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements. Well there is a reason for this too. The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer. Gillette doesn\'t want folks to get a bad first impression. As you probably know, they don\'t make money on the razors. The real money is with the replacement blades. And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.With the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option. So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested. The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power. That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you\'ve ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your  shaver), you\'ll come to appreciate that gillette\'s blades can last a very long time. The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful. I\'d like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can\'t without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution. That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.Gillette probably hates customers like me. I use a cartridge for up to 6 months without replacement. Partly because I don\'t shave everyday (when you have a beard, skip a day and it\'s not really obvious). I\'m still on the first cartridge so I can\'t tell how dull it\'s become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it\'s 4 months now).

After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn\'t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades?

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These blades are expensive, but if I didn\'t have to change them as often, it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills. The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.I purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out. What the heck? After about a week the replacement blade was dull. I went through the 4 pack in about a month and bought a second pack at another retailer. Same thing. One week=1 blade.Gillette must really think we\'re stupid. Give the suckers a free sample that\'s great and make them pay for crummy blades after they\'ve committed to the system. Never again, Gillette.....I just ordered a Braun cordless from Amazon so you can just go pick someones else\'s pocket.Edited: Any suckers our there still letting Gillette rip them off? Yeah, I guess so since they\'re still in business. The Braun electric I mention above has recently been relegated to backup status to my Merkur double edge razor. Yep, one of those things like my dad used and that I learned to shave with. Blades cost about 7 cents each in bulk and last about a week.

I have always been a Gillette Razor user since I started to shave over 25 years ago. I have sensitive skin on my face and neck so shaving is a difficult process for me. My job prohibits beards so I need to shave every 2 days. With razors I have used in the past, with a 2 day growth,  my beard wasn\'t long enough to soften the stubble so it\'s like shaving sand paper. This always resulted in razor burns, nicks and cuts. Sometimes I looked like a victim of a masacre. My last razor was the Mach 3 Turbo. Very good razor but still got some nicks and cuts. Then I saw the commercial for the Fusion razor with 5 blades. My first thought was \'gimmick\' It will be just like any other razor, so I was reluctant to buy it. Eventually after seeing the commercials over and over again they stated with 5 blades there is less friction on your face and it will reduce problems, I broke down and bought one- the power version. The first time I used it I had\'nt shaved for a few days so I had pretty thick growth. The razor was incredible. It hugs your face like no other razor I have ever used. Even on the curves. It feels like it\'s sticking to your skin. When I was finished, not one nick or cut, and no burning sensation. It was the closest shave I ever got. My face felt as smooth as silk. The real test would be 2 days later with a minimal beard growth. That\'s where most of my problems occur. So here I was looking in the mirror with shaving cream on my face and the razor in my hand. I turned it on and went to work. To my surprise and delight it performed with flying colors. No nicks, cuts or burns!! At last a razor that lives up to the hype! I am sold and will use it until Gillette comes out with a 10 blade version! hehehe. Please remember, everybody\'s face, skin, and beard texture is different so you may not get the same results as I did. The blades are very expensive but last a little longer than the Mach 3 blades. However for the shave I got, I\'ll pay it. The one thing that takes a little getting used to is the single blade up on top. Great for shaving  under your nose or marking a sideburn line but takes some practice to use it. I cut the bottom of my nose with it the first time but have gotten the hang of it. All I can say is give this razor a try. If you don\'t like it you can always go back to your old one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nice Shaver!,"If you suffer from folliculitis, this may just be the razor you were waiting for! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.Also, I bought the Power model but am not sure yet which mode I like best: power or manual. But since you can choose whether or not to turn the power on or not, buying the power model seems best to me. You can get the best of both worlds!In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it!

So when I bought this razor with its promises, I found myself waking up excited to see if the shaver was really a cut above the rest.I\'ve never used one of these battery razors but had wanted to.  The 5 blades scared me a bit too....ouch, would that really hurt!  To my surprise, and delight....the thing ROCKS!It does give a smooth shave and seems to save me time...to my surprise.  Like others have mentioned, it is a bit bigger so a bit tougher to get under the nose....but it\'s doable.  The extra edge blade on the top is kind of cool...but I have only used it a few times.I think the three things that make this work are (1), battery vibration, (2) part under the blade that hits your skin first before the blades do....seems to lift the beard so blades cut better and, (3) five blades...5 makes a difference but the big difference is the closeness of the blades.  It seems this closeness makes it less likely that the blades cut me.  I seem to get less razor cuts.The only drawback I can see is the cost...I have had a hard time justifying the cost of razors in the past...seem too expensive, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.I highly recommend you try it.

I have pretty thick facial hair, though it is not especially fast-growing (no big problems with five o\'clock shadow and I only shave every two or three days - though on day three, I\'m pretty grizzled). The Fusion gave me the closest shave ever - especially on my neck around the Adam\'s apple, which is an always-difficult area. I usually find a few stray stubbles, even with my Mach3 Power that I\'ve been happily using for quite some time, but today my neck was smooth and clean with no \'re-do\'.The five blades of the Fusion are closer together and thus occupy about the same amount of space as the three blades of the Mach 3.  This results in a very smooth feel to the shave - you don\'t feel the five separate blades, just one shaving surface.  I did feel some tugging on the heaviest parts of my beard (I hadn\'t shaved since Sunday morning).I also found I didn\'t need to go back to \'re-shave\' certain areas.  My facial hair is pretty dense and there are certain spots on my upper cheeks, directly under my jaw and on my neck that I tend to miss or just don\'t get a close shave on the first go-round.  This wasn\'t a problem with the Fusion.The extra sixth blade works exactly as described and is a fantastic addition.  I was able to easily (and accurately) straighten out my sideburns and get those few stray and hard-to-get-at hairs under and next to my nose.Overall, I\'m very impressed.  I recognize that there is a certain amount of hype surrounding new introductions from Gillette - but it seems like they really do their homework.  When they first came out with Mach3 Power, it seemed like a gimmick - but I found it gave me a closer and more comfortable shave.

The only difference I can see is the color. Oh I\'m sure Gillette spent big bucks to make the fusion power blades stand up to the imense stress and vibrations that occurs during the blades one week lifespan.Most likely they just think people are stupid enough to either want the color coordinated ones or that customers will think something bad will happen if you use the non-power version blades. Or people will think the power ones are better.  Bottom line: Gillette thinks you are gullible. Buy the non-power blades.The overall shave is good if you shave everyday.

But with my ever increasing stubble, I wanted to find an alternative.I found this one at Kroeger and decided to give it a try. I was very impressed with the shave, it was very smooth and much more comfortable than any two blade razor. What was most impressive was it cut far less than the other razors. The turbo option doesnt really improve the shaving experience though and so I shave without the turbo power. I do have to shave on the same spots again but I do not feel any discomfort as compared to the other razors. The trimming blade too is useful especially when working on the sideburns and underneath the neck, but it takes some time to figure out the \'correct\' way of holding the handle in this position.But alas, all good things have a price and this one might be too expensive in the long run. I will have to see how many shaves my blades last to get the economics right.In short, if you are still stuck with two blades and want to move to better options, I highly recommend this razor if you can afford the blades in the long run.

I\'ve been shaving with it almost everyday starting January 27th. It is a totally new shaving experience! The razor glides over your face easier than any razor I\'ve ever used, and there is less...almost no...irritation. The time it takes me to shave has not been significantly reduced, but it has helped some and I do like the less irritation that it provides.I\'ve found the new razor lasts me 5 to 7 days of shaving before it wears out. However, the blue strip does wear out after about 4 days, but I continue to use it for a few more. I had used the Mach 3 Power razor for several years and the new Fusion Power is the best shave yet. I had similar results with the Mach 3 blades lasting about 5 to 7 shaves.I usually let me face have a rest on the weekend from all the shaving during the week, and I haven\'t stopped that tradition. For the past two weekends I skipped a day and shaved on Sunday or Monday morning.The razor has had no problems shaving through two days of growth. I have thick stubble by day two and the shave is as good as ever. The razor doesn\'t get clogged and can be cleaned out easily.I\'m getting use to the new precision trimmer on the back of the razor to shave under my nose and side-burns. I\'m more impressed with the results than I was on day one, but not as I am with my old Sensor razor, which is what I still find myself using for those hard-to-reach areas.I\'ve been using Gillette products for 17 years. I started with the Sensor and have bought and used every razor Gillette has made since! I have \'em all!The price is high, I\'ll admit it! But I think I\'m going to stick with the New Power Fusion for now. I still have some of the Mach 3 Power blades I need to use so once those are gone, I\'ll be strictly using the Fusion Power Razor.One other thing to consider is the kind of shaving cream or gel you use. I\'ve noticed that the better, \'more expensive\' ones provide a better feeling during and after a shave. I currently use Gillette\'s Shaving Gel, but I want to try the new Fusion Hydra Gel. I also want to try the King of Shaves gel. I\'ve also found the Neturogena razor defense post shave lotion to be a great product!Ultimately, the razor looks good and feels good in your hand.

Cynics of course would find it hard to eulogise over what was obviously just another fad and a rip off.  10 years later the Mach 3 is still VERY highly regarded and widely used even with the coming of the might Fusion Power with a whole two more blades and a built in vibrator to pleasure you even further.I thought I\'d experiment with the Quattro a few years back and I thought it was an improvement on the Mach 3.  I just liked the way it felt and shaved although it didn\'t shave any better than the Mach 3.  I did have one irritation though as it clogged up quite often and it was hard to get clean.  I even used scrubbing brushes to clear it, not always successfully.  I must have liked the razor though as I didn\'t toss it.My Dad was over on holiday and had forgotten his electric razor and was forced to buy a razor.  He happened to get the Fusion Power and he laughed about the five blades and vibrator.  He was soon mightily impressed with it though.  I haven\'t found out though whether he has continued to use it or not.A month ago after the blades for my Quattro were done, I decided to buy this Fusion Power.  I did read the review which were split on whether it shaved any better but everyone, almost, who used it liked it.I bought it and wasn\'t disppointed.  It is a lovely razor to use and the vibrator is novel.I then bought a brand new Mach 3 to compare this Fusion Power with.  I showered then lathered up and did half my face with each one then looked closely.  The shave was pretty much the same for both sides but bear in mind that the blade on the Fusion was a month old!  Mind you both sides felt very smooth although on closer inspection this wasn\'t the case.  It just proved to me that my technique may be a bit average and that you can\'t shave the hairs to the surface of the skin (unlike the simulations you see on TV).I have to say though that the Fusion is one hell of a razor.  It looks so cool and the tactile feel and shape is a big improvement over the Mach 3.  Shaving itself feels much the same though.  I don\'t have a challenging growth though, it is pretty average and I think the most important thing to get a good shave is to shower first.  After a shower you can almost get away with no shaving cream , that\'s how big a difference it makes.Overall in spite of the blades being twice the price almost, I love the fusion.  Gillette have made a product that is a perfect synthesis of engineering genius and marketing passion to produce a truly wonderful prodcut.I hate them of course as they have tempted me to buy a product that is objectively, no better than the Mach 3 but in the final analysis the sex appeal of this fine razor won me over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1874,779,20080207,B000BUW8WM,1,"February 7, 2008",A29WWNOYAM96QB,A Real Dissappointment.,"Let me tell you first, I\'m a Gillette fan, I have been using Gillette razors for over 18 years, I was always excited when they released a new razor because every time it was better than the old one.So, possibly you wonder why I gave a 1-start poor rating to this product. I was excited to buy this new line of product, as being certain it would have been better than the previous line Mach 3 Turbo. Result a real disappointment. Here are the reasons from a Gillette fan you can trust:1. 5 razors don\'t work. Over the years for the sake of competition they made double blades, triple blades than it was not enough they released 5-bladed razors like this one. However, since they needed to put the blades closer to each other to fit 5 blades in a limited area of razor head, it simply didn\'t work. Let\'s continue,2. This product has very sharp blades but since 5-very sharp blades are located very close to each other it resulted very bad maneuverability. You simply cut yourself easily if you made a slight side movement while shaving.3. Blades are so sharp it doesn\'t allow you to focus on flat surfaces for a close shave. It just goes through and if you insisted on getting for a closer shave you will cut yourself.4. You might think I have a sensitive skin type, BUT believe me I don\'t. Believe it or not with a Mach 3 I never cut myself never, never. I have very thick and strong hair, I can\'t use a regular razor for shaving. Only and Only Gillette Mach 3 handles my facial hair but not this one.5. This product has engineering flaws which is resulted from competitive 5-blade which are put very closely together and you cannot handle this razor well even if you are a surgeon. I know because I\'m  very successful with using my hands because of my profession. But thanks to engineers who developed this I cut myself with this razor, for the first time.6. It\'s your choice whether or not you buy this product but I want to remind you that for the first time I\'m taking my time and writing a review for a razor, be careful it\'s a razor not a Gillette anymore.A final personal shaving tip: If you want your high quality razor blades last longer than usual, do not rinse them with hot or warm water while shaving. If you use cold water for rinsing blades, you will see them lasting sharp for a longer period of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all.  They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get, but this was certainly not the case for me and I don\'t think its the case for most people.  Also, when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving.  I now use the Norelco 8150XL electric shaver exclusively and it works like a charm every time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I have to say: I\'ve been shaving for about seventeen years, and never, literally, never ONCE shaved with a blade without cuts or at the very least razor burn.Until today. For people with sensitive skin, this is an absolute miracle. It\'s ridiculously expensive, of course, but if you can swing the money, it\'s definitely worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1910,816,20060923,B000BUW8WM,5,"September 23, 2006",A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,Best shaver I\'ve ever had.,"I\'m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That means shaving everyday or every other day because you go to work.  Because there is so much more surface area in the blade design it really is a breeze to shave.I have quite senitive skin, and I can now finally shave everyday with out getting cut up.HOWEVER... If you leave your face unshaved for more than 3 days... like a full weekend.  It doesnt shave as well.  The long hairs get caught up in the blades and almost rip out.  The Mach 3 does a much better job at long hairs.  It is possible to shave with the fusion, but it takes a longer time since you have to keep rining it out every inch of a shave.I had this razor since the first day it came out.  The best thing  I have noticed is that each blade lasts about 2 weeks. My Mach 3 usually lasted a week.  ( Like i said i have senstive skin and once the blade starts going, my face gets all cut up. )  So blades are more expensive but they do last longer.Overall.  Best razor every if you need to shave frequently.  If you are a contruction worker or someone that only shaves once or twice a week... I wouldnt recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse, she\'s one of those people that reads the manual on everything first, never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging (which she usually copies down in the store).I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present, but that\'s a whole other story. Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice. The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price. This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you\'re only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her, which she thinks is a must. Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The \'ease of use\' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter. Easier than oral, rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data, and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep, which caused my wife to scowl and panic, but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself. Sure, you can go to Target or Wal-Maze and buy yourself another cheapie, but then you\'ll be back exactly where you are now sometime later ... looking for a dependable and accurate ear Thermometer.This is currently the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently I asked my girlfriend to pick up some razors at the store \'not cheap ones please\' and boy was that a mistake. Anyway, I happened to be on Amazon already buying something so I looked at razors and decided on this one. I actually didn\'t know that it was a battery operated razor. I had used a Gillette razor before and it gave me a good shave. So when I got this one with the battery and stuff I was kinda skeptical but figured it would shave good without the vibrations so I didn\'t have to turn it on to shave if I didn\'t want to... I thought maybe it would just carve up my face like a Halloween pumpkin. The first time I used it I was very pleasantly surprised. I figured maybe it was just because it was a brand new blade, which always shave great the first time. I am here writing this review now because after a week and a half of using this thing with the same blade, it\'s still shaving closer than any shave I\'ve ever had before. Really. I have had close shaves before but could still feel where the hair would eventually come back again meaning it was close but like it was only cutting the hair even with the skin and this one seems to cut it even lower if that makes sense. I can\'t believe how smooth my face is. Truly smooth as a baby\'s butt. I have to actually take my time and pay attention now more than before, because if I miss a spot, I can really feel the difference. My girlfriend has really noticed the difference too... (don\'t tell her I said this but it\'s almost annoying how much she is touching and kissing my face now. lol)I didn\'t get any replacement blades with my original order, but I\'ve been looking at the local stores and all the prices have been twice what I see here on Amazon for replacement blades. The actual razor is about the same, but I laughed when I saw 4 replacement blades at Rite Aid for the same price I just bought 8 here on Amazon. I think I\'ll buy some more replacements to have on hand when I go traveling next month.I have no idea what the last reviewer is complaining about. This thing is great... and the extra blade for trimming sideburns is great, even helps me to get under my nose perfectly. I feel no danger of being cut. I really believe this is the most complete and closest shave I have ever had. Very satisfied. I will never use a disposable razor or an electric razor again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impressed by some great reviews here, I decided to give this a try.Using my old Sensor or Mach3/Mach3 turbo I had irritation, averaged 2-3 nicks or cuts per shave, and the razors weren\'t up to cleanly shaving a few difficult areas of my face (under the ear for example).Using this thing, this wondrous Fusion Power Razor, left me with as many, or more, irritated areas, averaged 5+ nicks or cuts per use, and it couldn\'t cleanly shave even the areas the other two razors have no problem with.  Plus, it actually gets stuck shaving against the grain.I\'m serious, it stops moving and you have to put more pressure on it, bear down harder, to get it to move which, of course, results in those extra cuts and irritation, and then it still misses patches of beard you just tried to shave.This is just a waste of money.  The technology behind this is only different, not better.  No doubt it\'s the 5 blade foolishness that makes it stop moving in rougher sections of the beard, and the power blade vibration seems to accomplish nothing at all.I\'m convinced that the rave reviews here are from people new to shaving, people who have light beards, or people getting paid to promote the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both were smooth and both grew back at the same rate.  If there\'s no difference - why wouldn\'t you choose the SOFT shave!!!  Seriously - I don\'t feel those blades - this makes me excited for swimsuit season ... (then again, I won\'t be putting on a swimsuit anyway!!)This razor comes with a case for the replacement blades that you can hang in the shower and that you can hang the razor on.

In less than a minute, I had the case open and the razor up in the bathroom.But styling aside, is it better than a razor with only two blades?  The moisture added around the head is more effective, maybe even a tad oily. I didn\'t find the extra blades to make it any more efficient. I still gave it four stars because it does what it should and it doesn\'t have any glaring faults.**** EDIT: After using this for some time I have come to the conclusion that it is far better than a razor with only two blades.  It cuts shaving time.  And over time, I\'ve found that I have to shave less.  Due to having to take fewer swipes with the blade, I\'ve also found that my skin isn\'t as irritated.  I have fewer and less visible razor bumps/stubble. I haven\'t even had to change blades yet. I\'ve been using just plain cold water to shave and my skin also feels very moisturized.

The ShowerPod also holds extra razor cartridges which I found to be another great feature.I have to say it really does give you a close shave.

I was beginning to think that the competition to create a razor with the largest number of blades was getting ridiculous. I starting shaving my legs with the original single blade razors which did often cause embarrassing scrapes and cuts. The twin blade was a much heralded advance that resulted in a better shave and less abrasions. I even bought into the triple blade and was impressed, but  I drew the line at the quattro. This was getting ridiculous. Soon we would not have to move the instrument more than a millimeter to shave an entire calf. Come on!?The free vine product enticed me to try the Embrace five blade razor and its a winner. The shave was safe and incredibly smooth. I like the idea of the replaceable cartridge in the comfortable and light weight plastic handle. The case that suctions to the shower wall is a cute extra but not a reason to purchase this razor.

Therefore, this new razor has an appeal for me because it actually  1) feels good as I hold it (I make jewelry, and I like the feel of a well made tool in my hand--this razor, Venus Embrace, is almost ergonomically designed) and 2) feels good as it glides on my legs.The pod holder won\'t work out here, as we have children. Anyone who leaves an exposed razor in the shower, held by a pod wih suction cups, who has kids, is, of course, insane. I suppose I see the appeal of the pod for childless people, who want a razor which has a station where it can be \'docked\' to air-dry conveniently, and there IS a good spot for the extra cartidges to be stored inside.The pod looks like a small space ship or a mini house designed by a famous architect, or possibly it just resembles an egg. I enjoyed looking at it for a while before I locked it and the razor in the closet after using them.I definitely recommend this razor and I will continue to use it.

The review by Cherise Everhard nails it.LONG VERSION: Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty must be reclining comfortably in her mansion in the Pantheon subdivision on Mount Olympus, counting the revenue from her licensing deal with Gillette. The sale of the razor blades alone must be quite profitable, allowing her to fill her closets with designer togas.This is one of those products that get written about in marketing studies. Where the basic item, a computer printer, for example, has a reasonable retail price but the ink refills are the longterm profit center. In this case, the razor is quite a good value, the price of the razor blades, however, leave you breathless!I myself was seduced by the allure of Venus when a women\'s magazine named the Venus Embrace Razor one of the beauty innovations of the year. (Yes, I read women\'s magazines! So what? This is a women\'s product! If you are a guy reading this review, you can just take off your judgemental hat and go back to watching the droning ball game on the sofa where you usually repose. Relax, have a beer!)Not being able to purchase Mach 2 razor blades anywhere for any price was causing me upset. I had a perfectly good razor that was totally useless. I bought a Soleil. It was French. It was pink-orange and white like a creamsicle. It was curved like a dolphin. It had three blades which was one more than the Mach 2 had. I was unimpressed.So, there I was, with a three bladed razor thinking that this was not nearly enough.Listen, hair removal is a tricky business. There are multiple solutions to the problem, some very, very bad and some very, very good. With chemotherapy and radiation being the very worst solutions, the best solution, in my admittedly fairly limited experience, is waxing. Unfortunately there are times when waxing is inconvenient. Like 10 minutes before you are planning to leave for the beach and you feel some stubble on your ankles. This is when you really need a razor.So I read about the Venus Embrace being an innovation of the year and I was hooked.What you get when you buy the \'starter kit\' is:- A pretty, ergonomically curved razor that has \'attractive sea foam green and turquoise\' (purple and teal) colored gel inserts on the handle. These cause a squishy/sticky feel that is not unpleasant but somewhat odd.... like holding a silicone spatula or a dog toy. The manufacturer claims that these gel inserts cause the razor handle to sit more firmly in the hand and not to slip.-The blade. The \'business end\' of the razor is HUGE! Its an oval shaped disk that contains five \'spring mounted\' blades that are surrounded by wide areas of plastic covered by variously colored slippery coatings that the manufacturer describes as \' Protective Ribbon of Moisture\'.-An extra razor cartride which comes packed in a clever, water-proof, sealed plastic container.-A plastic \'Shower Pod\' which is a small holder for the razor and extra blades that is supposed to attach to the bathroom tile with a suction cup.The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is the sticky/squishy feel of the razor handle. The blade cartridge sits safely in its sealed plastic container and is easily inserted on to the handle.The blade is sized perhaps for true Olympians like Venus Williams rather than mere mortal-sized women such as I. Did I mention is is HUGE? Paul Bunyon huge. Yo, Venus! Did you actually approve the size of this cartridge? I bet not.The shower pod is a tacky plastic thing that would not stay suctioned to my tile wall. It went directly into the trash.Although the razor head pivots, the blades are \'spring loaded\', there are moisture strips, and the handle is curved and tricked out with gel inserts, the Venus Embrace razor is unwieldy. It just doesn\'t go where you want it to go when you want it to go there. And when it goes there you don\'t really get such a close shave. I don\'t notice any better shaving than with my old Mach 2.What I have noticed about the Venus Embrace is that I have not cut myself once and I have not experienced razor burn. These were not significant problems with my Mach 2 but I thought I should mention them.My fundamental saddness with this product arrived when I needed to purchase additional blades and sticker shock set in. Three buckeroos a cartridge makes one think once or twice about continuing to use this razor. Sorry Goddess Venus, but that\'s one Sister\'s opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought it was an advertising gimmick.Then I tried the Venus, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Honest-to-goodness, it\'s like shaving your legs with a piece of satin, and it gets every hair, too.  The lubrication strips are better than others I\'ve tried--you really don\'t need shaving cream or soap, and they last quite a while.The Venus has the added advantage of a holder that suction-cups to the shower wall, so you don\'t lose the razor.  So far it has stayed put.  Inside the holder is a spare blade, so if you decide it\'s time to change blades, you don\'t have to venture dripping from the shower to find a refill.Yeah, the blades are expensive.  But I HATE shaving my legs, and anything that can make it quicker, easier and more comfortable is worth my money.  The Venus is a bit more ecological than disposable razors, too.

It makes for a much more comfortable feel. I personally would have liked the handle to be a little bit wider, like maybe half an inch, but I\'m still pretty pleased with the shape and feel. While the Divine didn\'t slip in my hand very often, the Embrace doesn\'t slip in my hand at all, so there\'s less of a chance of a painful nick.The Embrace has a slightly larger razor head because of the \'ribbon of moisture\' strips around the blades. The larger razor head is a little annoying because I have to be more careful about maneuvering the razor over my \'bumps.\'However, I am extremely pleased by those \'ribbon of moisture\' strips. They make for an incredibly comfortable shave, much more so than the Divine. I could tell the difference in feel right away and it was amazing. Just that factor alone made this razor worth the price.The Embrace has five blades while the Divine has only three blades, and I can\'t really say I notice a difference in shaving efficiency or closeness because of the extra two blades. I *might* be able to feel a slight advantage to the extra blades, but I\'m also not entirely sure if that\'s all in my head or if it\'s real.The ShowerPod that comes with the Embrace allows you to snap your razor into place and store extra blades inside the plastic pod. It attaches to your shower wall via suction cups, which in my opinion is a huge improvement over the old Venus ShowerPods that required you to attach them with double-sided foam tape. The ShowerPod is a nice place to store the razor in the shower, but I honestly think the whole concept of storing extra blades in the shower is unnecessary. I never change my blades in the shower--I do it before or after--so in my opinion, the storage space in the ShowerPod is a waste of plastic.All in all, this is a great razor if only for the fact it\'s so much more comfortable than the Divine. Don\'t get me wrong, the Divine wasn\'t uncomfortable at all, but the Embrace has improved the model significantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can burn holes through 3 layers of clothes, flame-retardant or otherwise.Until they met the glorious power of Gillette Clinical Strength. They leave my pits begging for mercy, confused and packing home to momma. Plus it smells great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2407,1323,20110912,B001F51QJ8,5,"September 12, 2011",A258HYBAKW1EAB,Great product.,I used to have excessive perspiration. Now i do not.It really is that simple.I personally prefer this over the Degree version (it is a normal shaped stick as opposed to Degree\'s narrow odd shape) because the scent is more appeasing.I would give this 6 stars if i could.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2409,1325,20090326,B001F51QJ8,3,"March 26, 2009",A3N9TOPHBENB9I,A perfectly adequate product,"I obtained this product through the Vine program for a male member of my family to evaluate.  First thing he noticed was that he had to turn the wheel (pushing the product upward) many many times to get it to reach the surface where it could be used.  Therefore, it is obvious that the container is not completely full, and therefore the user is actually getting less product than the size of the container would imply.  The directions say \'three clicks.\'  Yeah, right.  That may be true after the first use, but certainly not true for the initial use.  Also, the name of the anti-perspirant includes the words \'advanced solid,\' but the stuff that exuded from the little holes in the top sure looks like a thick cream.Other than that, all he could say about the product is that it seems to be a perfectly adequate anti-perspirant.  Even though he is a very active guy, he was neither negatively nor positively impressed.  Maybe he had a rather neutral reaction to it because he is just not the type of guy who stays awake at night wondering if he has damp spots on his shirt in the summertime that might gross-out his coworkers.In any case, he felt that the product does the job, but he wondered if it was worth the price differential over other brands.  For roughly the same amount of money, one can purchase four-packs of other name-brand anti-perspirants that work (in his estimation) just as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This could save a large amount of money. Degree works well for me. If you have tried many brands with little success, I do recommend trying a clinical strength.  Personally, I believe it is more about marketing than anything. The consumer sees Clinical Strength and believes it has to be betterGillette Clinical does work well and does provide protection all day for me but so does Degree and at a fraction of the cost.The high price is the reason I gave four stars.Product Effectiveness - 5 StarsProduct Cost - 3 Stars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within an hour the light scent goes away regardless.The active ingredient is Aluminum Zirconium Trichlorohydrex Gly 20% (anhydrous). They recommend applying before bed. It\'s also more of a cream that gets absorbed into your body rather than a solid.Although I was impressed with the effectiveness, I\'m going to put it away for now and take it out for those hot and humid days when I\'m going to be outside.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It went on smooth and comfortably and it disappeared and was dry very quickly.Protection wise it\'s great.  When I read that it has a masking fragrance I was concerned that masking might mean overpowering or I\'d smell like freshly washed guy with too much cologne, luckily I was in for a surprise.  The scent of this, on application, is almost unnoticeable- it does smell a little bit like \'unscented deodorant\' (which to my sensitive nose still has a scent) but then nothing- absolutely nothing.  I was thrilled! I have a sensitive nose and sensitive skin and neither were agitated by Gillette clinical strength anti-perspirant.I think this would be great for people who sweat a ton or if working hard in a very humid environment.  Does the job, doesn\'t smell, and keeps you from being horribly smelly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have really sensitive underarms and the only sticks that seems to work without irritating me is a dove powder version of deodorant a/p. This gillette version works OK - but I can begin to feel it irritating my skin. The use overnight direction was a little weird. I shower in the morning - so this option is not really viable. But if you shower at night - this stuff is designed to be applied the night before.So back to the regular old Dove ....If you are looking for something to help irritation - I suggest Dove , powder scent as a good starting point.

I also work long hours at a desk and need something that can keep me halfway fresh with these activities.  I have found that this product works very well.  It is strong, so strong in fact that I can use it every other day at times depending on my activity level.  It does not give you that uncomfortable dry and impossible to wash feeling under the arms.  At the same time, it keeps me dry.  It does not have a strong scent at all so look elsewhere or add an aftershave if you are looking to smell good.  Most importantly for me, I have not reacted at all to this product.  Summary - it has worked very well for me and I recommend it to you.  Cheers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

      </div>

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

This stuff is incredible. The sweatiest of the sweaty and the stinkiest of the stinky will be really happy with this product. I've had better luck with it than anything else.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

There really isn't a whole lot to say about this. It works, it smells good, it keeps me smelling good and not sweaty. That's about it.

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

      </div>

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

There really isn't a whole lot to say about this. It works, it smells good, it keeps me smelling good and not sweaty. That's about it.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

      </div>

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

Unfortunately, the price is quite high and I can\'t imagine spending around $10 for a single stick.The product goes on smoothly and doesn\'t chalk up like competitive products. It was absolutely effective for me for 24 hours. The instructions advise putting it on the night before; I tried using it in the evening and starting off with it in the daytime, but didn\'t notice a significant difference.The product has a pleasant and extremely subtle scent. You\'ll know that that you\'re wearing it when you\'ve just applied it, but it definitely won\'t overpower any cologne or perfume you might be using.Overall, this I found Gillette\'s Clinical Strength Anti-perspirant to be an effective and smooth product. It\'s just expensive compared to its competitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4006,1382,20090511,B001F51QJ8,5,"May 11, 2009",A3S5WYWYKSAI9C,"Good, clean, fun","Finally, a \'clinical strength\' antiperspirant without the messy business of perfumes.  This stick provided all of the wetness protection I needed without stinking me up like \'sport scent\' or \'fresh powder\' or whatever other synthetic smells these things contain.The real question: does it work?  To this I answer a resounding YES.To demonstrate, I took this with me to Bali in lieu of a normal travel sized deodorant.  I wanted to stay dry without smelling something that might attract extra blood suckers.  Bali is hot, humid, and very prone to making people sweaty.  Did this stick solve all of my sweat problems?  Absolutely not.  Did it mitigate some of the unsightly wet spots that come with being human?  Absolutely.My only complaint, and this is about all aluminum oxide antiperspirants, is that the chemicals stain the pits of white shirts yellow.  Not cool, but I\'ve yet to find a way around it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4015,1391,20090423,B001F51QJ8,5,"April 23, 2009",APZWKX3F1YX37,"Works great, just like all the other brands...","I usually buy the Old Spice Clinical because I sweat a lot.  It does work better then the standard deoderant.  The cost, compared to the standard stick, is almost doubled.  I think its worth the extra money though.  I hate walking into a room afraid to put my arms up.  I used to wear only black because the sweat isn\'t as noticeable.  However, this clinical formula, in case anyone was wondering, does not help with anxiety sweating.  That would have been nice.  Too bad...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to give this Gillette a shot, and needless to say, was a little disappointed.Does it keep my drier?  Well, when used correctly (apply at night, which was hard to get used to) and not washing underneath my arms in the shower in the morning, it worked slightly better than what I\'m used to.  The problem is, however, that it\'s not realistic.  Sure, I can get used to applying deodorant on at night.  But can I get used to NOT scrubbing underneath my arms during my morning shower?  Ummm...no.I tried the unscented kind, which was fine - literally no scent.  I experienced no irritation or any other kind of side effect from it.I ended up being slightly drier, but still sweaty using the Gillette.  I\'m sure everyone is different, and maybe I\'m a profuse sweater, but it just didn\'t work enough for me to justify the premium (costs over twice what I normally get for marginal results).It might be worth a shot if you\'re desperately looking for a solution to underarm perspiration.  It\'s certainly a cheaper alternative than paying for $700 Botox injections every 6 months.  But don\'t expect this to be the answer to your prayers.  At least for me, it certainly wasn\'t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But after using the product for a couple weeks, he was impressed with the anti-perspirant ability.  He\'s been working on a home remodel, and as the temperatures are warming up, he\'s still happy with the dry feeling.  I tried it too, and although I prefer a drier stick type application, I can\'t fault the way it keeps me dry. It\'s a keeper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My commute to and from work involves a good deal of walking. Over the years of trying different antiperspirants (Old Spice, Arm & Hammer, Right Guard, etc...) I had finally found something that protected me all day...Degree. I\'d get into work with my shirt looking like I\'d just went through a bit of a downpour, but my armpits were covered.So Degree is my standard of performance to which I judge the Gillette by.I also have a favorite scent of Degree (Power, which used to be Powder...But I\'m guessing the Marketing team thought men would have an easier time picking up Power). In essence my Degree serves as my antiperspirant and cologne.Using the Gillette is certainly different and away from the norm...Instructions state that the product should be applied before going to sleep and you\'ll be all set for the following entire day! Supposedly you could even take a shower and still be protected!As well, the stuff goes on clear and clean. The next morning you don\'t even know you\'ve got anything on, and it delivers on its\' promise of all day protection as well.This product really is an excellent antiperspirant, the only reason I didn\'t give it a full 5 stars is that I feel too high a premium is asked for this product. Even at the current sale price, I can get almost 2x more of my usual Degree antiperspirant at 1/2 the cost of just 1 of these Gillettes (yes, taking into account that this is a 2pack of Gillettes)!!If you don\'t mind the premium though, and you want something clean, clear and WORKS as promised...Then I wholeheartedly recommend this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4034,1410,20090407,B001F51QJ8,2,"April 7, 2009",AXU3VKZE848IY,"It\'s not bad, simply not that much better than others","Gillette clinical strength.I have used this product for over a week now. My reference product was Mennen Speed Stick Antiperspirant Icy Blast. In my reviews I always try do some concrete data gathering, so for this test I compared performance under extra warm conditions and extra stress conditions. The extra clothing or heat induced perspiration was controlled 100% effectively by both products. Under stress situation (such as an important presentation), the Gillette Clinical Strength (GCS) did perform marginally better. I would estimate that a 2 by 2 inch \'wet spot\' with Mennen Speed Stick (MSS) was reduced to about a 1.5 by 1.5 inch spot with GCS, for a 40% better wetness control. Sorry for the graphical details.So I perspire more under stress than under heat. The instructions for GCS are elaborate, three clicks of the screw applied the night before, metered through a bunch of small holes (typical of gel antiperspirants). The fragrance is subtle and baby powder like. Interestingly enough on the ingredients list its referred to as a \'masking fragrance\'.Now for the analysis. The active ingredient in both products is Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex in MSS (or trichlorohydrex in GCS). They are both in the same antiperspirant family as far as any wikipedia or dermatology website explain. The MSS contains 15% active ingredient, while the GCS contains 20% active ingredient. So in summary one additional swipe with the non clinical product gives you as much protection as a \'clinical strength\' product. The clinical product contains 1.7 oz vs 2.7 oz (40% less) for regular and costs over twice as much. For basically same product??? So do the math, and apply one more swipe of your regular product.

We both used this right after a shower and spent the whole day in the hot sun of florida working on the garden. By noon we both noticed we were getting rather fragrant and not in a good way. He kept trying it during the week while working in the very hot sun and by the fourth day of giving it every chance to work (using daily applications) he went back to his old Mitchum. I also tried it for a few more days and even spending the day in AC it wasn\'t working at all by late afternoon. I also went back to my old suave which works great for me. Another problem with this product is that the knob breaks easily if turned in the opposite direction so keep that in mind if you are brave enough to give this a try.

The razors were ordinary razors, from Gillette. Those razors don\'t come into this tale. But attached to the outside of the pack of ordinary razors was one special razor, a sample of another razor model. This is its story.At first, the special razor lay in the bathroom drawer, watching as ordinary razors were used and thrown away, used and thrown away. It was a lonely existence as the only one of its kind. No bright colors or fancy features made this razor stand out from the crowd. Razors came and razors went as the tough-bearded man shaved his sensitive face.Then one day it was the special razor\'s turn.The first shave was fine, a nice close shave that didn\'t sting that sensitive face. It might even have ended that day, if the rough-bearded man had thrown the special razor in the trash. But he didn\'t, for he was frugal too.The second shave was fine as well.And the third. Unusual, thought the rough-bearded man.But the fourth time he shaved his sensitive face with the special razor is when he began to suspect that this razor was special, indeed. What razor stays sharp for four shaves? And a disposable too! The man felt his smooth skin and wondered if it could be. He set the razor aside just in case, on the slimmest hopes there could be another smooth shave. How wonderful, how magical that would be!The next day came, as they always do. And the rough-bearded man lifted the special razor to his sensitive face. And shaved.No pulling! No stinging! A smooth and silky shave! It was all true. Then the rough-bearded man knew that this was not merely a special razor. Nay, this was indeed -- a Magic Razor!He asked the razor its name. The razor said, \'Gillette Custom Plus 3 Sensitive\'.The rough-bearded man with the sensitive face smiled a wide smile with his smooth skin. Some say the razor smiled too.The End",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought I\'d give them a try, seeing how they\'re almost 1/2 the cost (per blade) as my non-disposable Turbo blades. WHAT A MISTAKE! These blades are comparatively very dull right out of the box compared to the Turbo blades, and I\'m lucky if I can get 3 shaves out of them before needing to throw them away. Worse yet, they do NOT provide a close shave, they nick the hell out of my face, and sometimes that occurs on the very first use of a brand-new blade. Still, I thought I better do a cost comparison, since the Turbo blades are so much more expensive. So, here\'s the net-net:Sensor3 Disposables: $1.57/per razor, $0.52/per shave (based on 3-shave average per blade)Mach3 Turbo Non-Disposable: $3.05/per razor, $0.43/per shave (based on 7-shave average per blade)When you factor in that I\'m getting a much closer and complete shave with the Mach3, virtually zero nicks (I average probably 1x every 6 months at most), and better pricing on my Mach3\'s online, I\'m not going to be buying any more Sensor3 blades...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sensor Excel blades were the first among Gillette razors to add rubberized \'microfins\' at the bottom of the cartridges...a standard they have included on every Gillette produce since Excel\'s debut. But with so many razors brought to market since its rollout, how does Sensor Excel stand up to competition today?Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor Excel. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Excel cartridges are noticeably smaller than, say, Mach 3 cartridges (about 1/3 smaller). The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than most razor systems today. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are very easy to shave as a result.The shave: 4.5 stars. One can tell that this truly was Gillette\'s workhorse model for quite some time, and that a lot of research & development went into the creation of this system. The Sensor Excel offers a comfortable shave with minimal drag, leaving the user feeling clean and smooth. As stated above, the blade angle and smaller cartridge design allows for easy precision shaving of sideburns and moustache/goatee areas--an ideal choice for men who maintain those types of facial hair. It is noteworthy that, as a person with sensitive skin, I felt no facial sensitivity after shaving with the Sensor Excel--something that I cannot say about newer razors such as Quattro and Fusion. For those with sensitive skin, this would perhaps be a wise choice.Durability: 2.5 stars. This was where Sensor Excel disappointed me. I get, at most, three shaves out of one cartridge. Drag and other issues resulting from dull blades arose quickly after two to three shaves. It\'s safe to say Sensor Excel has been surpassed by newer razors that have better blade coatings. By comparison, during my testing of the Gillette Fusion I got almost two weeks out of one cartridge. However, with the steep cost of blades for newer razors, Sensor Excel may still be a more affordable option.Overall: A fine razor offering a no-frills kind of approach to shaving. No advertising or fancy marketing to deal with when it comes to Sensor Excel--just a razor that does what it\'s supposed to do, well. Durability comes into question here as newer razors offer better blade coatings, but still a smart choice for those who don\'t buy into (and don\'t need) the uber-bladed razor trend.

4212,1593,20090722,B001JQLNFA,2,"July 22, 2009",A3NV2COCU1EFC3,Don\'t Throw Away the Shaving Cream Yet,"Let me preface this review by saying that I hate shaving. I shave a lot of stuff- legs, arms, armpits, bikini area, and my big toe. I can get away with shaving some areas once a week, but my legs need to be shaved at least every other day during the summer or there is visable black stubble. I have very sensitive skin that often gets razor burn and ingrown hairs. So I got this thinking, perfect! Three blades= close shave; built in shave gel= more convenient and faster.Well, there are several issues with this razor. During the first use, I noticed two things: One, there is a lot of slobbery goop coming off the razor... and two, the shave gel bars that sit above and below the blades make it very difficult to get a close shave. They do flex a little, but especially when they are new, they are cumbersome and they block the blades from getting close enough to the skin, especially in contoured areas like the knee and the bikini area. It does moisturize well, though, and at least for the first use or two, you won\'t need to use any shaving cream. I didn\'t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn\'t able to shave.By the third use, those gel bars have worn down a little (or a lot) and you can get a closer shave. But now with less slobbery gel goop, you are very likely to have irritated skin or little cuts. I have to use soap to lubricate my skin before shaving if the cartridge is not brand new, and I keep cutting my armpit with this razor and I didn\'t seem to have that problem with the regular Venus razor.The gel is either gone or falls off by about the fifth or sixth use. These cartridges are just way too expensive to have to replace them so often. I found that leaving the razor in the shower cuts it\'s life even shorter so I keep it in a cupboard when I\'m not using it... so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn\'t serve much purpose. Maybe if you are the only one who uses your shower and you shave every time you\'re in there you can get some use out of it.I like using this on my legs during the summer when I shave every day and I don\'t want to spend the extra time with shaving cream. I don\'t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble. I wouldn\'t buy this again- the regular Venus is easier to maneuver and shaves closer. Even if I have to buy shaving cream again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is soft and not too overwhelming.I feared that this product might not deliver a close shave, but indeed I was wrong. What I like best about these razors is no shaving cream or additional lather is required. Just wet the blade and shave away. It couldn\'t be easier. I *hate* to shave and this definitely makes the whole experience a lot more pleasant and easy. The blades are a bit more expensive then the cheap, pink daisy razors that I have always used, but they last for a long time.I have been changing the blade about once every 10 days and I typically shave every other day.

I have to admit the Venus Breeze has some real positives to it. The styling is pretty, pink (real girly-girl factor) and fits well in your hand (ergonomically). The packaging is well done and the way the razor blades are packaged within their own little cups, is a real cute design.I find the overly large spa strips (with lotion) to be both a positive and a negative factor when dealing with the Venus. First, when using on your legs, I have to admit it\'s really great. I found the shave to be close and my legs were amazingly smooth after using it (almost as if I had used some kind of baby lotion or shaving cream on my legs). However, when I tried to use it on my underarms and bikini area, I found the stips as well as the pivoting factor of the razor design, to make it awkward and almost impossible to get a good shave. If you are looking for a razor to use primarily on your legs, then this one is it. However, if you are looking for an all around razor, this may not work for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4226,1608,20090521,B001JQLNFA,4,"May 21, 2009",A2K3DB7X56UXLZ,"Excellent razor, but no design improvements over existing Venus razors","For those who have used a Venus razor:  The only difference between this Venus and previous instances, as best as I could tell, was the scent of the gel/soap bars and the color of the razor handle.  Otherwise, it\'s the same razor.For those who have not used a Venus razor:There are three main features of a Venus razor versus a standard multi-blade women\'s razor.The first is the soap/gel bars.  These bars basically provide the glide that you usually get from shave gel or foam.  You can definitely shave without lathering up.  That saves you time and cost.  However, the bars do mean that you have to press a little harder than you might be used to when the razor head is new to get a close shave.  (As the bars wear down from use, you don\'t have to press as hard.)  Until you get used to this, you may notice some unintended stubble.  Also, the bars make it a little tough to clean the razor.  I\'ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I\'m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  It\'d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  I really liked the scent on this one, and I\'m not normally a fan of shave gel scents.The second big feature of the Venus line is the easy-to-change razor head.  When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  Then, you open a sealed replacement head and click the handle into the slot.  It\'s a much safer and easier replacement process than razors I\'ve owned in the past.  Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it\'s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  Each razor head is individually packaged, so it\'s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  You don\'t have to worry about cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.The third feature is the hanging rack.  The Venus razor kit comes with a mounting rack for your shower.  The rack sticks to the shower wall using adhesive pads, and it holds 4 replacement blades (not included) and the razor with a blade attached.  I\'ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  Gillette didn\'t improve on this design for the Spa Breeze line.  I was hoping they\'d offer a suction-cup design.  Also, the design is such that you can\'t really use it unless you wall mount it.  The razor needs gravity to stay in place, and because the bottom of the rack is rounded, you can\'t just set it vertically on a shelf.  I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.As for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  I have very fine hair.  Many razors just aren\'t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I\'ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)All in all, the Venus line is excellent.  I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  I\'d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, the gel kind of goops, at first especially, and we found it kind of gooping off of she razor when not in use. I also found that while shaving arm pits, you need to apply some pressure to get the blades close to your skin - well, I don\'t like to do that when shaving there.

The new scent is pleasant & the color is pretty and girly.The problem with these (versus the other brand of 3-blade girl shavers) is that the strip of shaving gel disappears long before the blade wears out, but the extra surface area where the gel was is then irritating, so you can\'t really use it once the gel\'s gone, even though the blade is still perfectly good. The triple blades are usually very long lasting, but with the irritating little pads dragging along your shaving surface, the long-life blades become an unusable waste. If your skin\'s not sensitive, this might not be an issue.That said, it does give a great shave, even on bikini line, and it is very handy to have an all-in one for travel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I got it home I quickly found it to be misery on a stick as it snagged my skin and pulled out any surrounding longer hairs by the roots. It was also too wide for sensitive areas.When Amazon offered this one I was a bit skeptical at first but decided to try something made specifically for a woman. I\'m glad I did. This three bladed shaver glides easily, works well over sharp angles and with its built in shaving soap is the perfect touch up razor before a quick run to the pool.I mounted the included razor case (using the material provided) to the left of the shower head and keep it there in its holder. So far I\'ve managed four shaves off of one blade and I anticipate more.

It does NOT navigate curvy legs very well. I had more than one significant cut the first time I used it.  I felt like the head pivoted a little TOO much which made it hard to keep the blades in contact with my skin.  The gels strips do not lather, but do have a very strong, but not unpleasant fragrance.  However, if you are sensitive to perfume, this is not your razor.Because the head is so bulky, the shave actually took longer than with a straight razor. The bulbous looking things on either side of the blade created drag on curved areas, such as underarms and ankles and didn\'t glide over those areas successfully.  I had to go over them several times to remove all unwanted hair.I would say this is BETTER than the Soliel razor that I bought for less money (smoother shave) but not as good as the Venus Embrace which gave me a smoother shave with a little less effort and no heavy perfume.My overall complaint with ALL of the Gillette Venus line is that the razors are very bulky. They do provide a good shave, but you have to cover the same areas more than once because the shave head is so large.  For my sensitive skin, that means more razor irritation.  I would recommend this one over several other out there, but if you want the best shave for the same price, go with the Embrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I always found that women\'s razors worked better for this area because men\'s razors are meant for the face (I use the Gillette Fusion for this every other day activity) and have tried quite a bit since I started with this habit back in 2002/2003.  Like with the men\'s razors the products keep getting better with time and the Venus Spa Breeze is no exception.  With this latest incarnation the soap has been attached to the blades and a nice scent has been added as upgrades.  The old Venus blades always worked great but this upgrade is definitely a worthwhile one.  The pros are that the soap produced makes for a smoother shave and more clean and the smell really is nice.  The cons are that I would imagine these new blades are much more $$$ than the old Venus razors with regular cream and the soap attached doesn\'t allow you the same kind of control that you had before.If you like not having to lather up and don\'t mind spending the extra money this is a fine product.  If you want to save some cash and just use lather + the standard Venus product you can\'t go wrong there either.

This changes shaving for me from now on. It\'s aggravating to have to use shaving cream and with the Venus Spa Breeze, you don\'t need it.Perfect for shaving in the shower, just wet the razor and glide the razor over your legs. A smooth shave with no irritation. Afterwards, my legs were incredibly smooth and soft. Just be careful over smaller areas like underarms to be sure you have plenty of water to avoid irritation. It seemed the longer that I used the razor like over the long stretches of leg, the shave gel bars seem to really work the best. The razor doesn\'t produce foam or cream like actual shaving cream but just a slick moisturizer, that\'s why it works best with plenty of water.*Note* If you are currently a regular Venus razor user, the cartridges for the Venus Spa Breeze fit the blue Venus handle also so you could just purchase the Spa Breeze cartridges to use with your current handle.Highly recommend.

I\'ve tried alternative blades, including old-fashioned double edge blades, and although I resist buying and using the Mach3 because IMO the cartridges are way overpriced (one source says the cartridges cost 9 cents to produce, yet they typically retail for around $2.30 per cartridge), I always return to the Mach3 because it gives me the cleanest, most consistently bloodless shave.I\'m looking now at the Mach3 I bought back when they were introduced side by side with a Mach3 disposable, and if there is any difference between the actual shaving heads, I cannot detect it. I don\'t know if handles that hold Mach3 cartridges are made the same as they were when I bought mine, but my old one has some metal on it and is heavier than the disposable, which is all plastic and rubber. The handle of the disposable is fatter than that on my old Mach3, making for a somewhat more comfortable grip.I bought this 6-pack of disposables because with Amazon\'s present special offer (a $2 e-coupon that is applied at checkout) the price per unit is only around $1.80 each (compared, as I say above, to an average price of around $2.30 per cartridge). When I use these up I\'ll look for the best price I can find on Mach3 cartridges or disposables and will purchase whichever is cheapest.These disposables have clear covers over the blades, which slide off and can easily be slid back on, making them especially handy for travel.A few years ago, after shaving for around four decades with various shaving foams, I discovered Aveeno shave gel and have used it ever since.

First of all, the gel bars fall off after a few uses (and it just doesn\'t work with only one gel bar), well before the blade itself is worn out, and with the cost of cartridges you can\'t justify throwing it away after this happens.  So what you are left with is a razor with NO lubrication, and you end up having to use soap or shaving cream anyway if you want to get the full life out of your blade.

Oddly enough, my shaving rituals are contrarian. While King Gillette invented the safety razor, I prefer Schick products (until now). In electrics, I prefer Braun, which is a Gillette subsidiary. Weird, huh?My new razor, and my all-time favorite so far is the Emjoli. Hard to find at a reasonable price, but if you find a deal, THAT is the best multi-blade razor.Gillette, you almost had me for a while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a great deal for the price.  $4.20 with free shipping.  I have used these shavers for several years and I like them.  I'll use this one when I travel.

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

The razor works well and gives me a nice clean shave, and is an improvement over anything else I've used.

This was a great deal for the price.  $4.20 with free shipping.  I have used these shavers for several years and I like them.  I'll use this one when I travel.

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

Secondly, the blades don\'t last long enough to justify the retail price of the product.As I stated, if you can get this razor at a high discount (which is common throughout the summer months), it\'s worth it.

The head is far too bulky to shave knees, ankles, and bikini area.The Proglide, on the other hand, is a dream!

Basically, I was just looking for a replacement handle for my regular fusion cartridges, because I left mine in the locker room. I read that it should fit the older cartridges, and for $3 bucks, I figured it was a good deal. My disappointment came when I opened the package from Amazon today and realized that it did not have a tray/holder for the razor/handle to sit on. I don\'t want this thing loose in my bag, and was expecting it to have something for it to sit in. I\'m sure it will shave great tomorrow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Always though it would be too much trouble, or I was going to hack myself up.  Well, the other day I saw the commercial for Gillette Fusion Proglide and it sparked my interest.  If it does what it says, I was finally ready.  I was tired of the electric razor, shaving my neck was always a difficult adventure, always had to pre-shave so that the hairs were not too long, or the electric would yank those hairs out!So I finally took the plunge, while out picking up a few things, I grabbed the Gillette Fusion Proglide, and took it home, hoping that it was as easy as it sounded.  Since shaving with a electric was a different animal, and I wasn\'t sure how to go about it, I checked out the Gillette site to find a nice video on pre-shaving rituals, and much more.So after dinner I went at it, this rookie prepped his skin and hairs, and foamed up with the gel that came with the razor.  I started slowly, and softly, and there was barely any feeling.  As I started to figure out how much pressure I could use, and what was the best direction to shave the parts of my face, it was a snap.The first shave took me as long as my electric, but I that\'s the first time rookie shave, it will, and did get easier as I went along.  It was sooooo easy to shave my neck, and absolutely no tugging, and didn\'t get a nick or cut.Being the first manual razor I\'d ever own, and being an absolute rookie at this, the Gillette Fusion Proglide was  the best shaving experience I\'d ever had, and I would recommend the razor to everyone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5582,1882,20100919,B003983HRI,5,"September 19, 2010",A20G68XVFC4G6G,"Good handle, very good cartridge so far","There\'s no doubt the proglide version of the Gillette fusion is outstanding. But is it sigificantly better than the original fusion? This is what I\'ve found. I shave in the shower, warm water, using a unscented Gillette shaving gel. The handle of the proglide has a slightly different shape, more of a knob at the end. I suppose the knobv makes it easier to grasp the end of the razor when making gentle swipes alog the skin, sort of an artist at work. But the handle of the original fusion is also okay, and I don\'t think the new handle is much of an improvement, if any. The blades in  the cartridge are great, more than marginally better than the original. A few easy swipes do the job for most of the face. I\'ve found the razor shaves closer than the original about the neck and above the upper lip. Result is the shave time is quicker with a good result. I also believe a proglide cartridge will last longer than the fusion. I\'ve used one cartridge for about twenty shaves, and so far it is doing the job. thus, since the cartridge seems to give more shaves, that fact ought to offset the extra cost. Bottom line is, the new proglide fusion is great, better than the original, but since the original fusion cartridges also do a great jobb, I plan to use them up before switching over to the proglide.Update april 2011 - I think the proglide works best for men who shave every day, and against the grain for a close shave. The blades are thin and close and work best with short hairs. When shaving with two or more days of growth, hthen it\'s best to first shave downward, with the grain, and then up against the grain to get a close shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I find is I feel like its not shaving it is so easy to use and the results are a smooth shave no bumps or irration. Yes, very expensive and when I tried to go back to hydro I longed for proglide so here I am very satisfied albeit the price is high but my hopes are the price will drop a bit. I wish hydro would come up with a thinner blade because it really does matter. Everyones shaving experience is different but I am able to use the blade a minimum of 5 times before the blade degrades.

I can sympathize.  When you go as far as to skip shaving because it\'s too expensive, you know there\'s a problem.However, I\'ve found that the Fusion blades are, like the Mach 3 before them, worth the extra cost.  I have very thick, fast-growing facial hair, which earned me more than my share of scrutiny when I was in the military.  Therefore, I need razors that can cut through it without excessive strokes that each take a bit of skin with them.The Mach 3 was a huge improvement over dual-blade razors for me, and for quite a while I stuck with those rather than paying a premium for the Fusion 5-blades.  Also affecting my decision was the old Onion article: \'**** Everything, We\'re Doing Five Blades,\' which reinforced my perception that a five-bladed razor was nothing but a marketing gimmick.And perhaps it is - but it shaves noticeably better than the Mach 3, either because of the additional blades or some other less-obvious improvements.  Not only do I get a better shave with fewer strokes, but I can even skip a couple days and then cut through the beginnings of a hoary beard with little effort.And even better, the new razors seem to last longer than the Mach 3s, giving half a dozen shaves or more before they need replacement.  The Mach 3s gave up the ghost after just 3 or so.I certainly recommend these razors if the cost is not a huge obstacle, especially if you\'ve got facial hair from hell like I do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5720,2022,20101017,B003983I1S,3,"October 17, 2010",AIO1YA5THH0H1,"Not bad; an improvement in some ways, but not  others.","First up, my history. When I first started shaving, I used a disposable manual razor. Twice. After that, realizing shaving wasn\'t something one could usually get out of by choice, I bought an electric razor, of the rotary type. When the Gillette Mach 3 was introduced, I got that to keep for a backup, or for a closer shave for important events, concerts, shows, etc. Eventually I upgraded my rotary razor to a Braun Pulsonic (expensive) razor. Soon after, I tried the Gillette Fusion Power, to see how it compared. Lets just say it compared just enough to be actually worth comparing. This again went into the cabinet as a special occasional razor. About three months ago, as the cartridge in my Braun Pulsonic was aging beyond it\'s recommended life cycle and the shave was getting less close, and more painful, I decided to try the Gillette Proglides cartridges. I used them on my Gillette Fusion Power handle, since it\'s basically the same as the Proglide handle.Here was my experience with not one but four separate cartridges:I decided to shave at roughly the same time every day, just to get a real good idea of how it performed in relation to my electric. I also shaved the day prior, with my electric.The very first shave was very smooth and close, with no tug and pull, just as advertised. I was surprised, but pleased. It did tend to nick up my face pretty bad, but the blades were sharp enough so it didn\'t affect comfort. I shave well in advance of leaving home, so this wouldn\'t have been a big deal. The second and subsequent shaves were dramatically different from the first one. All were painful, rough, uneven, and frankly not all that close. I was close to just heading back to the Pulsonic with two year (plus) old cartridge, but I decided to stick it out. As the strip of lubricant wore down significantly, the comfort of the shave improved. It wasn\'t as close, but it was almost, if not as comfortable as the first. This lasted until the strip was nearly gone, and it was clearly time to replace.I decided at that point to return to my Pulsonic, and just buy the new cartridge, as it had served me well for two years on one cartridge.A few weeks later, I had an interview, so I bought a three cartridge set of the Proglide cartridges. I decided that after I used the one for the interview, I would use the other two to do a slightly different test.With the final two cartridges, I decided to wait varying periods of time between shaves, so the stubble would be a different length each time.Overall, the results were the same as the first time, with a few differences. Any shave of stubble that was between two days and five days old was much more comfortable and close than it would have been at the same point in the cartridge life cycle with shorter stubble. The longest stubble, which was about six days growth, resulted in a shave that was less close, but as comfortable as the other longer-stubble shaves.I don\'t know whether my rate of stubble growth is typical or atypical, but I can grow a nice goatee in about a week.Overall, I think that Gillette is going in the right direction, but they need to strike a finer balance between shave quality, and longevity of blades in order to make these worthwhile.After all the hype (which I tried to ignore, but who can, really?) I was expecting something different, and much improved. Frankly, even the few times when I turn to a manual razor, I would probably turn to the old Fusion, just because I didn\'t have as many guessing games. It worked until it stopped, which was just before the color from the strip was gone. Even for someone who shaves primarily with a manual razor, unless they have money to blow, I wouldn\'t recommend the Proglide.Overall, my opinion is that this is a debatable improvement over the previous generation, and that it was so far over-hyped that it created false expectations. Had it not been hyped so much as a dramatic improvement, I might have given it four stars, but that type of advertising really irks me.NOTE: This was my experience with the product, and since this sort of product depends a lot on individual faces, hair, shaving habits, etc., it\'s not good to draw a conclusion based solely on a few other reviews. In addition, different people expect different things from a razor. I prefer a balance of longevity, comfort and closeness, while others prefer one over the others. My opinion is: if you\'re an owner of a Fusion handle, you can always get a small pack of the Proglide cartridges and try them out. They may well work differently for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That dullness gets very tiresome, even with the toughest of shaving creams and mixes to make it easier for your best shave.

Probably spent thousands of dollars on these contraptions, and for what??--as I\'ve learned, the shave you get from the cartridge razors is simply not as good as old-fashioned straight razor and safety razor shaves. If you don\'t take yourself seriously as a man and as a connoisseur, than by all means, stick with cartridge razors and waste money to boot. But if you value the lofty experience, the pinnacle of manly class and style, try out traditional shaving.I switched to a safety razor rather than move up to the Proglide. I\'m glad I did.The best shave you can get, of course, is from a professional barber with a profesionally-maintained straight razor. But that\'s an occasional treat, unless you have the time to go to your barbershop every morning and afternoon for shaves (I hope that tradition makes a comeback, though). Maintaining a straight razor at home is time-consuming. And you have to treat shaving with more care and caution, lest you bloody your shower as in a scary horror flick. The good medium compromise is the famous safety razor, which is making a comeback these days. You buy a safety razor handle, made of heavy metal, usually stainless steel. It feels good, heavy, solid in your hand. You buy an inexpensive supply of safety razor blades. Easy to replace, they last about 1-2 weeks per double-sided blade, dependng on beard thickness. Standard safety blades will do you fine, and they\'re much, much less expensive than constantly buying cartridges which clog and wear out quickly (if you want the best safety razor blades, [...] ([...]) has cryo-treated safety blades that last five times as long as regular safety blades, so you save even more money).Then, you buy several shaving soaps and soap dishes, for variety if you like, which are better for your skin than mass-market aerosol shaving gels. The mass-market stuff is junk. Traditional shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful. The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave. I keep five different soaps in my shower in separate bowls so i can switch depending on my mood for scents. You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man\'s lifestyle.Simply put, safety razors and straight razors give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price. And btw, a quality aftershave treatment will also be very good for your skin, it does make a difference. Due to the greater time-consumption of maintaining a straight razor, I suggest trying a safety razor outfit first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That all changed when we received the Fusion Proglide Power Razor.  My  husband is resistant to trying anything new, so it took some nudging to get him to try this.  In the past, he bought whatever was on sale and used it until he hated it and tried something new.  He has very sensitive skin and could not use an electric razor, so he wasn\'t very keen on something that sounded suspiciously like it might be a hybrid of old and new.  Once he used it, he was delighted. In 30 plus years, I have never known his face to be so smooth and free of stubble. This is possibly the best shave he has ever gotten, and it left his skin smooth as a baby\'s face, and in great condition.  The shave was close, smooth, and he actually enjoyed using the razor.  He also told me to leave it alone, and to buy my own!  There are coupons in the papers this week, so I am going to do just that, and buy the one made for women.  This is a really great product.  It fits nicely in the hand, it\'s got an interesting shape, and it does what it promised to do.  I have very sensitive skin, and in the past when he rubbed his face against mine, I got red angry patches on my cheeks.  Not even a hint of it this time, so we are both very pleased with this product.  It seemed to float over his skin, and it left it in the best condition that I have ever seen.  I don\'t think anything would persuade him to going back to his old razors, and in fact, he did throw them out!

So, it goes without saying when I figured I had enough of my face and chin looking like a rocky road I was bound to notice improvements when I picked up this razor, and I did.Quality isn\'t an issue here: the razor looks great, and gives me a very smooth shave. There is also a vibrating function which I choose to use since it eliminates just about any tug I feel on my skin. My shave feels much more comfortable, looks better, and even with 5 blades it works well against my sensitive skin which I already see improving. The precision trimmer edges up nicely for the clean cut look, but after experimenting I also feel it\'s a less risky shave than the main blades around the \'danger zone\' chin and neck area.So now, I got my free razor from Gillette, love it and plan on getting more razors/blades...whats the catch? At almost four bucks a blade for refills, this is simply outrageous and it\'s a dealbreaker for me.

5794,2096,20100610,B003987CL0,5,"June 10, 2010",A2H2I5FY1PUHP1,Five Stars From a Life Long Shick User,"To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.I\'ll begin by saying that I\'ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.ProGlide vs. Hydro 5Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.What\'s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette\'s as a travel holder with no problem.Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro\'s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as \'suspension\' for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.On initial \'hefting\' the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.The Shave TestAll of the above are secondary to the \'Yes, But How Does It Shave\' test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream and a badger bristle brush.Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \'razor burn\' marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \'dried\' she still said the Gillette side was smoother.Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.ProGlide vs QuattroShave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.So what\'s not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn\'t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One AAA battery (included) goes into the handle.  Just press the blue button and you get a vibrating disposable razor.  Very cool, but it doesn\'t seem to make a difference.  For one, the marketing materials included in the package make no claim to any incremental benefit of using the vibrating razor function, only that it turns itself off after 7 minutes.  There are plenty of claims about the thinness of the blades, etc. but nothing about the power function.  In fact, it\'s distracting, and in some cases for me, interferes with the tactile nature of shaving.  Sometimes you need that feel when you\'re hunting for a few whiskers that escaped the first one or two passes.  You don\'t want to redo an area too many times, so you sense by feel where the patch is that needs extra attention.  This razor made me realize how tactile in nature blade shaving can be.As for the rest of the features, I\'m sure Gillette made some incremental improvements but I can\'t tell.  I do think the first shave out of the package was just marvelous.  If I were rich and spendthrift I would only use each blade once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this razor is absolutely wonderful.  I shaved my entire body except for my head and torso and it gave a close shave.  First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  However, once you power it on, the vibration allows it to glide smoothly over your body.  When I shave with my normal razors I always get pin hole knicks all over my body (about 8-15) and come out of the shower bleeding. With this razor, I only had one knick--simply amazing. Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.I also had my boyfriend try it and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily but he could get use to that.

The latest generation of their razors either have huge fans or displeased users. I actually don\'t mind the Fusion line, but I thought it was getting a little too toylike and less useful at times.This model is more of a minor update to what you already have. Should you purchase it if you already have a Fusion, probably not until the razor breaks, or if you are just ready for a new one. The blades have not really felt different, but that it always seems to vary from person to person. So For the cost, this is a good trial, but its not the perfect shave we all desire... yet.

The gaudy styling...this is no Apple product! The battery...uh, what? Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...But, I needed a razor and the introductory price for the razor and blade is cheap and so I one-clicked it.Only had a day\'s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby and I didn\'t have to go over areas twice. Even glided smoothy and efficiently over the adams apple area. Battery on one side, unpowered on the other. Didn\'t notice a difference.Not a hard test, not enough for a review either, so I didn\'t shave for 4 or 5 days and tried it again. Non-powered on the right side, it was a dramatic improvement over previous multi-bladed shavers. Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better. Just a hair easier. It does help with a thick growth, not a noticeable difference to me with an overnight\'s worth. Of course, this will be different for everyone.Is the motor worth it? Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here. Would two or three blades work just as well? Not likely the cost would be much less, so what the heck, the more blades the better. Play with those blades. They really are very different than anything I have seen before.I really don\'t think I can get a better shave. A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly. I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don\'t take much time doing it. The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it. It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.The little trimmer blade works well.This is a highly recommended product, one that actually may make some difference in your life if shaving has been difficult for you. It is new and better technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But if what happens to me happens to you, then it is worth every dime.I have razor bumps on my neck.  I had seen a dermatologist many years ago to ask him why my neck always seems to break out in red bumps.  He pulled a couple of my whiskers to show me the exact reason.  When my whisker grows, it immediately starts to curl inward after it breaks the skin. It then grows back into the skin which causes the red irritation mark. He said this is actually quite common and sometimes called razor bumps, but it is really ingrown whiskers.If I go more than 48 hours without shaving - 2 things happen.  I start to see red bumps all over my neck and worse - more than 1 of them will bleed.After my latest bout with this issue I decided to give this baby a try. Wow, closest shave I have ever had and more importantly - no bleeding.  Since it cuts the whisker so clean, I can also go more than 2 days without shaving.Please note that in my testing, I actually ordered this Power version, and the non-power version.

But for most guys, it simply doesn\'t deliver the closeness the \'old-fashioned\' 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:1) They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  But in the current Proglide commercial, the cartoon is altered to show the second blade doing nothing except scraping the skin, with the hair ending up sticking out above the skin surface.  Major BS here by Gillette.2) If you\'re not comatose, you\'ll notice on their \'Take the Proglide Challenge\' commercials (the one with the used-car salesman guy), they are actually comparing Proglide vs. a DISPOSABLE RAZOR!!!  What does that prove?  How low can Gillette go???Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn\'t totally worthless.  They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  Bottom line is, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  After 2 shaves, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that\'s less close AND less smooth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I WILL LOOK NO FURTHER.","(This is Lisa\'s son speaking.)Shaving has been a frustrating and embarrassing experience for me for years.  There has always been some kind of trade-off between closeness, irritation, tendency to produce ingrown hairs, price, and speed of use.  I never understood how my friends and family members were able to achieve a close and fast shave on a regular basis, while I would shave twice as slowly and get a shave half as good as theirs. I\'ve tried manual razors, electric foil razors, and electric rotary razors.  I had settled on manual razors (only shaving with the grain) because it produced the least irritation and didn\'t leave patches of uncut hairs like all the electric ones I\'ve tried.  Unfortunately, due to my pattern of beard growth, manual razors tended to leave me with ingrown hairs all along my jawline, despite my best efforts to prevent them.  I had figured that I had to settle for dealing with them until now.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best of the manual and electric shaving worlds.

Despite their abundantly mass-produced stock, they have been well-built (some more than others) and have stood the test of time.  These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I\'m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  While Gillette\'s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  Where I know some bumps on my cheeks and chin should be, the vibration may confuse me and cause me to improperly shave and leave some spots thicker than others.The blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I\'m considering doing the ol\'-fashioned wet shaving.All in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cuts my skin, not a close shave, requires too much pressure to bring blades in contact with skin.","I recently discovered Gillette\'s Venus line of razors (I know, they\'ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite). Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \'what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel so I don\'t have to lather up my skin?\'. Apparently, something other than these Venus Spa refills with the shave gel built in.I don\'t know; maybe I just got a bad batch of razor cartridges, but the one that I opened up doesn\'t really release any shave gel until I\'ve moved well beyond a leg or forearm or two. When it DOES release that gel, it\'s more as a concentrated, thin \'string\' of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair. Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger\'s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor\'s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \'lips\' to get the \'teeth\' to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it\'s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades. Just not well executed.I\'d read all of the reviews for the single packs of Venus Spa cartridges, so I knew that there\'d be a 50/50 shot that I\'d actually like these, but putting them into use for myself solidified it for me. You shouldn\'t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that\'s what I feel like I need to get these to work right. As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I\'ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges. At this rate, I\'d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much. THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference. THESE razor cartridges? Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o\'clock shadow every day, and I didn\'t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble! If you like one of Gillette\'s other types of Venus cartridges, stick with those. As has been proven to me before, the grass ISN\'T always greener on the other side! And the stubble may actually be longer!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No matter where you look (Amazon, CVS, etc..), they\'re just pricey.  I wouldn\'t mind it so much except for the fact that one razor doesn\'t last very long.  One razor gives me about 6-7 shaves before it starts scratching and cutting me.  I don\'t know but I just feel they should last longer at this price.  It kind of reminds of \'the printer ink price scam\'.  You know, like when HP sells a great printer for $75 but charges $20 for a single ink cartridge.

But, even though I have no financial reasons constraining my purchase of this example of our \'finest\' technology, I think there could be some misplaced priorities in a society that would spend almost $4 for a razor blade for their razor that vibrates while shaving via a little battery propelled motor.  Do we really need this product to satify our need to look so nice, or could we feed a few more people with the same amount?  Or do we buy it simply because it is the best?  Or, perhaps we need to by this product to assure Gillette makes a fat margin after they pay their marketing people who make up an eight word name for this product (if we count the hyphenated word as two)?  I think men should stop shaving until Gillette finds a way to sell these things for less than $2.  The world would not end if we let our beards grow and reduce their sales to next to nothing.  The worst that would probably happen is they would be forced to sell their company at a huge discount from its current value to a buyer who would pay so little for the company that the blades could be sold for an amount significantly less than $2.  Could we even survuve in a world that no longer produces $4 razor blades?  I bought these blades because they are the best available, but I really do not need the best available.  They really do not do anything of value for me.  I just think it is incredible that we have been sold on the idea that we need a smooth shave.  Now we have guys who shave their heads so they will not reveal their natural loss of hair.  And some guys are shaving their bodies because they think their hair is in the wrong place or their girlfriend or boyfriend do not like hair in the \'wrong\' place.  I think our thoughts are in the wrong place.  I believe we all have the right to appear the way we wish.  But I also have the right to chuckle at my self and others who think $4 razor blades are great stuff.  I rated this product with five stars because it works well, but I reduced it to three stars because it is so unnecessary.  While this is an unnecessary product, it has no real objectionable purpose other than its reflection of how we squander our assets at time when we criticize our government for its outrageous spending choices that are driving our country to financial failure.  In conclusion, do we have the moral authority to demand a like reduction in our wasteful government spending while we continue to buy $4 razor blades.  The answer must only be \'Yes\'.  Our government should not have any control of private spending, but the electorate must have total control of government spending via the House of Representatives even with items of insignificant amounts.  Even though this example is related to razor blades which seem insignificant, our government\'s thinking in this regard is they should be spending as little as possible to accomplish a specific purpose and then only when they have determined that the purpose is one that is worthwhile and necessary.

Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies.  The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing.  They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry.  I can get more than a month of shaves out of a single cartridge before the blades dull and start to nick or pull at the skin.

The shave cannot leave spotty stubble, and the blade can\'t dull after 2-3 attempts either.These Fusions are the best blades I\'ve used for the task. I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face. The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.Even with a week\'s growth on the head, the blade is up to it (granted, I\'m pretty bald, so we\'re not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here). It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that\'s needed.The one flaw is not the blade\'s fault - but it\'s still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you\'re using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.I\'ve cut myself quite a few times, usually on the fingers when I\'m switching hands, or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick. It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot. It can be the kind of cut you\'ll actually need to pay attention too.Other blades can cut too, of course, but this razor\'s series of blades will make it quite a bit worse. If it was just my face, I probably wouldn\'t make the mistake, but since I\'m shaving my head I can\'t always see what I\'m doing, and that can be the problem. I\'ve never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.That is not the blade\'s fault - it\'s mine! But I can\'t imagine I\'m the only one whose done this. I know we\'re all careful with blades, but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.But - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised.

This eliminates razor burn for me and results in a more comfortable shave.I like how the blade assembly follows my face and provides a good shave by keeping the blades at the right angle and in full contact with my skin.  I also like having the one blade side for trimming my mustache and side burns.  The lubricating strip is a nice feature as it improves the gliding motion of the blade head and also acts like a blade wear indicator.  I get a lot of use out of these blades as they seem to me to last longer than other brands and blade designs.Out of all of the types of razors I have used for many years, there is no comparison to the Gillette Fusion.

6286,2596,20060521,B004B8AZH0,1,"May 21, 2006",A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,A big step backwards... don\'t be fooled.,"I began using Gillette\'s Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Encouraged from this experience I ordered these cartridges[ASIN:B004B8AZH0 Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, 12-Count] from Amazon. In fact, I subscribed to receive a supply every six months. These new blades do not shave the way the ealier ones did. There is no comparison. These ones do not glide smoothly, I need to pull the razor and it makes scraping sound! As if I am sharpening a razor on a leather belt! The quality of shave is not at all close and clean and it irritates the skin. I was so much impressed with earlier Gillette experience that I did not contact Amazon immediately and kept trying different blades.... even after 3 or 4 different cartridges still no luck.The mineral oil is missing in the strip. Very poor experience....and I have now decided to return the unused cattridges and cancel my subsciption for future supply.Update : 01/04/2012My earlier experience was with Fusion Proglide!

The last time I was shopping for blades, the ProSkin ones were on sale, so I thought I\'d try them (the ever-rising price on the Venus blades is their downside).The first time I used it, I wound up with about 6 different cuts, several of them bleeding freely.  I chalked it up to the first time.... Next use I still wound up bleeding (though not as badly).  After that I began to use regular shave-gel with the blade (defeating their whole point), and with that I still get razor burn and abrasions, but no bleeding.These blades defeat the very trait I use Venus razors for, and the earlier reviewer is correct-- the \'moisture bars\' fall off after a couple of weeks (maybe 5 or 6 uses in my case), making them no bargain (I can use the regular blades for a month or more each).The DO shave closely and leave skin smooth, but are not worth the trade-off in discomfort and blood.My advice is skip these and get any of the other blades in the line-- I\'ve tried them all at different times and they all work better than the ProSkin ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s triple blade design seems like overkill, I mean really, I can get just as close of shaves with a classic DE safety razor, and have less razor burn. If you haven\'t learned already, more blades dragging across the surface of the skin means increased chance for razor burn, it\'s just that simple. So while this razor is less prone to give razor burn than the 4 and 5 blade designs, it\'s still going to be worse than a 2 or single blade design. We\'re talking about human body hair here, we\'re not using it to shave an angora rabbit.The 3 blades are spaced well enough apart that they don\'t easily clog, and rinse very easily. The handle is nicely contoured and easy to hold without slippage at most any angle, and is textured enough not to be slippery when all soapy. Speaking of soapy, those little goo-bars on the razor are awful. They turn to slime, clear slime like when you blow your nose with a bad head-cold. It\'s just stringy and disgusting looking. They also do little to help the blades glide over wet skin. I ended up with the worst razor burn I\'ve ever had by trying to use this razor on wet skin. Once I went back to foaming up my legs with a super-slick tallow shaving soap, I was able to get irritation free shaves.The little goo bars don\'t last past 4 shaves for me before they\'re gone. They don\'t last nearly as long as the blades stay sharp. Cost-wise I\'m not thrilled either, with the price of the cartridge refills.

I have to say though that I\'m quite impressed with how easy it was to use this Gillette Venus razor and how well it worked.There is no need for any shaving cream or gel at all - the moisturizing bars that encase the razor do an excellent job of providing the traction you need once they get wet, they leave a very slick almost gooey path along the surface of your skin as you go along.Overall I found this super-easy to use, I was able to shave my legs in much less time.  The only drawback I found was that I don\'t think I was able to shave quite as close as I normally am able to when using a plain razor and shaving cream.  I found after when running my hands across the surface of my legs when they were dry that they weren\'t quite as smooth, but it was still definitely a very good job and a great time-saver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This razor works just as well as they do. They glide smoothly over my skin, and leave my legs feeling soft. The only thing they seem to have changed is the razor holder, and I do NOT like it.The old razors came with a large holder that sticks to the shower wall and opens up to hold two spare razor heads. This new holder is MUCH smaller and suctions to the wall. You just slide the neck of the razor into the holder, and that\'s it. I\'m not sure why they changed this. I would think wall space in the shower isn\'t really something most people are trying save, and now, your spare razor heads have to be kept outside of the shower. To some this may not be a big deal, but I ALWAYS change to a new razor head while I\'m in the shower.Overall, I still love the razor and the job it does, but the new holder design is, IMO, no good. I ended up throwing it out and using the one I already had.

I\'m always sure to rinse it off good and give it a really good shake before I put it away to make sure it\'s mostly dried off. I don\'t store the razor in the shower where the water will hit it constantly or it would eat away the moisture bar in no time. I shave my legs every other day and this razor seems to do a really good job at shaving close and keeping my legs looking good for the time between shaving.

My 20 year old Con-air trimmer does better due to more power (2 AA batteries as opposed to 1 AA battery for the styler).

The back of the 5-blade razor has a \'precision edging blade\' that lets you precisely shape and edge your sideburns.  Sometimes, depending upon how much I have let my sideburns grow out, I find it easier to just use the powered trimmer without either the razor or comb attachments and using the trimmer by itself does a great job of shaping my sideburns with crisp clean lines.

Once I got over the shock of the gigantic sized cartridge, I was okay.What comes in the package:  One handle, one cartridge and a suction holder (which didn\'t stay suctioned anywhere in my bathroom).The handle: Is smooshy and has a soft gel-like grip.  I loved this.  It doesn\'t slip around in the shower and fits nicely in my hand.The cartridge: Did I mention this was huge?  I was trying to find a common object to compare it to.  I ended up using money. The cartridge is almost as wide as two quarters.  There is still portions on left uncovered above the quarters. The razor itself has 5 blades-nice.  On either side of the blade is an Olay bar-which is what makes this so huge.  I\'m assuming these will shrink with use.The shave: I was not brave enough to use this without soap on my legs.  I usually just squeeze shower cream into a bath puff and lather my legs. So, I don\'t use a thick lather...just enough to help the razor glide and not give me razor burn.  I did notice that there was an improved smoothness to the shave.  Even with my usual shower cream, there was not a big lather. For me, this is a plus. For others, the lack of shaving cream/gel thickness may take some getting used to.The shave was close. My skin was smooth afterwards.  It even did well under my arms.  Now, if you were to use this anywhere between your underarms and your legs, there may be issues since the cartridge is gigantic. This is a bummer.The cartridge refills run about five dollars each.  A bit pricy but if you are no longer buying shaving cream, the cost evens out.  The plus is that you can use the refills on any Venus handle (per the product description of the replacement cartridges).  However, this handle is better than the Venus handles I\'ve used in the past, but if you have a handle...it\'s nice to know you\'re not being forced to buy a new one. Brownie points for Gillette.The front of the package has a sticker guarantee that states \'Love it or 2x money back\'.  My final thought for this review is: If I would have paid for this product, would I take advantage of the guarantee?  My answer is no.  Although the size of the cartridge is what is keeping me from giving this 5 stars, the bars on the cartridge are superior to the nasty little sticky moisturizing strips on other razors.  The shave was good.  If purchased on sale, it would be an excellent buy.I will update my review to note how long the bars last on the one cartridge that I have (shaving every other day...down from my previous daily OCD shave).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was so light.  I ran my hand down the length of my leg and it was soooo smooth!  The contour pivoting head was so awesome as well.  I have knobby type knees and this thing just glided over them like it was skiing the Alps.  Then I gave it the ultimate challenge.  I hadn\'t tended to the bikini area for awhile so I gave that a go.  This razor just took care of all the business there like it was baby fine hair (which it was NOT).I like the fact that it comes with a suction cup razor holder but be sure to place this strategically in your shower or bathtub so no water runs directly on it because it will lose suction and you don\'t want to have water pouring over the Olay moisture bars.  I have used this razor for at least two weeks now (a total of 8 times) and the moisture bar does not look to have dwindled in size at all.  The blades (5 of them!) still seem ultra sharp.I definitely recommend this razor and honestly...I might toss the Mach one in the trash and use this baby full time.
