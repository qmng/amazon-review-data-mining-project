The refills that came with it lasted similarly long.Then I bought refills, and each blade was dull within a week and a half.About two years ago, I found a place on the Web that sold cryonically-treated razor cartridges (you can Google for \'cryogenically tempered Mach 3 razor\').  They were slightly more expensive than most Web retailers, but they last at least three times as long... I\'m just now running out of them (I think I bought 32, and gave eight to my dad).Anyway, I only posted this because these cartridges popped up as the top recommendation on my home page.  Weird.    "
17,17,20040408,B000052YHR,3,"April 8, 2004",A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,Great innovation from Gillette," now surpassed by Turbo The Mach III was a great piece of innovation from Gillette - there are quite a few upgrades here from the last of its double blade releases, the Sensor Excel.  The Mach III is the first time I felt like I could shave rather absent-mindedly (it is first thing in the morning, after all) and not endanger my face.The issue is that the Mach III has been surpassed by the so-called \'Mach III Turbo\' product release from Gillette.  The naming of that product is unfortunate - \'Turbo\' sounds like some marketing affectation, when in fact it honestly provides you with a vastly superior shaving experience.  Despite the rather obscene price point of the Turbo, I\'d suggest you skip the \'Mach III\' and move up.  I\'m convinced you can get more shaves out of it and make your money back.  Plus, it\'s just a better shave.   "

It doesn\'t hurt nearly as much. there is less \'pull\' when shaving, which, prior to this purchase was a very painful experience. And while it does reduce the amount of pull, it doesn\'t completely eliminate it, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. For me, its good enough for now.    "

God forbid I miss a spot there and have to go back over it because when I do, I can count on an irritated, red upper lip that dries and flakes after a short while. I\'ve never had that problem before this. Now I have to buy sensitive skin shave cream. How I miss my old Gillette Sensor Excel. Two blades that did the job.

These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.I don\'t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it\'s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I\'ve never had any problems with the handle, and I\'ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.This particular deal for one razor and two cartridges at $3.19 is a great deal.  Get it at this price!    "

This is Gillette\'s older model you can get the new stuff for the same money. I found a NIB set of 15 blades for $3 at a yard sell and needed a handle for them that is why I bought this.    
47,50,20080313,B000052YHS,2,"March 13, 2008",A2QMXIFIVE4LNS,The best expensive mediocre shave a man can get.,"Mediocre and Overpriced, March 13, 2008By  supernatural (Illinois) - See all my reviewsUnfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems. It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.    "

THe lub strip goes, and the blades start to go too.And don\'t tell me to switch to Mach 3 Turbo....even as much of a waste, although the lube strip stays on longer. Not worth it.Ah, Mach 3.

The razor is held at a different angle than I\'m used to, but after adjusting to that I found it very easy to use. A third blade initially sounded like a sales gimmick, but it really makes a big difference in the razor\'s performance.    "

I rate it 4 stars just because its not as wonderful as some of the other venus razors, but thats why its a bit cheaper. I knew that before I bought it. There is not much of a difference in the closeness of the shave but more so in shaving; the venus embrace has these moisture strips so after the first time (it takes time for the water to soak in) you don\'t even have to use shaving cream for the next several times till the moisture strips wears out. However, I am not sensitive when it comes to shaving and have no problem using shaving cream (hair conditioner) and the shave is almost as close as any other venus.

But to be honest with you theres no way your blue strip goes away that quick to where it would require 10 times a month!  you must be shaving your whole body, legs, arms and face!  i shave my face daily, and if i went off of the blue strips then i would be stupid!  because my blue strips last longer then what i feel is the life span of one of these blades.  i go through about 2 blades a month and each blade ive thrown out has the blue strip still but it was faded some what.  yes i have seen the blue strip completely disappear as well.back to the review though.  i would really encourage people to opt for the turbo vs the original or even the vibrating one!  original is cheap  yes, but the turbo feels better on sensitive skin, and the virbrating one i think its a waste of money!

I put off buying the mach 3 for some time, because it is a bit pricer. But let me tell you what. I wish I would have got one A LOT SOONER!! The price differance is not much worse, if you buy the new razors online at Amazon. The handle on this thing has much more style, and is a lot more attractive than the sensor 3 and really has a nice precise feel, in your hand. It shaves incredibly close, and does an excellent job, going againest the grain! You look forward to shaving, which is something that never happened before. And you feel like a million bucks when you are done! I have already ordered a champion one with the red and black color scheme, because I\'m a Chicago Bulls fan. My opinion, this is prabably the best bang for buck on the market. The other systems with more blades and even fancier designs are WAY to expensive, unless you are just looking to toss money away!

Yeah, I remember. What a sensation! What a shave! What a waste of money. The expensive Mach 3 line has practically surpassed every razor out there in quality shaving and design. But it will never surpass the meaning of the word \'deal\'. And now, just a couple of years back, we were introduced to the Mach 3 TURBO, the special edition of a Mach 3 razor. Hmmm, silver all the way through. Shiny! Very dashing. Wow.....shaves well too, now that the three blades are coated to reduce friction. That\'s a relief! The razor has an evil price tag of about $11 canadian, and the razor cartridges go for about $10 for 4, or $19 for 8. I guess the Gillette head honchos needed a new fleet of \'Porsche Boxter\' convertibles and a few yachts. Well, if they get us to spend the money on their stuff, then we\'ll make them look richer than real estate dumbbell Tom Vu and Sly Stallone put together. I love a good, comfortable, gash free shave. And the Mach 3 is a terrific razor to get this wonderful shave I look forward to every morning. Mind you, the Mach 3 Turbo is just....well, too good of a razor. Kind of like an oversensitive Ferrari sport steering system. It\'ll get to every corner and turn...with scary precision. So, anti-friction coating or not, it\'s a serious blade. Yesterday, I went and bought the less expensive Schick Extreme 3, and even with it\'s three blades, it gives me a shave nearly as close as the Mach 3. Okay, so that\'s an A- shave, and not an A+. Still, the \'Extreme\' is a terrific razor, cuts the hairs well without leaving me the feeling that I have to be \'so\' careful with it, and is a much more reasonable price for both the razor and blade cartridges than the mighty Mach 3. Sigh. What\'s this world coming to? All this wasted money spent to find a razor that\'s a good price and gives you a great shave. Yeah....guess you could say that recently, I went to extremes. (groan) I know, I was never good at jokes.    "

I will cut myself into a million pieces with the cheap disposable blades, and even previous versions of the mach 3 blade still left my skin irritated.  Now that the m3 power has come out, the shave is so much less irritating and, when combined with m3 power shave gel, it performs even better! The green lubrication strip is amazing! The blades just glide right over the skin with the new addition, however I typically find that the lubrication only lasts me 2 shaves, and then it starts to nick up my skin. The blades break down to about $1.00 a piece, which turns out to be $0.50 per shave for me (for the blade product alone, not incuding shave cream, new batteries, etc.), which is a bit high. The blade is great but the price is a lot. If you are willing to spend the extra money for a great shave, I have not found a better razor.UPDATED: The Gillette Fusion Power blades are even better than this product. At the time when I wrote this review, Fusion had not even been released. After using Fusion Power, I cannot return to this product any longer. Fusion provides an even LESS irritating shave to my skin that the M3 Power did, and seems to trim quicker and slide smoothly across my face with the proper shaving cream.

I will tell you why:1) The fusion has such a big head that there are some places that it simply can not go, I know that it has the blade on the back for those hard to reach places but that is only one blade - the Mach 3\'s head is much smaller and can get the whole head in those hard places.2)  Cost - why pay more gilette seems to think we want to pay more.3) Wilkerson Corp said it best when the company said \'the simple addition of one blade does not necessarily make for a better shave.\'  Only if things in life were that simple.Had Gilette not sent me the free Mach 3 I would have probably never known about it and stayed with the more expensive model.

The hair washes off under the tap (means faucet for those who didn\'t understand \'tap\'), no struggling required.Expensive as it is (like other reviewers have observed as well), I\'m not going back to the Mach 3 that I used earlier. and certainly never to the Sensor excel I used before that. No regrets at all.definitely definitely recommended...    "

The shave is close, smooth and free from razor burn. The lack of razor burn is remarkable with a new blade.But the extra single-blade is another matter altogether.  Because the main 5-blade setup is so big, some provision had to be made for tight spots like under the nose.  It\'s an old-fashioned single blade. I really don\'t remember when I last used a single blade.  I think that\'s why I dislike shaving. Oww, yes, it\'s that old-time razor burn in spades.So after any shave you can contrast the burn beneath your nose with the smooth, closely-shaved, unharmed skin on the rest of your face.After their big-buck R & D efforts, Gillette needs a way to solve this.(Or use a Mach III under your nose and the new Fusion  on the rest of your beard.)BTW, somehow they seem to have solved the clogged-blade problem that haunted the 4-bladed Shick Quattro.

Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other \'detail\' parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front.  It just doesn\'t work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use.

So if it tugs the hair, you should probably use a  better shaving cream.Now the things I wish were better about the razor:The blades have a lubricating strip on them that works wonderfully at first and,  after one or two shaves, the strip turns white and loses its lubrication. For the price, its not like you\'re going to throw it away after one shave. The other factor is that the price of the replacement blades borders on rediculous. This is supposed to be inexpensive hygiene tool like a toothbrush or under arm deodorant. These blades cost more than both of them combined. Doesn\'t make sense to buy the blades when it is just as expensive to let my barber do it for me. The razor itself is decently priced. I would love this product if blades were cheaper.    "

The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months.... You have to admit, that\'s money well spent.I\'ve used all types of blades starting when I was 15...single, double, triple edge blades...Electric shavers, clippers, and even depilatories(which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it, spread it on, wait for it to cure, scrape it off, and wash the excess off my face).

When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it\'s hard to continue shaving when there\'s hair worsening the blades\' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick.

I also have the 3 blade power model which is another bad joke unto itself.  I still have to go over and over the same area, shave from different angles over the same space and it takes just as long and gives no better shave.  True it was a nice touch to add the precision trimmer blade to the top side but I\'m not sure that justifies the cost either.

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.    "

I pictured the coroner finding my severed head in the shower, this thing clutched in my hands, \'air raid\' scrawled on the shower in blood.

I found that due to it\'s size it did need fixing on a curve or two, but overall I was very impressed. I have been using Gillette disposable up till now. So it has impressed my skin, but now it has to make peace with my wallet. It all boils down to how long the blades last. I expect at least a week out of each. Usually those green \'lube\' strips are the first to go and after that the razors become pretty brutal. AT this price point I don\'t want to use more than one blade every week. If  they can manage that and send me some coupons then I am sold. But I think 5 blades is the stopping point- anything beyond that needs a pull starter.    "
551,571,20060905,B000BUUVTE,2,"September 5, 2006",A3J6GVLYFFCVGB,Not for thick beards,"Let\'s get this straight from the beginning:  I hate shaving.  I have a very thick beard that grows very fast -- if I shave first thing in the morning, I actually need a shave again by 5 o\'clock.  And I have to go over every area at least twice to get a close shave.  I spend an inordinate amount of time doing something that I hate.  So, I will gladly try any new product that promises to make shaving a bit easier.With five blades, the Fusion looked to be the holy grail of shaving.  I\'ve been using a Mach 3 for years, and it works better than just about anything else (though my Panasonic linear electric is great in its own right).  I figured if three blades are good, five should be better.  Right?Well, unfortunately not.  The five blades on the Fusion are on a head about the same size as the Mach 3, which only has three blades.  This means the blades on the Fusion are much closer together, which Gillette says will give you a closer shave.  This might be true for average beards, but if you have a thick beard, the blades are actually TOO close together.  I find that the Fusion just kind of skips over my whiskers without cutting, especially if I shave with the grain.  So, I actually have to spend a longer time shaving with the Fusion than I did with the Mach 3, and I have to go against the grain more often.  I\'ve switched back to the Mach 3.However, one thing I really do like on the Fusion is the single blade on the back.  That is really excellent for shaving those hard to reach areas under the nose, and for straightening out sideburns.  I just hope they come out with a Fusion Platinum Edition or something, with a bigger razor head that spreads the blades out a bit more.    "

I used it for almost 3 months before having to bite the bullet and buy cartridges.The shave from this razor is incredibly close, with no irritation. My beard grows every which way, leading to some discomfort with single or twin blade cartridges. This shaver, while refills can be expensive, provided a closeness in the shave I have never experienced before.I have achieved a longer use per refill, partly I think, because I do not use a traditional shave cream. I use \'Kiss my Face\' shave cream, which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge, while also providing a better and closer shave, with far less irritation.If you use this, try different shave creams, and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses. This will help to lengthen the life of the cartridges.One caveat... my beard is not thick, and I do sport a goatee, which may also help with longevity of cartridges.

I smell noble price here!Don\'t let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn\'t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the \'adding more blades\' thing is getting exhausted.    "
589,610,20061024,B000BUUVTY,5,"October 24, 2006",A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,Best shaver I\'ve ever had.,"I\'m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.    "

I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless.  Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head.  When compared to the Mach3 which you had to use for this area the closeness is not even in the same league.  That\'s my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I\'ve used.  My only con is how damn expensive the blades are.  I\'m trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that\'s about the best I can do. That works out to about $6 a month just to shave.  I\'m going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices.

Some have thick fast-growing hair, some thin slow-growing, some medium thickness fast growing, etc. Everyone\'s different. Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don\'t need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it\'s what works for them.So far, these Fusion Power\'s are the best for me. My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors. The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3\'s came out, and the Mach3\'s were equally tossed when the Fusion Power\'s arrived. The reason - the 2 blades hurt, I cut myself lots, and wore out in one or two uses. Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut. These Power Fusions However, I must emphasize: *have yet to cut me*. I think the vibrate function is to thank for this, but I\'ve yet to cut myself when the battery runs out either, so it may just be the blade.Here\'s what Gillette does not want you to know though: these things last a LONG time. You can use one blade for months with minimal degradation of the blade quality, as long as you use the vibrate function and cream. How do I know they don\'t want you to know this? Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they\'d like, and so there\'s a whole marketing bend they\'re on about checking your indicator strips to see if it\'s time to replace. My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn\'t as quickly disposable.That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me. No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I\'m barely buying one pack a year.    "

Just got off the phone with Amazon no problem getting refund and getting free shipping label to send back. Yet will never buy razor blades from any store online again. Dont have the time to do the research if they are knock offs or no I just know from my experience with the ones from Amazon that they are way to sharp and cut up my neck and face even though I first wet my face with hot water then wait a couple minutes for shaving cream to settle into skin and shave the exact way I always do which never caused cuts with the blades I buy locally. Who knows whats up I will stick to buying my razor blades from the local retailers.Update: I contacted Amazon about this product. I hate to do this but because these are fakes I told them they will be shipped to Proctor and Gamble\'s counterfeit department for inspection. The reason I am doing this is because first of all the fake blades I received give a painful shave and I just cant allow fellow buyers to be deceived the way I was. So hopefully Amazon will either sell real ones or Procter and Gamble will peruse legal action. The bottom line is buyers like myself would gladly pay the couple extra dollars you would at Wal Mart rather then be deceived and being sold fake blades. And yes Amazon did refund my money but the procedure when you receive a counterfeit product is not to return it to the merchant first you should contact the company who makes the actual product then local and state attorney departments and the better business beuero. If I wanted fake razor blades I would have purchased them off of Ebay. Grow up Amazon and quit trying to trick people!!

The blades felt like they were scraping too closely against my skin and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience, without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.A year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!) instead of buying a new razor altogether. The experience was completely different from what I remembered! The razor just glided over my skin, I never felt like I had to go back over areas, it was incredibly comfortable, and, most importantly, an extremely close shave!Surprised, I wondered what it could be, and realized that it might be the blades making the difference. I picked up some Fusion Power replacements and tried them side by side and it confirmed for me - the Fusion Power blades are markedly worse than the regular Fusion blades.Don\'t believe me? Give it a shot yourself, I think you\'ll find that the best combo is to buy a Fusion Power razor and regular Fusion blades.Good luck!    "

I thought I was the only one who noticed this and switched to a Braun electric razor but if you read the other reviews you\'ll see that other men have done this as well.I got the Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver for $199.99 about a year ago, and periodically (right now for example) you can get $50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $130.00. So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I\'m def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need. I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream (have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $40.00 for a years worth) and I never get irritated skin anymore.So now I spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 = $225.00 for the first year and a half I\'ve used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing= $565.00So Gillette Fusion, or comparable manual razors, cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor.

I\'m not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick.  I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it.  Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out.  I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades.

Nice Shaver!,"If you suffer from folliculitis, this may just be the razor you were waiting for! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.Also, I bought the Power model but am not sure yet which mode I like best: power or manual. But since you can choose whether or not to turn the power on or not, buying the power model seems best to me. You can get the best of both worlds!In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.    "

BUT, this thing has one blade too many in the front, this razor WILL CUT YOU if you are not careful! You could probably kill someone with it! The blades on the cartridges are extremely sharp and shaving time increases to over twice the time as with the Gillette M3, due to that extra fourth blade and the size of the cartridge, which forces you to be extra careful and shave very slowly, so as not to cut yourself. If it only had one less blade in the front, it would certainly be the best razor in the world! Gillette, if you are reading this, consider this advise seriously and remove that fourth blade, because you created one hell of a scalpel. I am rating it two stars, despite the many pluses already mentioned, but since its primary and only purpose is to shave, I cannot honestly say it does a good job. I\'ve used disposable razors that are about $0.49 cents that are faster and better. I do not recommend it, unless they remove that fourth blade.

I\'ve been using it for a month now and there\'s no sign of a low battery.My only complaint - and this is a complaint about the disposable razor industry and all industries built on this model (ink jet printers anyone?) - is that the blades cost waaaay too much. $14 for 4 blades is criminal.

I have pretty thick facial hair, though it is not especially fast-growing (no big problems with five o\'clock shadow and I only shave every two or three days - though on day three, I\'m pretty grizzled). The Fusion gave me the closest shave ever - especially on my neck around the Adam\'s apple, which is an always-difficult area. I usually find a few stray stubbles, even with my Mach3 Power that I\'ve been happily using for quite some time, but today my neck was smooth and clean with no \'re-do\'.The five blades of the Fusion are closer together and thus occupy about the same amount of space as the three blades of the Mach 3.  This results in a very smooth feel to the shave - you don\'t feel the five separate blades, just one shaving surface.  I did feel some tugging on the heaviest parts of my beard (I hadn\'t shaved since Sunday morning).I also found I didn\'t need to go back to \'re-shave\' certain areas.  My facial hair is pretty dense and there are certain spots on my upper cheeks, directly under my jaw and on my neck that I tend to miss or just don\'t get a close shave on the first go-round.  This wasn\'t a problem with the Fusion.The extra sixth blade works exactly as described and is a fantastic addition.  I was able to easily (and accurately) straighten out my sideburns and get those few stray and hard-to-get-at hairs under and next to my nose.Overall, I\'m very impressed.  I recognize that there is a certain amount of hype surrounding new introductions from Gillette - but it seems like they really do their homework.  When they first came out with Mach3 Power, it seemed like a gimmick - but I found it gave me a closer and more comfortable shave.  Now, with the Fusion, it feels like another leap forward in shaving technology...  I\'m sold and give the Fusion Power my unqualified recommendation.    "

I hated shaving every other day as I found the shave quite uncomfortable. But with my ever increasing stubble, I wanted to find an alternative.I found this one at Kroeger and decided to give it a try. I was very impressed with the shave, it was very smooth and much more comfortable than any two blade razor. What was most impressive was it cut far less than the other razors. The turbo option doesnt really improve the shaving experience though and so I shave without the turbo power. I do have to shave on the same spots again but I do not feel any discomfort as compared to the other razors. The trimming blade too is useful especially when working on the sideburns and underneath the neck, but it takes some time to figure out the \'correct\' way of holding the handle in this position.But alas, all good things have a price and this one might be too expensive in the long run. I will have to see how many shaves my blades last to get the economics right.In short, if you are still stuck with two blades and want to move to better options, I highly recommend this razor if you can afford the blades in the long run.

However, the blue strip does wear out after about 4 days, but I continue to use it for a few more. I had used the Mach 3 Power razor for several years and the new Fusion Power is the best shave yet. I had similar results with the Mach 3 blades lasting about 5 to 7 shaves.I usually let me face have a rest on the weekend from all the shaving during the week, and I haven\'t stopped that tradition. For the past two weekends I skipped a day and shaved on Sunday or Monday morning.The razor has had no problems shaving through two days of growth. I have thick stubble by day two and the shave is as good as ever. The razor doesn\'t get clogged and can be cleaned out easily.I\'m getting use to the new precision trimmer on the back of the razor to shave under my nose and side-burns. I\'m more impressed with the results than I was on day one, but not as I am with my old Sensor razor, which is what I still find myself using for those hard-to-reach areas.I\'ve been using Gillette products for 17 years. I started with the Sensor and have bought and used every razor Gillette has made since! I have \'em all!The price is high, I\'ll admit it! But I think I\'m going to stick with the New Power Fusion for now. I still have some of the Mach 3 Power blades I need to use so once those are gone, I\'ll be strictly using the Fusion Power Razor.One other thing to consider is the kind of shaving cream or gel you use. I\'ve noticed that the better, \'more expensive\' ones provide a better feeling during and after a shave. I currently use Gillette\'s Shaving Gel, but I want to try the new Fusion Hydra Gel. I also want to try the King of Shaves gel. I\'ve also found the Neturogena razor defense post shave lotion to be a great product!Ultimately, the razor looks good and feels good in your hand. The shave is great and I\'m hooked!    "

I mean, really, if you\'re a man and you\'re reading this, you probably already own/use Gillette products.  It\'s a given.  They really are the best.  They are also really the MOST EXPENSIVE.I used the regular Gillette Fusion for years now - and just made the \'leap\' to get the Fusion Power.  Why now?  I mean the blades are ridiculously expensive as it is, what\'s another buck or two on top of that?!Tried it for the first time today.  It works well.  The vibrating is a bit weird - it\'s like a hand massage while you shave.  Shaving doesn\'t feel like shaving.  That vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with.  It certainly is painless to use.  It worked well - my skin is smooth.  No telling if it\'s smoother than the regular Fusion.  How could you tell?  I don\'t know if it\'s a gimmick or what - but I did like it.  I\'ll continue to use it, since I bought the darn thing and have no choice.~ EDIT 4/23/2010:  I now hate this thing.  Here\'s why: Within one or two shaves, the \'lubricating strip\' is completely gone.  After that first shave with a nice new blade, it hurts like hell to shave with.  It\'s as if the vibrating effect speeds up the wear and tear on the blades!  It\'s horrible.  It truly is.  On the weekends, after a couple days growth, shaving with this thing is horrendous - I\'ve never had a more painful shave.  The vibrating thing is just a gimmick: aside from that first shave with a new blade, it\'s not nearly as good as the other non-vibrating shaving razors out there.  I find areas all the time that it just did a horrible job on - rough spots.  I can\'t use it on my upper lip - because the vibrating makes my lips chap!  Even turned off, shaving HURTS with this thing!  I\'m throwing it out.  I had this old spare new Schtick razor I keep around and shaved with that a few days ago - WOW.  It\'s awesome!  So smoooooth.  The vibrating thing is a total sham, folks.    "

But about a year ago I decided to test razors. Everything I could get my hands on. Even vintage razors from the early 20th century.I didn\'t want to like this razor.However, it along with its Mach 3 cousins are damn good razors. Easily the best I\'ve handled. And anybody that says it isn\'t is either crazy, or is being disingenuous.Are 5 blades really necessary (is a Cadillac necessary compared to a Dodge Neon)? Get what you pay for I guess.If you want the best, smoothest shave on planet earth with minimum irritation and you don\'t want to spend more time in the bathroom tending to your face than your wife? Then this is your razor.If you want to shave with a piece of flint, save a few bucks and thumb your nose at the system? Not my problem. Will lesser razors shave your face? Yep, especially if you like nicks, cuts, razor burn, multiple passes, shaving against the grain, re-shaving, $20 shaving creams, $80 shave brushes, pre-shave oils, soothing aftershaves, witch hazel, styptic sticks, hanging out on internet forums wondering what you\'re doing wrong, etc... And if you can find the economy in that, let me know.Did I mention this razors performance in more private areas? Nothing even comes close. And electric personal groomers are poor in performance by comparison.As for the cost, for me this is a non-issue. I can get months out of one cartridge relatively easily and with a little common sense that seems abundant out here in the woods, less so in the city. Therefore, this and other razors of its type (Mach 3 innovation) are no more expensive to me than a \'classic\' double edged razor which I have as well. It stays in the drawer mostly. But easily accessible if I suddenly need to go back in time, or remember why at one time why most men grew beards.    "

I have a dark, fast growing, above average thickness bristles with average density.Slightly closer shave than the M3 Power, of little difference if you have a lighter hair or beard.  I found I could shave a little faster with this blade.Slightly less comfortable for me: the blades pull my hair just a little, the vibration is a little too strong (I\'m somewhat sensitive to vibration in my right hand) and I found the handle more likely to get slippery in the shower vs. the M3 Power.I found the trim blade to be a good addition for under the nose and sideburns.

First, I am not a complainer or nutcase - I am a 58 year old businessman who needed a new razor and had a coupon. I bought the 5-blade Fusion vibrating razor for that reason only - I had a coupon.As Gillette has apparently figured out, 5 blades is a dumb idea because it is so wide you can\'t negotiate those tight places around the nose, etc. To account for this - rather than addressing the actual problem they added a single \'trimmer\' blade to the opposite side. Brilliant!Well, I can not remember the last time I actually CUT myself with a razor until this razor came along.  Twice in transitioning from my neck to chin I have managed to drag the trimmer blade across my chin laying it open the entire width of the blade!  Not a nick, mind you, but a freakin\' wound!  Sure, I could continue to use it and just \'be more careful\' but that would be wrong. There are too many better products on the market for me to make allowances for crappy and dangerous design.Two major cuts in the same spot and I now have an actual scar.

It is handy for shaving tricky spots such as the area under the nose and between the upper lip. That being stated, I have not noticed a more comfortable shave with the micro pulses. Also, five blades has not reduced the number of required strokes when compared to the three on the Mach3 Turbo (the number of strokes is the same). Finally, the frequency of having to replace the cartridges does not justify their cost. After only three shaves, the cartridge needs to be changed. The blades for the Mach3 and Sensor product lines last longer. If you shave daily, do not upgrade to this.    "

It definitely didn\'t give me a very close shave, nor did it make me feel manly.I had never cut myself shaving until I used this razor.

If there is an improvement, it\'s negligible. Its head\'s a little bigger than the Mach-3 as well, which isn\'t a HUGE deal but it noticeable enough. I have used both side by side, and can safely say that both will give you a fantastic shave. It is also a cool looking blade. The battery-powered operation is just gimmicky and doesn\'t improve your shave a great deal.    "

It gets reasonably close and is pretty smooth until you find it is time to replace the cartridge. This is where you hit a brick wall. $26.00 for a pack of cartridges is really one of the more ludacris ideas I\'ve heard in a while. I get just as good a shave with a Bic disposable single blade so five blades really isn\'t better. Hell, THREE blades is unecessary (and two can be downright painful). I have purchased a Mercur safety razor which I think will hold me over for a good forty years as it is a tried and true antiquity, is a single blade, and the said blades cost like a buck for ten at Longs (standard double edge). Horrendous value cartridge-wise and not really a terribly good shave to boot. I really should probably have given it a one star, but hey, it works. If you\'re under eighteen, wait \'till they send you a free promotional one (they most likely will). If you\'re over, I highly recomend you stray from this series. If you like Gillette, get the Good Ol\' Mach tres. Or, go smart, frugal (and coincidentally eco friendly), and purchase a safety razor.  Good hunting.  The Great Gonzo    "

First impressions meet all the rave reviews - and I did not get the snagging of others.  A slightly better shave than unpowered fusion or mach 3 but OK.  I have now had the battery run out.  Razor runs for 5 seconds with flashing light then stops.  Check battery - not down in power but swap for new one - razor runs for 5 seconds with flashing light then stops.  That\'s it - I now have an unpowered fusion with a thicker handle for several $ more.  I doubt I will spend the $ required for more cartridges I can buy a new mach3 and blades for the same price.This is a disposable razor masquerading as a real razor - I wondered why many stores here were not selling the cartridges.

This is one of my rare exceptions.  So why am I do ing this?  Last April I developed a blood clot in my right calf as well as a small one just above my knee.  As is usual in these cases, I was placed on the anticoagulation medicine Warfarin (the generic form of Coumadin) for six months.  This past saturday I was officially taken off Warfarin.Why do I bring all this up?  I was told in April that I was going to have to be very careful not to cut myself shaving.  If I did, I might have a great deal of trouble stopping the bleeding.  I had bought this razor literally the week before my blood clot.  I had been using the Mach 3 before this and often cut myself using it.  I was somewhat dubious about using this new razor and its five blade, but I liked the very, very close shave it gave me.  So I stuck with it.  The result?  In six months I did not cut myself a single time.  This is far and away the best razor I\'ve ever used.  It gives an amazingly close shave and protects my skin from scraping or cutting better than anything I\'ve ever used.So thanks Gillette for not making me find out what cutting myself when shaving would have been like.

After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn\'t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades?

If you leave your face unshaved for more than 3 days... like a full weekend.  It doesnt shave as well.  The long hairs get caught up in the blades and almost rip out.  The Mach 3 does a much better job at long hairs.  It is possible to shave with the fusion, but it takes a longer time since you have to keep rining it out every inch of a shave.I had this razor since the first day it came out.  The best thing  I have noticed is that each blade lasts about 2 weeks. My Mach 3 usually lasted a week.  ( Like i said i have senstive skin and once the blade starts going, my face gets all cut up. )  So blades are more expensive but they do last longer.Overall.  Best razor every if you need to shave frequently.  If you are a contruction worker or someone that only shaves once or twice a week... I wouldnt recommend it.    "

And blades last a very long time, which was my concern, since they are more expensive than Mach 3 ones. We both could not be happier with Fusion Power Razor.    "

First the lubricant strip is much larger than the earlier Gillette razor blades had, and the five blades actually seem to help avoid razor burn and cuts. Also the power button has been moved making accidental power on and offs a thing of the past. The razor honestly does a great job on the first shave, making going back over tough areas less likely, particularly right out of the shower.I know that most men have their favorite shaving products.

Like all other variants, you can swap the razor blade and handles, which is convenient. The Embrace blade head has a large design. It\'s still more narrow than say, the Hydro Silk, to you\'ll ultimately need to make more passes because of the narrow path. However, the larger head didn\'t seem to impede shaving very much. I did notice that it tended to bend the wrong way when I was shaving from certain angles, which causes it to drag over my skin. I expected some irritation from it, but nothing happened. It feels a little weird when that happens, but there\'s no lasting effects.I get as good a shave from this as my Venus Divine, which I have always liked. This one has added an extra blade, but I\'m not sure if the shave is that much closer. This design is supposed to be more moisturizing, however. This is due to a large moisturizing strip that surrounds the blades themselves. I noticed that it felt, well, slimier upon first use. The moisture quickly dried up, however. Whenever I step into the shower to use this after leaving it sit, it gets a little moist once again, but it doesn\'t last. In my opinion, I wouldn\'t count on using this without shaving cream for any area other than under your arms.With that said, I\'m not ready to switch over from my Venus Divine. This works well enough but it doesn\'t work any better for me to justify the price increase.    "

The best was yet to come though when no razor bumps appeared later.This product does come with a holder designed to be attached to theshower with suction cups, a nice touch.

I could not believe the difference between my regular disposable razor and this one in terms of how smooth the Embrace felt while shaving.  In fact, I couldn\'t tell if it was doing anything--which felt weird at first because, with my regular razor, I can clearly tell that it is.  Even stranger was that, while I couldn\'t FEEL that I was shaving with the Embrace, I had razor burn when I put on my deodorant after shaving, whereas I usually don\'t have any razor burn when using my regular razor.  It\'s very possible that I may have unconsciously pressed harder because I was used to feeling my other razor and that caused the burn, so this could be \'user error\' and not a product fault.  Once I am more accustomed to using it and have broken out of my old habits with my old razor, I will have a better idea of which it is.Design-wise, the gel-grip handle is great for good grip in the shower, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the \'pod\' that sticks on the shower wall and holds the razor and the extra blade cartridge.  However, once I took the razor out of the pod to shave, I couldn\'t quite figure out how to get it BACK into the pod.  There is only 1 way it fits and it took me a few tries to find it (it seems obvious, because you know it has to fit into the pod at the narrowest point of the handle but, even with that assumption, it still took a few tries).All in all, I was impressed with the Venus Embrace Razor.  I took off 1/2 star because, while I love concept of the pod, I thought it should be simpler to get the razor back into it without having to think about it, and I took off another 1/2 star because I got razor burn when I don\'t usually (but as noted, that may have been my fault).Edited several weeks (and numerous uses) later to add:1. Once I got used to using a lighter touch with this razor vs. my old one, the razor burn problem substantially lessened to the point where I am having little or no razor burn now.2.  Once I got it in my head that the razor always goes back in the pod with the blades facing IN (which make sense), I have found it much easier to get the razor back in the pod without fumbling around.

I\'ve used Venus products for several years, but this one is miles ahead of past versions, and it does everything it claims to do.Yes, it is comfortable to hold--rather like those pens with the soft rubbery stuff on the outside. I think it makes the razor less slippery in your hand as well. That\'s important in the shower especially. The holder is oddly shaped, but there are no hinges to open or to break. Time will tell if that open design is a good thing or not. It did fit well and unobtrusively in my cramped shower. I loved the suction cups though as opposed to the old sticky stuff.The most important thing, however, is the actual results from using the Venus Embrace. Here, it really shined. Smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I deliberately made only one pass to see how well the product worked. Perfect! One pass was all that was needed; my legs were smooth, hair-free, and without a single nick or scrape. There was a slight scrape on my underarm, but that could have been user error.

But I\'ve been ignoring the latest generation of razor blades because it seems the price has increased with each additional blade and innovation. While I don\'t want to have hairy legs or underarms, I\'m also economical and was skeptical over whether there would be enough difference in the results to justify the cost.  OK, so I\'m cheap - but life is expensive.The moving action of the blade reminded me of a Swiffer.  You don\'t have to put much pressure on the handle for the blade head to respond.  I initially thought the oversized blade might make it hard to stay with my leg, but it actually seemed to help. Despite the fact that the size of the razor blades themselves is probably about the same as the old Venus or another brand, it seemed like it took less time to shave my legs - maybe due to the fact the blade gripped my leg and I didn\'t have to keep going back to where I left off.I have to confess that the results of the Venus Embrace Razor may make it worth the increased cost - at least for those times when your legs or underarms are on display - like at the beach.  I felt as if I got a closer, smoother result with no nicks or scrapes than I have been getting from my 3 blade Venus razor, darn it all!  It\'s a great product, but I\'ll probably only buy for use during summer months; until I win the lottery, the $24.99 for 8 cartridges/blades is too expensive for everyday use no matter how much I like them.Update:  05/10/08 - I\'m afraid to say that having used the Embrace razor blades, I have now been ruined for the others.  I returned to my former blades and there was simply no comparison.  I thought maybe it was my imagination, but when I bought more Embrace razors, I found to my horror that they were every bit as good as I\'d remembered.  Save yourself if you want to avoid this expensive addiction and don\'t try them.  I have no doubt that if you do, you\'ll find them every bit as good as I have and won\'t want to shave with anything else.    "

What\'s different?  5 blades!I\'ve used most of the Venus products, thinking (erroneously) that I was leaving less plastic in a landfill by buying a razor with replaceable blades.  The first Venus promised \'the legs of a Goddess\'.  That one had 2 blades.  Somewhere along the line, they\'ve gone to 3, and now 5 blades.  There was even one that took a battery and vibrated a little bit!  But I digress.Out of the box:  a razor, an extra blade package, a suction cup mount for the shower wall.They were truthful, this razor will give you a close smooth shave.  The pivoting head keeps you from cutting yourself, and yes, this works well.  The \'moisture strip\' ensures a smooth glide up your leg.  Its quick, feels nice in your hand, and I got smooth, goddess-like legs without a lot of effort, and without having to stem any bleeding.  5 stars for shaving efficacy.I like the moisture strip because it allows the razor to glide smoothly up your leg without \'skipping\' or scraping.  It seems silly and maybe even gimmicky, but compared to a razor without one, the moisture strip is amazingly helpful.The little plastic gadget is meant to suction cup to the shower wall.  It opens like a little door to reveal a spare blade set.  Nice idea, but it wouldn\'t stick to my shower.  And when it falls off it blows itself to smithereens.  Earlier versions had double stick tape, and the suction cup idea is far preferable, if only it worked.Compared to disposable razors, this is far superior.  It works better, and you don\'t cut yourself.  Compared to other Venus razors, not much difference.  I like them all!  I\'m not convinced that 5 blades are necessary (unless you are a yeti) but all things being equal why not?All in all, highly recommended, watch for a sale.    "

There\'s a balance to it that makes shaving a pleasure and a hazard-free experience too! Yes, we\'ve come a long way, in how women\'s shavers are made. I still remember the one I used 40+ years ago. A clunky metal thing, with a knob that turned and opened the shaver so you could insert a double edged razor, and then you\'d proceed to mutilate yourself. Since then, we\'ve put a man on the moon, and with Venus, Gillette has made the perfect women\'s shaver!I also appreciate \'New Shower Pod,\' which has 2 suction cups that adhere to your shower tiles (or any flat surface) and not only cradles your shaver, but holds extra blade cartridges (2 cartridges come with the package) inside. It has a nifty \'space age\' design, just right for a Venusian. Gillette\'s Venus Embrace is the real deal, in a world full of hype. Try it, you\'ll like it.    "

Well Venuse Embrace were on sale so I decided to splurge and get it. The rubber handle is great and you can easily hold your grip on the razor. The moisturizing strips are awesome and really make it glide smoothly. You almost don\'t even need the soap (but I still do soap up). If I miss a spot, I can just go right over it without re-soaping leg. I have sensitive skin, so I was worried the five blades would irritate me but its been great, no irritation. Also these blades are lasting a long time. I\'m onto my 5th shave (both legs(thigh & calf) and underarms)and I\'m still getting a great super close shave.  These are definitely pricey, but as a splurge I\'d get them again and recommend to others. Also the little shower caddy does actually work. I was just going to throw the thing out but decided to try it. I figured I would toss it if it fell off. So far its been good and staying place. This is a nice bonus since I can keep the razor out of the reach of my 2 year old daughter. I did keep it on a ledge but it was always knocked down. This was a perk I didn\'t anticipate, so it made me feel a little better about the price LOL.    "

I got a smooth shave without nicks and I found the semi-solid handle to be ingenious.The five blades, on the other hand, seem a bit like overkill.  I shaved one leg with the five bladed Venus Embrace and another leg with my three bladed plain old Venus and I honestly did not notice a difference.  Both were smooth at the start without nicks, and both grew back at about the same rate.  I\'m of the opinion that the quality of your shave depends more on the quality of the blade than simply the number of blades.If you\'re looking to get this razor just for it\'s five blades, I can\'t say it\'s worth the cost.  As a razor, it\'s great, but it\'s not better than a three-blade as far as I\'m concerned.However, the semi-solid handle may be worth it.  It\'s comfortable to hold and use and moves with you to some extent.  It gets in the tight places better than other razors and helps to keep you from pressing too hard against your skin as you go.As for me, I\'m keeping my Venus Embrace handle and buying whatever cartridges are least expensive when I go shopping.  With four kids, I find the Venus Breeze cartridges to suit my short shower needs best.  Those and the Embrace handle are a great fit for me.    "

It had 5 blades, a surrounding cushion, a grippy handle, and it shaves beautifully.  I can\'t complain.  However, I\'ve been using a Venus for several years -- one with 3 blades -- and *it* shaves beautifully too.  The last time I shaved, I used both razors, one at a time of course, to see which performed better.  I really saw/felt no difference between the two.  The Embrace\'s 5 blades are smaller in width than the other razor\'s 3 blades.  The head of the Embrace is larger, supposedly to offer more cushioning.  But the difference between the two razors\' ability to shave really isn\'t noticable!  They both did a fine job!  So if you have an older-style Venus, you might as well keep using it.  No need to upgrade if you like the razor you already have.  And for those of you who haven\'t tried Venus razors, they allow you to give your legs safe, smooth shave.  I would recommend this product if you don\'t already have a razor you like.Edit: After several months of use, I can warn you... never leave this razor face-down on any surface (countertop, edge of bathtub, etc.)  The material surrounding the blade will stick to that surface and, when you try to pick up the razor, the material will rip like paper and leave a residue on the countertop or wherever (it can be removed, but it\'s sort of annoying.)

But this 5-razored Venus is shaking my complacency up. Something that I had taken for granted for so long, that the Mach3 was the be all-end all of razors, might no longer be true. When I used the Venus razor, it felt like it was wiping hair away. And I have a very thick beard. I have to go over an area twice, at least, after my Mach3 razor is on its first or second use.  The Venus created no problems at all, even after several uses. There was no irritation, no cuts, and nothing missed. Just total, smooth comfort.

Then I tried the Venus Embrace Razor.  I will never go back to my original razor choice again.First thing I noticed was how the Venus 5-blade razor with its ribbon of moisture \'zipped\' across my skin and removed all the hair smoothly, easily, quickly, and completely on the first stroke every time.  I had not even realized the \'drag\' I was experiencing with my original razor choice until I felt how smoothly the Venus razor did its work. I had just shaved my legs the previous day, but my razor had \'given out\' just before completing my shave and one leg had not gotten a smooth shave.  Trying Venus Embrace the next day, not only did I get an immediate and smooth shave on the \'unfinished\' leg, but on reshaving the \'completely shaved\' leg, I found that that I actually had not gotten a really thorough shave on it the day before either.I have always resisted those shaped, fat-handled razors because they look bulky.  My regular razor was thin and straight-handeled.  Now I see what all the hype is about.  The handle is comfortable, fits perfectly into the hand, is soft to the touch, and is wonderfully positioned.  It just feels \'good\' in my hand.  Actually it feels \'great\'.No \'suctioned-cupped\' item has ever seemed to work for me.  If they stuck at all, they were generally on the floor the next day.  Therefore I originally didn\'t intend to even try the showerpod.  After reconsidering how helpful it would be to have all my shaving utensils available inside the tub/shower area, I positioned it where I thought it would be handy if it would stick and affixed the suction cups.  Voila, it not only stuck, it is still there weeks later, never having come \'unstuck\' even once.While I regret my stubborness to give the newer-styled ladies razors a chance; I am completely sold on this Venus Embrance razor and anticipate it will be a long time before I think about changing razor brands again.

However, this razor really pulls at the underarms while shaving, and my underarms were quite senstive after shaving. Plus, this razor is pretty big (got to put 5 blades and a moisture ribbon somewhere), and that made it difficult to see while shaving my underarms.The storage pod for the shower? Clever idea, but try getting the thing open with wet hands. I\'ve found that it either pops open when I want it closed or won\'t open when I need it.Overall, this is a great razor for the legs. I like the smooth, close shave that it provides. However, after my underarm experience on 2 different occasions, I won\'t even attempt to use this for bikini areas (ouch). It\'s a bit too bulky for detail work, I think. That means I have to have 2 different razors, and that\'s a bit much.

I shaved my legs twice without replacing the head, and the second time was really not that satisfactory. In addition, the refills are PRICEY! They end up being over $2 apiece at the Amazon price or more than $3 apiece at the regular retail price.* The multiple blades trap longer hairs, so if it\'s been more than a couple of days since you\'ve last shaved your legs (so sue me -- it\'s not exactly shorts weather in Michigan right now!), you\'ll find yourself CONSTANTLY rinsing out the head.

These razor blades will last for months if you need them to. When I don\'t have the money to throw at these things I have used one razor for months. It\'s not the most comfortable shave you\'ll ever have but it\'s better than a four blade lol. These certainly are expensive but if you shave quickly, or tend to cut yourself it will be worth the expense.Tip: When you\'re done using it, don\'t place it blade down on anything. The gel strips will be used up much more quickly and will attach themselves to the surface they are placed onto (don\'t worry, not permanently).    "

I have very sensitive skin on my legs for some reason so it took a while to find the right blade. When the Embrace came out I fell in love. It gives me a great shave and smooth skin. The only downfall is that the blades tend to dull rather quickly. Sometimes it\'s only 4-6 uses before they\'re dull but sometimes they last a bit longer. The moisturizer strips last a long time. They tend to outlive the blades, actually.All in all I love these, but they dull fast so cost a whole lot more in the long run. But if you have sensitive skin like me, it\'s worth it!    "

And they last forever without getting dull!  As far as the shower pod goes, it hangs on my shower wall without a problem unless I bang into it.  I don\'t really use it to hold extra cartridges though, for two reasons:  1.  if you change the blade in the shower, what do you do with the trash? 2.  it only holds two cartridges and you can\'t buy just two cartridges so there\'s always some stored somewhere else anyway.

I can run the razor over my skin fast, with very light pressure, and it still shaves perfectly. For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area. With every other razor (even the Breeze, which was my prior favorite) I had to slow way down and go carefully or I\'d nick myself in those spots. So I can shave faster! I shave in the shower, and I don\'t find shave gel or foam to be necessary.My problems with razor burn and bumps in the underarm and bikini area are over. Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions. With previous razors I had to shave those spots repeatedly in different directions, using a lot of pressure, to get a close shave. That lead to painful razor burn, and so most of the time I just tolerated a rough shave there. No more! I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure. Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.There are two things I don\'t like about the Embrace cartridges:Cost: They\'re expensive! But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher cost.The size: They\'re big. The only reason this is a problem for me is the shower pod: Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they *don\'t* fit in the Breeze shower pod.  I ended up buying an Embrace starter pack with a handle and shower pod so I could store the cartridges in the shower pod.  I didn\'t realize until I opened the starter pack that the Embrace shower pod only holds *two* cartridges. So when you open a 4-pack of cartridges, you\'ll have to keep the extra cartridges somewhere else. One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else. It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \'cute\' over making it useful for storage. At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall so it doesn\'t get knocked onto the shower floor and stepped on.(Another reviewer reported that the shower pod keeps detaching from the wall. I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn\'t get bumped and rarely gets splashed. It\'s remained firmly attached for months. I also have a fiberglass shower. I don\'t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy tile.)Summary: The Embrace cartridge gives a truly superior shave. It\'s worth every cent.EDIT: April 11, 2011: Wouldn\'t you know it, shortly after I wrote this glowing review I got a bad batch. The bad cartridges didn\'t shave as smoothly and I had some mild razor burn with them. They also seemed to dull more quickly. Since the bad batch I had tried another box and they worked well again. I am not changing my five-star rating yet, but I will be paying attention to whether the bad box was a fluke, or a warning of quality control problems.    "

Once you apply, if you put a shirt on right after, chances are it\'s going to get on the shirt.The first day I somehow got it on my hands after putting my shirt on and went to eat breakfast. Didn\'t taste very good.Secondly, when showering the next day it leaves an odd waxy residue that literally has to be rubbed off (it catches your finger).But I suppose that\'s why it\'s such a powerful antiperspirant and deodorant.Both are fairly non-issues, but are important to consider if looking at all of your options.If you can live with it being a bit messy, it\'s definitely a very powerful deodorant and antiperspirant.At the current discounted price it\'s around 4 bucks each in the pack of 6, which is a bit expensive-- but it\'ll definitely keep you fresh all day.

First thing he noticed was that he had to turn the wheel (pushing the product upward) many many times to get it to reach the surface where it could be used.  Therefore, it is obvious that the container is not completely full, and therefore the user is actually getting less product than the size of the container would imply.  The directions say \'three clicks.\'  Yeah, right.  That may be true after the first use, but certainly not true for the initial use.  Also, the name of the anti-perspirant includes the words \'advanced solid,\' but the stuff that exuded from the little holes in the top sure looks like a thick cream.Other than that, all he could say about the product is that it seems to be a perfectly adequate anti-perspirant.  Even though he is a very active guy, he was neither negatively nor positively impressed.  Maybe he had a rather neutral reaction to it because he is just not the type of guy who stays awake at night wondering if he has damp spots on his shirt in the summertime that might gross-out his coworkers.In any case, he felt that the product does the job, but he wondered if it was worth the price differential over other brands.

I am the kind of person that finds a product that works and uses it for a long time.  I have been using Mitchum deodorant for over 10 years.  Because of my allergies to perfumes and fragrance, I could not use the other Gillette Clinical Strength products. However, when I found this one, it passed the sniff test.  Although it has a scent, it is best described as a \'masking scent.\' This means that while the product is on me, I do not smell it. I can smell it when I put it on, but it does not make me sneeze.  That means, throughout the entire day, I have the protections of the product without the fragrance.The deodorant instructions state to put it on at night, since that is when it works best.  I follow those instructions, but I also put on a small amount after my showers.  It is hot in Southern California, and I have to walk a far distance to teach my classes on campus. I sweat, and what professor wants to stink in front of their class?  Compared to the Mitchum (and a few others I experimented with) this product is the best deodorant I have ever used.  I do not smell myself in front of the class room while teaching.  I have worked outside all day, sweating in hot weather, and when I come inside the house, my underarms smell like I just put the deodorant on.I highly recommend this product.  I have allergies, so I am limited to certain kinds of hygiene products.

I don\'t even stink of sweat, I just sweat out of my underarms alot.  Once a coworker even commented on it at my shirt and tie client facing job, recommending I change the brand of antiperspirant I use--but it wasn\'t like I didn\'t know I had this problem so it wasn\'t any more embarassing than the problem itself, now solved by great products like this one.  This not only helps me personally, but professionally as well.So I\'ve been using Degree prescription strength antiperspirant for about a year and a half now, and when the opportunity came up to try out a sample of this Gillette version I merely thought it would save me ten dollars.  Instead, I will be buying this from now on.What\'s the difference?  The active ingredient is the same and in the same amount--so one is just as effective as the other--and they both have moisturizers and such so that they don\'t irritate my underarms.  But the applicators are different in design and I have to say Gillette wins on this aspect alone.DESIGN / APPLICATOR: On the Degree product, the place on the applicator where the cream comes out is about the size of a quarter, whereas on the Gillette version it\'s wide enough to cover my entire underarm so I don\'t have to do circles with it to make sure I applied completely.  I believe this also causes me to use less of it, which makes it last longer and therefore is a better value.COMFORT: I noticed that with the Gillette product they seem to have put something in it that gives me a nice cooling sensation when I apply it.  It\'s very subtle, and very nice.  Degree, nor any other antiperspirant I\'ve ever tried, doesn\'t seem to have this.  I also feel the Gillette product is more comfortable.EFFECTIVENESS: As I wrote above, literally no difference in effectiveness between the Degree and Gillette products.  Same active ingredient, in the same amount.SCENT: The Gillette product that I sampled--the one on this page--has so little scent to it that we could say it practically has none.  It smells like and about as strong as Aveno moisturizer.  The Dove product, for comparison, smells really good, but not so strong that people notice it when you\'re near them.  I like the Gillette scent, or lack thereof, better.BOTTOM LINE: I didn\'t think this sample would cause me to change clinical strength antiperspirant from the brand I\'ve been using for years, but it did.  You should definitely try both and decide for yourself which one you prefer, but for me the clear winner is Gillette.    "

The razors were ordinary razors, from Gillette. Those razors don\'t come into this tale. But attached to the outside of the pack of ordinary razors was one special razor, a sample of another razor model. This is its story.At first, the special razor lay in the bathroom drawer, watching as ordinary razors were used and thrown away, used and thrown away. It was a lonely existence as the only one of its kind. No bright colors or fancy features made this razor stand out from the crowd. Razors came and razors went as the tough-bearded man shaved his sensitive face.Then one day it was the special razor\'s turn.The first shave was fine, a nice close shave that didn\'t sting that sensitive face. It might even have ended that day, if the rough-bearded man had thrown the special razor in the trash. But he didn\'t, for he was frugal too.The second shave was fine as well.And the third. Unusual, thought the rough-bearded man.But the fourth time he shaved his sensitive face with the special razor is when he began to suspect that this razor was special, indeed. What razor stays sharp for four shaves? And a disposable too! The man felt his smooth skin and wondered if it could be. He set the razor aside just in case, on the slimmest hopes there could be another smooth shave. How wonderful, how magical that would be!The next day came, as they always do. And the rough-bearded man lifted the special razor to his sensitive face. And shaved.No pulling! No stinging! A smooth and silky shave! It was all true. Then the rough-bearded man knew that this was not merely a special razor. Nay, this was indeed -- a Magic Razor!He asked the razor its name. The razor said, \'Gillette Custom Plus 3 Sensitive\'.The rough-bearded man with the sensitive face smiled a wide smile with his smooth skin. Some say the razor smiled too.The End    "

I have tried, bought, or sampled just about everything out there except a straight razor.  I even have a very expensive safety razor \'kit\' I purchased from an internet supplier of shaving supplies.  The most expensive razor felt like I was using a Samurai sword on my face and it simply did not work as well as these Gillette Custom Plus pivoting razors did.  Again, maybe they just work well for \'my face\', i\'m not sure, but these work well for me.  Very comfortable, reasonably priced (about $1.30 a razor), and the longest use I get from a razor before I have to throw them away.  I would dare say (from my experience) that these razors use the exact same \'head\' or \'cartridge\' on them as the Gillette \'Sensor 3\' Razors which also work very well for me.  I always seem to come back to either the Custom Plus or Sensor 3 (both by Gillette) and again I think they use the exact same cartridge on top (triple blade) but they have a different shaped handle.  Thats the only difference between them.  I usually get about 7 to 10 days of shaving with these.  Other disposables give me 3 to 5 days before becoming very dull and unusable for my face.  Make sure you flush the blades out with water and let the razor dry after use for the best result and longest days of use.  Another trick with these (or any razor for that matter) is a high quality shave cream.  I\'m not talking about these \'foams\' or crap like that.  You know what i\'m talking about.  Get yourself a good quality shave cream in a jar and a badger hair brush to apply it with.  I know, some people may think i\'m crazy or something, but trust me on this one.  The badger hair brush (GOOD QUALITY ONE!) may cost you about $35 or up.... in price.  It will last a LONG TIME (years) if you take care of it and shake it out and dry it each day.  A good quality shave cream (such as something from Crabtree & Evelyn or Sephora, or ULTA will set you back between $20 to $30 a jar, tube, or tub but you use very little each day by applying it with the Badger hair brush you purchase and it will last forever trust me.  When I say it will provide you with a super close shave, I mean closer than using a cheap foam or gel.  I was about 40 years old when I finally broke down and bought a good quality Badger brush (after seeing reviews about them on-line) and I was so happy I did it I will never go back to those junk foams or gels that cost $2 at Walmart or similar locations.  You wouldn\'t think it would make that much of a difference, but trust me, IT DOES!!!!!  It just simply makes a difference, period.  Coupled with the Gillette Custom Plus razors and a good quality shave cream and Badger Hair brush, you\'ll have a great shave that is very close, even if you have a coarse beard like mine.  Happy shaving my friends!    "

It\'s all just marketing.  These blades do the job, and they don\'t tear up your skin as badly.  Plus, buying these blades on Amazon makes buying slightly more affordable.

During the first use, I noticed two things: One, there is a lot of slobbery goop coming off the razor... and two, the shave gel bars that sit above and below the blades make it very difficult to get a close shave. They do flex a little, but especially when they are new, they are cumbersome and they block the blades from getting close enough to the skin, especially in contoured areas like the knee and the bikini area. It does moisturize well, though, and at least for the first use or two, you won\'t need to use any shaving cream. I didn\'t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn\'t able to shave.By the third use, those gel bars have worn down a little (or a lot) and you can get a closer shave. But now with less slobbery gel goop, you are very likely to have irritated skin or little cuts. I have to use soap to lubricate my skin before shaving if the cartridge is not brand new, and I keep cutting my armpit with this razor and I didn\'t seem to have that problem with the regular Venus razor.The gel is either gone or falls off by about the fifth or sixth use. These cartridges are just way too expensive to have to replace them so often. I found that leaving the razor in the shower cuts it\'s life even shorter so I keep it in a cupboard when I\'m not using it... so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn\'t serve much purpose. Maybe if you are the only one who uses your shower and you shave every time you\'re in there you can get some use out of it.I like using this on my legs during the summer when I shave every day and I don\'t want to spend the extra time with shaving cream. I don\'t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble. I wouldn\'t buy this again- the regular Venus is easier to maneuver and shaves closer. Even if I have to buy shaving cream again.    "

It prevents razor burn as well as pulling and tugging.  With this design, it is not necessary to use shaving cream or soap for a lubricant.The downside of these razors is that there is no guard so when they get wet, the lotion bars fall off before they are all used up.  The refills are also a bit pricey.Nevertheless, this is a very nice shaving tool that is well worth a try.    "

The package, which appeared as if it might be difficult to open, was quite easy to open and the razors themselves are very easy to change. The spa breeze smell is very nice. It is soft and not too overwhelming.I feared that this product might not deliver a close shave, but indeed I was wrong. What I like best about these razors is no shaving cream or additional lather is required. Just wet the blade and shave away. It couldn\'t be easier. I *hate* to shave and this definitely makes the whole experience a lot more pleasant and easy. The blades are a bit more expensive then the cheap, pink daisy razors that I have always used, but they last for a long time.I have been changing the blade about once every 10 days and I typically shave every other day. I highly recommend this product. I will NOT be switching back to my daisy razors and generic shaving cream. In fact I just bought my first package of refill razors.    "
1551,1603,20090528,B001JQLNFA,2,"May 28, 2009",A20I9N5D71O8UT,Okay - not so bad,"For a woman who wants a quick shave, this seems like a solution.  But I discovered I could get just as quick a shave with some body lotion, and a regular razor.  In either case, the razor cannot be gripped too firmly because your leg IS going to hurt with a dry shave.  The lotion comes out of this razor on the second leg, and never in any quantity to be any help.For a quick shave, try some body lotion and a regular razor, but only if you have a little hair, and remember to lightly press.UPDATE:  It seems to work fine as long as you keep the razor totally satured with warm water and make sure you use a light touch.  I also put lotion on my leg before shaving because of the bad stinging that happened once after shaving.Works for a quick shave if you\'re not looking for perfection.    "

I have to admit the Venus Breeze has some real positives to it. The styling is pretty, pink (real girly-girl factor) and fits well in your hand (ergonomically). The packaging is well done and the way the razor blades are packaged within their own little cups, is a real cute design.I find the overly large spa strips (with lotion) to be both a positive and a negative factor when dealing with the Venus. First, when using on your legs, I have to admit it\'s really great. I found the shave to be close and my legs were amazingly smooth after using it (almost as if I had used some kind of baby lotion or shaving cream on my legs). However, when I tried to use it on my underarms and bikini area, I found the stips as well as the pivoting factor of the razor design, to make it awkward and almost impossible to get a good shave. If you are looking for a razor to use primarily on your legs, then this one is it. However, if you are looking for an all around razor, this may not work for you.    "

The Green Tea scent is very \'spa-like\' and feminine.  The blade contours all the nooks and crannies of my body wonderfully and there wasn\'t one nick at all.  Over the years I have been a loyal follower of the \'Intuition\' razor and \'Veet\' line.  I don\'t like buying shaving cream seperately and find that the cream clogs the razor from doing its job after all.  The downfall of the \'Intuition\' was that the head was rather clunky at about an inch height and the soap part would wear down rather quickly.The Venus has a soft pink head that is actually very gel-like in feeling.  I used it to shave my legs, under arms and bikini area and haven\'t seen any wear on the jelly heads that surround the blades.  The actual handle feels great in my hand; especially the little spot on the head where I place my finger to control the pressure that I apply whilst shaving.  Very thoughtful product that was truly tested.  My one only complaint at the time is that shaved hair gets caught underneath the jelly sides.  I have to manually go and remove all the hair each time.... which is rather annoying.You get two head cartridges with that delightful scent and case that will hold the cartridges and handle.  You can even hang it with the \'stickies\' supplied.  I haven\'t tried the \'stickies\' because from past experience they either fall or they stick to the tile forever while the product is on the floor.  I wish companies would jump on the suction cup back like the \'Intuition\' provides.Highly recommend the product because I did not have one nick or any bumps after shaving.  Very smooth, close shave for a sensitive skin user here!    "
1581,1633,20090429,B001JQLNFA,3,"April 29, 2009",A1JOANG98KBFKU,It\'s okay. The Venus Embrace is better.,"Yes, it gives a smooth shave, but with a good bit of extra effort.  It does NOT navigate curvy legs very well. I had more than one significant cut the first time I used it.  I felt like the head pivoted a little TOO much which made it hard to keep the blades in contact with my skin.  The gels strips do not lather, but do have a very strong, but not unpleasant fragrance.  However, if you are sensitive to perfume, this is not your razor.Because the head is so bulky, the shave actually took longer than with a straight razor. The bulbous looking things on either side of the blade created drag on curved areas, such as underarms and ankles and didn\'t glide over those areas successfully.  I had to go over them several times to remove all unwanted hair.I would say this is BETTER than the Soliel razor that I bought for less money (smoother shave) but not as good as the Venus Embrace which gave me a smoother shave with a little less effort and no heavy perfume.My overall complaint with ALL of the Gillette Venus line is that the razors are very bulky. They do provide a good shave, but you have to cover the same areas more than once because the shave head is so large.  For my sensitive skin, that means more razor irritation.  I would recommend this one over several other out there, but if you want the best shave for the same price, go with the Embrace.    "

The blade is sharp and doesn\'t leave nicks!  The lotion leaves your skin feeling nice and smooth.The only thing I have to say negative is the cream strip doesn\'t last as long as the blade!

1591,1643,20090423,B001JQLNFA,5,"April 23, 2009",A4UFU4WKYEUGO,A Lady\'s Razor,"Nicely packaged. The blades are in little plastic capsules that sit inside a plastic housing with a lid. This is a big switch from most ladies razors I have tried. Because the blades are sealed, they don\'t loose their moisturizing gel every time you turn on the shower. The casing comes with a little mounting bracket that is not hard to place or figure out. I have really bad eyesight, so fishing around for a razor without my glasses on can be entertaining.The razor and stem are ridiculously feminine. It really does go right past any attempt at simple functionality and well into something a 14 year old girl would throw a tantrum for. It\'s marvelous. The stem is a very elegant swirly pearl color with all these interesting rubber bits that make it easy to hold. It is easy to hold. I think you\'d really have to make an effort to drop it regardless of how soaped up you get. But you won\'t drop it because you will not want to.The blades are surrounded by these wide pink lip like things that look, to be quite honest, like something you\'d find in a adult movie used by the goddess of immaculate hairlessness. They are squishy and smell wonderful. They also work quite well if you get them damp so you can have a safe dry shave, or touch up.The Venus Breeze razor is really over the top but does function quite well. I tried it out on three day old leg stubble and was left with baby soft skin. I like it. It\'s a private, sweet smelling indulgence that works.    "

However, it may not be for all skin types.  The gel bars built into the cartridge should give most women an ultra convenient all-in-one shaving experience, but my skin ended up with very mild razor burn.  I started out as the package suggested, in the shower and wetting the razor, then when that burned as I stroked, I made sure that my legs were wet too.  Even that wasn\'t enough; hours later I can feel where each swathe of the razor went. I can also feel how nice and smooth my legs are. It gives a close shave. It\'s a lovely razor; I just need more lubricant.Four stars - it should work well for most users.  But beware if you have dry skin or like me have that thin, no-tan skin; you may need to add a little shaving cream.    "

Usually the other reviews merely validate my own opinion.  Rarely do I find myself disagreeing with the reviews significantly.  Although I am rating the item 4 stars like most I do find the reasons for complaint or praise are different from myself and my fellow reviewers.Pros:1.  Light smell.  Many seem to complain about the strong smell.  I find it not too strong.  Maybe this is my nose not working but I find it pleasant.2.  Shirt friendly.  I have seen a few reviewers complain about the shirt staining.  I recommend you change detergent.  I have never had a problem with staining of shirts or even residue during the day.3.  Glides well for a non-gel stick.  I like the application of gels but this does a nice job and does not pull hair.Cons:1.  The mix is so water repellent that washing it off in the shower is a bit of a pain.  A minor issue but one I am reminded of each morning.A very good stick that is easy in application and seems effective in odor and moisture control.  Nicely done.

In my mind, I couldn\'t imagine a more comfortable shave than what I was already getting with my Mach3.  Yesterday, I was at the store to buy a new Mach3 because my old handle had worn down over the years, and I finally decided to give one of Gilette\'s newer razors a try.I ended up getting a manual Fusion Proglide, and I was absolutely thrilled during my first shave with it this morning.  It was by far the best shave I have ever experienced!  The Proglide is so smooth, it hardly felt like there were any blades on the thing as I ran it over my skin.  It felt so nice, I am looking forward to using it again tomorrow morning (instead of waiting my usual two days).Unfortunately, although the razor package that comes with the handle is not much more expensive than some of the older Gilette razors, the replacement blades are noticeably more expensive.  I generally use my blades longer than most, but if you tend to run through new blades pretty quickly, using the Proglide may end up getting costly.  Regardless, I am now hooked on this thing already and will be sticking to this product.  For me, it\'s definitely worth the increased price, because I can\'t imagine having a better shave than what I experienced this morning!    "

I preordered this razor with the hopes it would be better than the original fusion. I am happy to say from my experience that it is to me. This razor has no pull on a three day old beard along with no nicks or cuts, this must be due to the thinner finer blades. This is why they call it the pro glide. The lubrication strip is a lot bigger than the original and the diffrence is slightly noticeable during the shave. There was no stubble left over with a second pass. I have never tried the fusion power due to I feel that it is sort of a gimmic with the vibration in ways that other power razors have cut me or tugged at the beard so I stick with the manual. So far i am very pleased with this razor and even ordered the blade refills already. I will never even look back at my old fusion now due to the upgraded comfort and longer lasting blades of proglide. One reviewer feels that this razor is not much of an upgrade from the original and to stick with the original fusion but I beg to differ strongly. The old fusion is nice but no where compares to the proglide. It is definately worth the almost $11 for the best shave I have found so far!    "

I still feel the additional blades (over 3) does not contribute to the closer shave. It is a result of the tension strip that stretches your skin as you shave.

But is it sigificantly better than the original fusion? This is what I\'ve found. I shave in the shower, warm water, using a unscented Gillette shaving gel. The handle of the proglide has a slightly different shape, more of a knob at the end. I suppose the knobv makes it easier to grasp the end of the razor when making gentle swipes alog the skin, sort of an artist at work. But the handle of the original fusion is also okay, and I don\'t think the new handle is much of an improvement, if any. The blades in  the cartridge are great, more than marginally better than the original. A few easy swipes do the job for most of the face. I\'ve found the razor shaves closer than the original about the neck and above the upper lip. Result is the shave time is quicker with a good result. I also believe a proglide cartridge will last longer than the fusion. I\'ve used one cartridge for about twenty shaves, and so far it is doing the job. thus, since the cartridge seems to give more shaves, that fact ought to offset the extra cost. Bottom line is, the new proglide fusion is great, better than the original, but since the original fusion cartridges also do a great jobb, I plan to use them up before switching over to the proglide.Update april 2011 - I think the proglide works best for men who shave every day, and against the grain for a close shave. The blades are thin and close and work best with short hairs. When shaving with two or more days of growth, hthen it\'s best to first shave downward, with the grain, and then up against the grain to get a close shave.    "

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.    "

That will soften the hair and open the pores.I also recommend Kiehl\'s brand \'Blue Eagle\' or \'White Eagle\' shaving cream. It\'s about $20 a jar but it\'s by far the best shaving cream I\'ve used.

Wow!  This thing actually shaved me well, didn\'t but me up and even had a nice trimming blade on back.  I thought that a four blade razor would be too wide/long to shave well, but I was wrong.  The best part about the Fusion is that the blades last a LONG time.  I mean it\'s nothing for me to get two or three months out of a single blade.  Amazing.The only downside is that they are expensive, but considering how well they shave and how long they last, I still come out ahead.

I also like the straight edge but for someone who would do precision shaping on a goatee this is not the best choice. I personally like the gilette product that i provided a link to. and being half price doest hurt either.    "
1975,2047,20100810,B003987CL0,5,"August 10, 2010",A99BPI4IGPB2Y,Best Gillette ever -- and it\'s actually CHEAPER!!,"I won\'t repeat what some of the other reviewers have said about how well the new Power Proglide shaves, but suffice it to say, it\'s the most comfortable shave I\'ve ever experienced (and I have a very sensitive neck). It\'s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.  To the couple of reviewers that say they couldn\'t tell the difference, I\'d say you\'re either shaving wrong or do not have sensitive skin.  With the Fusion Power, I\'d pretty much have to shave in the shower to avoid razor burn on my neck.  With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving -- no razor burn at all (or ingrown hairs), even shaving against the grain on my neck.Here\'s what a lot of the reviewers are missing. On the Fusion Power, I had to change blades every 7-10 days. Any more than that and I\'d get torn up. I\'m in my TENTH week of using the Power Proglide blades, and I\'m on my THIRD BLADE!!! It\'s JUST about time to change, but I could still probably handle another shave or two with no less comfort than I had with the regular Fusion Power blades. 3 BLADES in 67 days!!  And the other cool thing is that these blades work perfectly on the Fusion Power chassis, so no need to buy the new Power Proglide razor (unless you just want to upgrade for the looks).So yes, individually, the blades ARE more expensive than any other blade. But the cost savings, even over just a year, will be SIGNIFICANT for me -- almost $60/year vs. the Fusion Power... AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHAVE EVER??? It\'s a no brainer!!Update:  Still LOVING this shaver almost a year later.  I did determine that what you\'re using for shaving cream makes a BIG difference.  I\'ve used Neutrogena for Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream for years, but decided to try an organic one from Kiss Your Face.  Lots of razor burn and discomfort with that cream, even with a brand new blade (tried it for two days).  So, back to the Neutrogena and couldn\'t be happeier with the Fusion Power ProGlide.    "

It\'s all sizzle and not too much substance.  Don\'t get me wrong you\'ll get a good shave, relatively speaking.  But I\'ve had better shaves with other less costly razors. I\'ve used the Fusion, both manual and power, and the Mach 3.  After shaving for a number of years with both Fusion power and manual, I\'ve detected no difference between a \'power\' shave and a manual one. The Proglide is no different.  The \'power\' option with battery and all sounds great, but doesn\'t work at all.  It\'s a placebo and an expensive one at that.I\'m going back to using Mach3.Here\'s a tip that has really served me well:  use hair conditioner rather than shaving foam, and you will get a much closer shave.  At first, I didn\'t believe a friend of mine when he gave me this tip.  But it\'s true.  I get much closer shaves.  And the other great benefit is that your razor blades last much, much longer.  Instead of a razor blade lasting me for a couple of weeks, tops, when I use foam, my blade is good for six to eight weeks when I use hair conditioner. Needlessly to say, now I only use hair conditioner for shaves.  And I don\'t have to tell you, this translates to not only getting great shaves, but to saving a lot of money!    "

Probably spent thousands of dollars on these contraptions, and for what??--as I\'ve learned, the shave you get from the cartridge razors is simply not as good as old-fashioned straight razor and safety razor shaves. If you don\'t take yourself seriously as a man and as a connoisseur, than by all means, stick with cartridge razors and waste money to boot. But if you value the lofty experience, the pinnacle of manly class and style, try out traditional shaving.I switched to a safety razor rather than move up to the Proglide. I\'m glad I did.The best shave you can get, of course, is from a professional barber with a profesionally-maintained straight razor. But that\'s an occasional treat, unless you have the time to go to your barbershop every morning and afternoon for shaves (I hope that tradition makes a comeback, though). Maintaining a straight razor at home is time-consuming. And you have to treat shaving with more care and caution, lest you bloody your shower as in a scary horror flick. The good medium compromise is the famous safety razor, which is making a comeback these days. You buy a safety razor handle, made of heavy metal, usually stainless steel. It feels good, heavy, solid in your hand. You buy an inexpensive supply of safety razor blades. Easy to replace, they last about 1-2 weeks per double-sided blade, dependng on beard thickness. Standard safety blades will do you fine, and they\'re much, much less expensive than constantly buying cartridges which clog and wear out quickly (if you want the best safety razor blades, [...] ([...]) has cryo-treated safety blades that last five times as long as regular safety blades, so you save even more money).Then, you buy several shaving soaps and soap dishes, for variety if you like, which are better for your skin than mass-market aerosol shaving gels. The mass-market stuff is junk. Traditional shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful. The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave. I keep five different soaps in my shower in separate bowls so i can switch depending on my mood for scents. You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man\'s lifestyle.Simply put, safety razors and straight razors give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price. And btw, a quality aftershave treatment will also be very good for your skin, it does make a difference. Due to the greater time-consumption of maintaining a straight razor, I suggest trying a safety razor outfit first.    "

So, it goes without saying when I figured I had enough of my face and chin looking like a rocky road I was bound to notice improvements when I picked up this razor, and I did.Quality isn\'t an issue here: the razor looks great, and gives me a very smooth shave. There is also a vibrating function which I choose to use since it eliminates just about any tug I feel on my skin. My shave feels much more comfortable, looks better, and even with 5 blades it works well against my sensitive skin which I already see improving. The precision trimmer edges up nicely for the clean cut look, but after experimenting I also feel it\'s a less risky shave than the main blades around the \'danger zone\' chin and neck area.So now, I got my free razor from Gillette, love it and plan on getting more razors/blades...whats the catch? At almost four bucks a blade for refills, this is simply outrageous and it\'s a dealbreaker for me.

Razor handle has a nicer and more expensive \'feel\' to it. It has a little heft, so to speak.CONCERNS / ISSUES:1. The razors are materially more expensive than the Mach 3. It\'s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money. If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I\'d go with this one.2. The razors are thinner. I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.3. Amazon has great info and instructions. The razor itself does not. It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box. For example, I really wasn\'t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head. I might have appreciated some of the features more if I had understood what they were for and that is not always obvious from the packaging.    "

I now use a simple old fashion safety razor which works great and the blades are dirty cheap.  Now I won\'t disagree that the Fusion cuts fine and I can shave in record time without fear of removing my Adam\'s apple but $4 a blade is just robbery.  For the most part I think I\'ll stick to safety razor for the bulk of my shaving and then finish up the \'scary\' areas with the Fusion.  This prolongs the life of the Fusion.  The safety razor actually works better if you let your whiskers grow longer as since it\'s single blade it never clogs.If you currently use the old Fusion then I fail to see any benefit in this new model.  I\'m sure they have some lovely marketing but in the end it\'s 98% the same and I couldn\'t tell the difference.  Perhaps the biggest fluff is the \'power\' feature.  It\'s completely useless and IMO is just an attempt to add another disposable item to this razor.  I\'m not sure who asked for their razor to shake in their hands but that\'s not what I want while I\'m shaving around my lips or throat.  I wound up keeping it off while I shave.  I\'m also still not a fan of the flip back behavior of the Fusion... I prefer the head to stay still but since this isn\'t new then maybe you\'re fine with it.Overall it\'s a fine razor, but it\'s a marketing (not engineering) upgrade with goals to charge you just a bit more per blade but it\'s already too much IMO.

My brother tried it and had the same problem in his words the razor sucks.

I have all the products - the Merkur\'s safety razors, the Gillette Fatboy, and as assortment of straight razors from Dovo and Thiers Issard.  There is nothing more that I enjoy than lathering up my Rooney silvertip badger and shaving on a weekend morning.  However, for those quick morning shaves before work I always turn to my trusty Gillette, ranging over my shaving career from the Sensor Excel to the Mach III to the Fusion and now the Proglide.  I have to say, each has been an improvement over the previous, with the newest generation being the best.Gillette loves to throw in the marketing gimmicks - the \'enlarged lubrastrip\', the \'redesigned precision trimmer\', the \'micro-combs\', and the \'thinner, finer blades.\'  All of these are just lovely ways of saying - hey, we are not giving you a different colored fusion razor like the phenom or racecar or matrix of whatever they called the other Fusions.What I can say, is that somehow with all these \'innovations\', they have managed to minorly improve an already stellar razor.  It does what it says, it glides better on your face.  It have me a 9/10 shave with one pass with the grain in 1 minute of time with no irritation.  You maybe able to get a 10/10 baby butt smooth shave with a Thiers Issard straight blade with a careful four pass 15 minute shaving, but who has time for that!  And it has less tug, less drag than the fusion.Gillette has always been the King of shaving.  The Fusion has put all other over the counter modern safety razors to shame.  This just follows their precedent.  Yeah, it is a Fusion razor with a blue LED light and some minor changes.  But hey!  It\'s great.  It is an all around great razor.  The Proglide will now be my new go to razor for the prework shave.  I give it four stars because it is a great razor, it\'s the best on the market, but it isn\'t perfection.  Gillette is striving towards it.  I want that 10/10 shave.  That may be too much to ask.  But is Gillette thinks they\'ve gotten it complete figured out, they\'ll stop trying.Good job, Gillette.

The blade separation looks different and the hair trimmer is certainly easier to cleaner than previous incarnations of the five blade format. But the shaving process felt no different and the results were certainly no different to my present Fusion electric razor. So I put a new blade in the Fusion and did - to the extent possible - a subjective side by side comparison of the Proglide and the Fusion. They seemed the same to me.We all know that the Gillette - now P & G - consumer model is on the blade replacement rather than the razor - but this version of the 5-blade seems to lack sufficient advancement in the technology to provide a better shave, The New Yorker columnist,  Adam Gopnik, actually wrote a nice piece on the razor wars that can be found as \'Reflections, \'The Fifth Blade,\' The New Yorker, May 11, 2009, p. 50 [...]The Proglide would fit right in with Mr. Gopnik\'s conclusions    "

As such, my review will not apply to men who want to know how it glides on the angles of their face, or how it trims the hair near their nose, etc.  Sorry.If you\'re a woman reading this - here\'s what you need to know:First of all, I\'m a teensy bit OCD when it comes to shaving my legs; I shave them every day and sometimes twice a day.  I know - it\'s stupid - I can\'t help it.  Anyway, I thought a power razor would be an easy way to do a quick shave when I\'m doing a 2nd shave of the day... so I wouldn\'t have to get in the shower a 2nd time.  I imagined that the reason for a power razor was that you could use it dry.  No.You still need wet skin to use this razor, and really - wet skin with some sort of lubricant (body wash, etc) is best.  I don\'t really understand why you need a vibrating \'power razor\' when you still have to have wet skin and shaving cream (or similar) to use it.  What is the advantage of the power?  Why not use a regular razor if you\'re doing all that anyway?  There\'s probably some reason that I don\'t get, and I\'m certainly not going to take away stars for my own ignorance, but I\'m just telling you in case you thought you could use this razor dry.As a razor in the shower, it shaves well.  The shave is close and smooth, with no nicks.  Personally I prefer the Schick Intuition since you can skip using the body wash with that (as it has it\'s own lubricating bar).  But this one shaves very well, and an advantage over the Intuition is that it has a \'floating\' head that goes over bumps like knees more easily and smoothly than a stationary blade like the Intuition.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the replacement heads are pretty pricey, and seem to get dull fairly quickly.BOTTOM LINE:  As long as you know what you\'re getting, it\'s a good comfortable razor that\'s easy to hold and shaves well.

2052,2127,20100524,B003987CL0,3,"May 24, 2010",A2KHG3JOFXQ4CE,Great Shave But It WILL Cost You,"I had used the predecessor of this model for a few years right up until I retired 18 months ago. When working, even though I made enough money then to buy the EXPENSIVE replacement cartridges, it always left me complaining about the price of such a wonderful shaving experience. Now that I am retired, I had switched to the old fashioned safety razor and began buying assortment packs of different manufactures blades till I found what works best for ME. Turned out, the very cheapest of the dozen brands, works best for me so I have been much happier shaving the old fashioned CHEAP way.  Enter this new version of my old friend....I had to try it since the one biggest downside for me with a so called safety razor is cutting myself. Since a recent heart attack and the blood thinner medication I now have to take, cuts are becoming a real problem. And this razor is SO much safer as well as more comfortable, I had to try it when offered on the Vine Program. Feels the same, looks a little better (to me anyway) than my old unit. Now, this \'soothing micro-pulses for incredible comfort\'? OK, if you say so....Myself, it is simply a major distraction! I can\'t feel what is going on since the vibration is just a MAJOR distraction to the shaving for me. I simply have stopped using this \'feature\'. Every beard is different, every shaver has their own preference. What one loves, another hates etc. Needs are different, results are different. I kind of found all the razor & blade reviews to be sort of useless for me since there are simply too many variables involved in this activity?  But there is one place this series of razor really excels. COMFORT! Vibrate or not, I would really have to want to cut myself, and want to badly to do so. It is buttery smooth for my face. That simply OUTRAGOUS price for new blade refills is somewhat offset by the fact this 5 blade model lasts a bit longer than my single blade safety razor blades. But it still costs so much more, that this return to this razor will end for me, once these blades are done. It is safe, comfortable, and such a close shave, I hate to leave. But retirement pay is just 1/5th of my old working paycheck and this is right at the top of the list for things to cut (bad pun...). Another thing I love about this razor is when I get up in the morning to shave, I have probably only 1/3-1/4th the beard to shave as compared to the next morning if I had used my trusty safety razor.  Bottom line? IF you can afford it and don\'t mind allocating this much money for new blade cartridges, enjoy! It is an amazing tool. I just won\'t spend the money anymore. And another thing, maybe it\'s just me? I see, nor feel, ANY difference in the closeness of the shave either using the vibration feature or NOT using it. When I use it, I really have trouble knowing how well it is cutting. I mean, I have NO sense of if it is cutting or not? Off, it is simply a wonderful razor, but one last time...IF you are willing to pay the high price. Wish I made more money!_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5/28/2010 Update:  OK, I have found another problem with this razor that applies to \'me\' but probably not to the general shaving public? I have several deep scars/crevice wounds to my face from my motorcycle & jet ski racing days (crashes...) This razor simply can NOT get into those areas where a single blade safety razor has NO problem. So if you don\'t have a perfectly smooth (scar free )face, it may not work well for you? I also did some math on replacement blades. Figure around $3.50-$4.00 per refill on this razor. On my safety razor, my blades cost me just 15 CENTS! That 15 CENTS, shaves me perfectly for 7 days. After that, the shave degrades till at 10 days, I no longer have comfort using it. So maybe this can be a guide to the insane cost of using this razor. Bug again, it is such a subjective thing. To someone who has a decent job, they may consider this cost trivial? Or, not even have realized just how out of line it is with alternatives out there. For me, back to the future with a good old safety razor works best. Now I remember why....Take a look at: SHARP STAINLESS Double Edge Polymer Coated Safety Razor Blades for instance. Then look at all the choices for blades in the good old fashioned safety razor. I would give this:- 4 stars for closeness on a smooth face-- 3 stars on a face with scars-- 1 star for cost-  Over all, I let my 4 stars stand since (again),shaving is a very personal & yet subjective thing. One razor doesn\'t fit all.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5/31/2010 Update:Well this will get me some hate mail but I have to downgrade my review from 4 stars to just 3 stars. Reason? I used to get up to 3 weeks of close shaves on the OLD style (see my pictures). This new one with new & \'improved\' thinner blades? Just 7 days and it is cutting me like crazy. But remember, I have to take blood thinner since a recent heart attack. More to the point, I have to ask myself, was this redesign just a way to make sure that the great (but expensive) shave of the old model, would be even better (but ONLY for the manufacturer?) if they discovered a way to get the old design blades not to last so darn long? If so, they REALLY succeeded! This blade is just used up for me after just 7 days. Now my old fashioned safety razor only costs about 15 CENTS. This one? How about $4.25 each????

It\'s fine on the sides and neck but just doesn\'t seem to get very close and is also irritating.  I have absolutely no idea how the vibration is supposed to help - it certainly didn\'t work for me.  I ended up having to use my old trusty Gillette Sensor 2-blade to finish the job.  It\'s just not worth it and I am going to take advantage of Gillette\'s money back guarantee on this razor.    "
2061,2136,20111115,B003987CL0,5,"November 15, 2011",A35C1Y3Z0HWAU0,Baby Skin Smoothness,"I really believe the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor I have ever used. I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn. Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head. I have been shaving my head for 10 years and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head, I couldn\'t believe how baby skin soft my head felt. Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head. I shave my head once a day and sometimes twice. On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times. I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried. I have had no razor burn or cuts with this Power Proglide razor.  I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush. I can honestly say that there is not too much difference with using these shaving gels/soaps with the Gillette Power Proglide.The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin. I can usually get about 5 complete head shaves (several times with the grain and against the grain) and beard shaves  with one razor before I need to replace it. The trimmer is quite helpful to trim around and outline my beard, goatee, mustache and even the occasional eyebrow. The only negative for this razor is the price.If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.    "
2063,2138,20111105,B003987CL0,5,"November 5, 2011",A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H,Terrific,"I was put off by the five blades, thinking what\'s next six or ten or whatever. The gaudy styling...this is no Apple product! The battery...uh, what? Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...But, I needed a razor and the introductory price for the razor and blade is cheap and so I one-clicked it.Only had a day\'s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby and I didn\'t have to go over areas twice. Even glided smoothy and efficiently over the adams apple area. Battery on one side, unpowered on the other. Didn\'t notice a difference.Not a hard test, not enough for a review either, so I didn\'t shave for 4 or 5 days and tried it again. Non-powered on the right side, it was a dramatic improvement over previous multi-bladed shavers. Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better. Just a hair easier. It does help with a thick growth, not a noticeable difference to me with an overnight\'s worth. Of course, this will be different for everyone.Is the motor worth it? Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here. Would two or three blades work just as well? Not likely the cost would be much less, so what the heck, the more blades the better. Play with those blades. They really are very different than anything I have seen before.I really don\'t think I can get a better shave. A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly. I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don\'t take much time doing it. The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it. It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.The little trimmer blade works well.This is a highly recommended product, one that actually may make some difference in your life if shaving has been difficult for you. It is new and better technology.    "

First, the closeness and ease of the shave are noticeably improved over the Mach 3.

With what I consider a medium heavy beard, I\'m well into a third week on the same blades with no noticeable decrease in performance.    "

I lathered up and was amazed as the razor glided effortlessly over my face and through the stubble, giving the smoothest, most comfortable shave that I have had. Not a bit of drag or irritation was experienced, so I let my beard grow for a week, thinking that this time it would fail the standard it now set. To my amazement, the shave was still superb with no irritation. I finally tested it by shaving daily with the same results.Concerning the lubricating strip, it is a definite improvement, being more slick and lasting longer while the handle allows a more secure and comfortable grip than its predecessor. I\'m still on my first blade after 4 weeks and the shave is still very comfortable. The single blade at the back of the blade head does a great job especially above the top and lower lip, and the soft blue glow of the power button does add a cool touch. Shaving was done with the power feature on and off, but either way the shave is excellent.Overall, Gillette definitely has a winner here with the Proglide Power Razor. I\'d definitely recommend it, so give it a try and I\'m sure you won\'t be disappointed!    "

2106,2182,20101119,B003987CL0,1,"November 19, 2010",A2CQSOOMJQJHKA,one star for outrageously expensive razor blades,"This is an excellent razor for times when you need a good shave quickly.  The Gillette multiblade systems are very forgiving of rushed shaving, and truly do a pretty good job.  That said, I\'d need to be able to shave in a tenth of a second to justify $3.50 or more per cartridge.  Seriously, Gillette?For times when you have a little more time to shave, I\'d recommend a good old-fashioned safety razor.  With a little more time for shaving, and a little attention to technique, you can get shaves with an old safety razor that are as good or better than anything you can do with a Gillette Fusion.Besides having razor blades that cost a tenth as much as the Fusion cartridges, a classic styled Merkur safety razor is a solid, well-made tool.  Much more satisfying to use than anything made of plastic.  And a puck of good quality shaving soap might cost $10 or less, and it will last you an entire year.  To top it all off, safety razors are more environmentally sound than the plasticky Gillettes.  No pressurized metal cans of goo, and the double-edged blades are inexpensive to manufacture and to purchase.More tips:  Proraso shave cream in the green metal tube is the best.  Gillette 7 o\'clock sharp edge double edge blades (made in Russia) are great and inexpensive - $34 for  100 at the time of this review.  I\'ve been using a Merkur model 180 for five years now, and love it.    "
2117,2193,20101011,B003987CL0,4,"October 11, 2010",A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,Great--as expected--but way too expensive for me,"I have been a longtime fan of Gillette, having used their razors for easily 95% of my shaving life. I have tried--and rejected--several different Schick razors over the years simply because they were uncomfortable and left me feeling as though I had just shaved with broken glass using battery acid for shaving cream. I always went back to my Mach 3, then Fusion and was pleasantly surprised to see that the Fusion was being re-tooled to be even better.No matter HOW great my shaves have been using Gillette products, invariably I wince each & every time I go into a store to purchase replacement blades. Damn, but they\'re expensive! For some stupid reason, the times when I need a new razor the most seem to be at the moments when I can afford it the least. Weird, but a painful & expensive fact nevertheless.I swore off using Schick products shortly after the release of the Quattro model several years ago. I borrowed my brother-in-law\'s once and on a brand new blade, got a MUCH worse shave than I did using my 1 month old--not to mention rather dull and oft-used Gillette Mach 3 razor. After that I simply gave up even considering purchasing Schick products EVER again. I have always stuck with Gillette since--however, in all fairness I have discovered a 6 bladed razor that I have only found at Walgreens which shaves JUST AS GOOD as my Fusion--not to mention are cheaper (by at least $3 per refill), and would often stick with that in the last year or so when money has been tight.I finally saved up and purchased a Proglide razor recently and found the shave to be pretty much as expected. But as I began to take stock in all the models I have used over the years, I found something interesting...and I went and tested my theory to see if I was imagining it all--and nope, I was right on the money. The simple fact of the matter is this: all things considered, the Mach 3 razor shaves I would say about 98% as close as the Fusion 5 blade razor...and I aslo discovered that the Proglide does not shave ANY closer than the original Fusion. NONE. Considering how freakin\' expensive Gillette products are, and especially how much more they charge for the Proglide than the Fusion, I\'m sorry, but I would expect if the product cost 35% MORE, that the razor would actually perform 35% better, too. Not so. And when I factor in that the much cheaper Mach 3 shaves essentially as close as the other two MUCH more expensive razors, well I think you can figure out where I am going with this...I also discovered quite by accident, that Consumer Reports did their own independant testing and came up with the EXACT SAME results. Interesting, huh?I have one additional thing to add: through the amazon Vine program I received a Schick Hydro 5 razor back in early August. I only ordered it because I figured as long as I would be getting it for free, then at least if I did not like it, I could throw it away and not feel as though I had wasted any money. I was exceptionally surprised when after my first shave I had decided that I would go out and purchase a replacement cartridge right away. Yes, it was THAT good. From what I have noticed having used it now for over 2 months (still on the first original blade, too) is that the Hydro blades stay sharper MUCH longer than ANY previous Gillette product I have used in the past. Imagine my surprise when I went to purchase a replacement 4pack cartridge and discovered it was just under $5 cheaper than the regular Fusion 4pack and nearly $7 cheaper than the Proglides. In fact, it was about the exact same price as what I was paying for Mach 3 cartridges some 5 YEARS ago. Cheaper razors that last longer and still give me a top notch razor-burn-free shave adds up to one very converted former Gillette fanboy.To sum it up: did the Proglide shave great? YES. In fact it was a superior shave all around. Would I recommend buying one? Well, that depends. Personally I doubt I\'ll pay for another Proglide razor ever again. I simply cannot justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper. Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...but I found that for ME, the opposite was true. While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process. Either way, if you have the money, buy what works for YOU and don\'t let anybody tell you different.    "

In sum, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to shorten their normal shaving time.    "

More blades, more power, and whatever else their powerful marketing machine is able to drum up.  However, coming from the standard Fusion line, I can\'t believe the difference this razor makes.  Maybe it\'s the vibration, maybe it IS the thinner blades, but whatever it is, it works.My beard is very coarse and grows like a caveman.  I can be completely smooth in the morning and by 7:00 at night, my face feels like sandpaper.  Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  The ProGlide is like butter.  Easily lumberjacking the thousands of mini pine trees that decorate my face.  This is my first experience with a \'powered\' razor.  I\'ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  Perhaps this is the reason the ProGlide feels to smooth.  Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  My face stays smooth ALL DAY.  I do have to shave the next morning, but if I wanted to, I could go into work (like I did today) with a minor sandpaper face.  However there is a cost for all of this handsomeness and it\'s the cost of those blades.  $3.30/each from Costco.  That\'s outrageous, but my wife does love a smooth face and I can\'t deny her that.    "

They increased the number of blades, but used cheaper and duller blades, so the end result was a lot of grabbing and pulling on my skin, something I never experienced with the Mach 3.  The construction was also cheap, I had a Fusion break apart on me after a year.  I\'ve never had a Mach 3 break, over 10+ years of use.The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  But the trimmer would get clogged with hairs, which is annoying.The Fusion Proglide replaces the Fusion\'s dull blades with sharp blades that don\'t tug or pull on my skin, they just glide through and cut as they\'re supposed to.  Plus, this keeps the trimmer while improving it\'s design to allow hairs to wash away without clogging.    "

During the winter I usually only shave my armpits daily, and since my leg hair doesn\'t grow much in the winter anyway, I only shave them once every week or so.  The small amount of use has probably contributed to keeping the razor clean and sharp.  I leave it in the shower everyday, but I always make sure it stays on a shelf where no water accumulates, so that probably helps too.The moisturizing strip has long since been depleted, but I really don\'t notice a difference in the shave.I usually hold the razor near the bottom and rest my middle finger lightly on top of the actual razor part, because it seems like if I don\'t, it won\'t have enough pressure to get every nook and cranny.  It\'s not really a design flaw; I like it because it gives me a lot more control over the pressure.  The flexible head is AMAZING.  If you\'ve always used cheap one-piece disposables, you are missing out.

I do think that they proglide may be sharper and give a better shave for the first 1-3 shaves but then they seem the same.  I also think the proglide did not last quite as long but can\'t be sure.  I usually got 2 weeks from the regular but only got about 10 days with the proglide.  Reason I can\'t be sure is I skipped shaving and it had to deal with a 2 day growth twice and that may have \'shortened\' the use.  I just wish I could find a razor that was more economical.  I had gone electric but suffered from irritation and when you figure the purchase plus the 2x a year blade replacement (yes electrics need blade replacement too) the cost came out the same.  When the 5 blade razor first appeared a news story did a comparision with the 3 blade.  There was no noticeable difference in the quality of shave that the review panel could feel.  I may go back to the Mach 3 or try a Schick product.  I have always used Gillette razors.  I would give a 4 for quality but knock it down to a 3 because of cost.

I feel more comfortable with it when I\'m shaving in the shower.  It was worth the extra cost to me.When the original Fusion came out I compared to the Mach3, but couldn\'t tell much difference.  With a 2-day growth, I used a fresh Mach3 blade and a fresh Fusion blade, and they both pulled a little.  The only big improvement I could see was the top blade for under-nose trimming.Now, the Proglide is a different story.  I skipped a day shaving and did the same test.  The Mach3 pulled like pliers on my chin hair, but the Pro glided right through.  I think the thinner blades schtick is more than a marketing line.

YES.The advertised thinner blades do make a difference: these is less drag and effort applied when I shave with my Fusion Power blade handle (you don\'t need to buy the new Fusion Proglide Power shaver to use these new blades). I find the shave to be much more comfortable and enjoyable with these new Proglide blades than with the Fusion Power ones I\'ve been using for the past 2 years.Is there a significant difference between the Proglide Manual and Power cartridges? Not that I can tell and not enough for me to fork over the extra money for them. The battery-powered handle makes the difference in the shave in my opinion.Another reviewer mentioned that blade maintenance makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE in the longevity of your blades, and that is true. Always clean your blades with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol after each shave to remove the mineral deposits left by your sink water.    "

If any of you are out there like me the razors of the past just didnt hold up well, tugged at your hair, and had to be thrown away after a couple of uses.  After a couple months of use with my new proglide fusion power it is absolutely the best razors money can buy.  I can shave every morning now without fear of razor burn, tugs, and cuts.  Besides all of that the blades give a me a good shave for a minimum of a month and a half.  Again being a guy with a thick beard this is a godsend!

They just don\'t have the strength to give the strongest shave possible in a longer time.

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.    "

This eliminates razor burn for me and results in a more comfortable shave.I like how the blade assembly follows my face and provides a good shave by keeping the blades at the right angle and in full contact with my skin.  I also like having the one blade side for trimming my mustache and side burns.  The lubricating strip is a nice feature as it improves the gliding motion of the blade head and also acts like a blade wear indicator.  I get a lot of use out of these blades as they seem to me to last longer than other brands and blade designs.Out of all of the types of razors I have used for many years, there is no comparison to the Gillette Fusion.

I shave in the shower because the wet hair is easier to shave than dry hair. I also use the tip of keeping the blade in down so gravity draws everything away from the blades.

What\'s that?  Five blades, you say?  Why, it must be better than four!  Meh.I have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck.  The good news is that, while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the problem.  In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades).  The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area).  If you have sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you.Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra \'trimming\' blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.However, the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast.  Considering my rather fine hairs, I\'m used to exchanging blades once every week or so.  Now I\'m exchanging them twice a week.  Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors\' products, and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to recommend.

I saw the item locally so I purchased it with the intention of shaving with it first thing in the morning.  I am currently a Mach 3 user and I love it so I wondered if this Fusion thing would make a big difference.  I honestly feel that the shave with the Fusion is of the same closeness at the Mach 3.  However the Fusion has a HUGE bonus the extra blade (six) on the back of the shaving headto hit those stray hairs that remain under the nose that the Mach 3 normally misses.  Also it is much easier to trim sideburns with the Fusion because you do not have to worry about hacking off a huge chunk with the mass of 3 blades with the Mach 3.  A bit pricey and if the razor came at the same price as the Mach 3 I would commit to the upgrade, (Very Hard for guys to change hygeine products, we love the good old reliables).  If you do not have a Mach 3 then I recommend purchasing the Fusion.  Bottom line: Close shave, nice sideburn and stray hair trimmer, nice overall design of the handle, and a good looking razor.

While everything else in the world has cheapened up, so has the metal we use in the US. But, for the money, it is the best manual razor I feel out there. I subscribe to auto delivery and save additional money right through Amazon. These razors in a 4 pack at Walmart are $15.97 and I pay $10.38 from Amazon with auto delivery, so why not!. With these tough economical times, why not save a dollar and I wrote this to let other people know about this deal that is available. Thank You.    "

They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.    "

The Fusion does not irritate my skin nor do I get a razor burn with it as I do other brands since I have very sensitive skin. This blade system is so precise I can even dry shave if it is the first use of the blade when I am in a hurry and that would not be possible with any other razor I have ever used, after the first use the blades do dull a bit and I have to use shaving cream or I can get shave burn. The only con I can think of is that they can be a bit pricey if you buy the singles so I would suggest that you either buy the biggest multi pack available to save the most.Update- still the best but I have found an electric shaver that finally gets close to the smoothness, Norelco 3D 1290.

I\'ve been using the fusion razor (mine is the buzzer one - love it) for as long as they have been out. They would last a LONG time, up to 6-12 shaves depending on frequency and amount needed to be shaved. These last on average 2-3 shaves before they start becoming painful. I hadn\'t said anything so far, continuing to give them a chance, but today, I shaved and the blue bar that tells you to replace the razor is gone. One shave, and gone. Now, I know this isn\'t a magical indicator of some kind, but every other fusion blade I\'ve used from the store has had the blue bar on there for about as long as the razor quality lasts. It has been a reliable indicator in the past. One shave! I\'m very annoyed with these razors and finally had to say something.

I\'m 21 years old so I don\'t have as much stubble as say someone twice my age, but my father uses these same blades and his shave is just as good as mine.For the price listed on Amazon, it simply cannot be beat anywhere else. If you go to somewhere like walmart, you get four of these for around $20. With Amazon\'s subscribe and save, you can get 8 blades for $23. There is no reason not to get these. One blade lasts me around 2 months, and I shave every day (in rare cases I may skip a day though).

Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren\'t secured in their package.  Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  And since you\'ve already bought the item, there is no need for overly attractive packaging either.  The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can\'t re-use the packaging from the store).As far as longevity, I\'m probably about as tough of a test case as you can imagine.  I\'ve got thick, stubborn hairs on my next that lay sideways and reverse direction in certain spots.  Every time I shave these razors get a good workout.  When a razor is too worn, it is a painful experience and leads to immense amounts of irritation.  Needless to say, I notice pretty quickly when these get dull, and the razors from Gillette through Amazon take just as long to dull as do the razors from Gillette through the grocery store...this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.  This is the exact same product.  And, if you will still be shaving in a few months, do yourself a favor an subscribe for additional savings.    "

I have sensitive skin that is dry but also tends to itch a lot once new hair growth starts.  I usually have to use a sensitive skin gel with a razor, even the ones that have strips on them.  I decided to use this in the shower on my legs with the gel I had...worried I shouldn\'t use it alone.  Halfway through I ran out of gel so I had an accidental test with this razor alone on one leg and the combo of gel/razor on the other.  The next day when itchiness tends to rear its ugly head, I didn\'t feel any dryness or irritation from either side.  So the Venus works on my hyper sensitive skin.  I was surprised, after two weeks of hanging in the shower on its included hook, be it as high up and away from water drops and steam I could get it, it didn\'t show any telltale signs of rusting, which I have gotten with other Venus line razors.  It has made me take out razors from the shower and dry them then put them in a bedroom door to give them the longest life. Not this one.  I could use this for a long time, well, until the soap wears off, without the blades getting dull or rusting.  I did, however cut the edge of  my ankle with the razor, it is sharp, caution should be taken with it.  It\'s pretty powerful for what it is though I do have fine blonde leg hair.

They\'re not perfect, but they\'re the best that I\'ve found.  When I saw this new Venus Pro Skin, I decided to give it a try because it\'s actually cheaper than buying a new pack of blades (less blades, so more per blade, but cheaper overall) and you get a new handle with it, which is always nice because the handles can get dirty over time.The box opened astonishingly easy.  No scissors required.  This handle is a little bit longer and has more of an angle to it than other handles in the Venus series.  I thought that was nice.  The see-through light blue color was very pretty too.  Compared to my old Venus, this razor looked sleek and shiny.  I become more skeptical when I examined the new razor heads, though. The razor is surrounded by two gel pads.  There\'s nothing backing them, no plastic holding them on.  They move easily up and down as you touch them.  I\'ve had experience with some of these in-head shaving gel products before and have found that they usually completely fall apart or all of the lotion/gel is gone in about two shaves, when of course the razors should last much longer than that.Using the razor I found that it felt very nice on my skin.  I could tell the gel was helping lubricate the skin, but it wasn\'t overly sudsy.  However large strings of gel kept coming off the razor.  This was a little bit gross.  Also the head was too large to fit into tight curves and made it really hard to shave certain spots.  As I expected, one shave used about half of the gel pad, which is a big disappointment.The big test for me is after I get out of the shower, though.  For the first time in ages I didn\'t have any nicks from shaving with a new blade!  I always dread switching blades because I always get cut up.  Also my legs didn\'t itch.  I frequently have trouble with razor burn and itching, and this product actually solved that for me when nothing else has.So where does that leave me?  This product worked wonders for protecting my skin when nothing else has.  I love it for that reason alone.  But the gel pad isn\'t going to last more than a few shaves, which would mean that I\'d have to buy a new head every few days.  That would be ridiculously expensive, but honestly maybe worth it considering how much I do suffer from razor burn normally.  I think if you have problems with razor burn, you should give this product a try.  If you\'re looking for a new handle for the Venus, this one is very pretty.  But if you\'re happy with your current shaving gel routine, these gel pads are bulky and won\'t last hardly any time at all.  For those people, I think this product is a waste of money.    "

It\'s great for people on the go, easy to put in a gym bag etc. It\'s also less stuff cluttering your shower, which I\'m down for. On first use, it works great. Shaves easily, no nicks, close shave. It is a little stringy( seeing little strings of gel from the razor to your skin), but it doesn\'t really make a difference using it, its just a little odd. My legs felt nice afterwards, not parched and dry. But I always follow up with a shea body butter when I get out of the shower anyway, so that\'s never been a big concern of mine.The down side is that the shaving gel bar part is going to be gone long before the razor(maybe after 3-4 uses). I use my Venus cartridges probably longer then most...1: because I\'m not obsessed with the closest shave ever and 2: because I feel guilt pangs whenever I throw something like this in the garbage(trying to be green here!). So eventually I know I\'ll be using this particular razor with my traditional shaving cream despite the fact that it started off easy-peasy. Would I buy it again?

This particular type does not have a strong odor and is gentle on the skin.However, this pack was damaged by UPS during shipping. The individual containers appeared fine in the package.

They fit and work as expected, but they have a problem that bothers me.  For some reason they rattle/buzz loudly when using the vibrating razor.  It\'s as though there\'s too much clearance in the joints or something.  The normal fusion blades did not do this.  So long as it stays on your face it\'s quiet, but listening to this thing first thing in the morning is annoying.  Good price by purchasing in quantity.    "
2689,2773,20111221,B0057D7Y36,1,"December 21, 2011",A25UZ7MA72SMKM,Truly horrible concoction,"I got a sample of this with my Proglide razor trimmer. There were about two shaves worth of this in the sample I received. I used one and immediately threw the rest in the trash.It was like trying to shave with Crisco. It was very oily and hard to wash off my hands. It did the worst job of softening my beard of ANY shaving cream or gel I\'ve ever used, then after the shave, was equally difficult to completely wash the residue off my face.The (brand new) razor blade was left with this stuff gunked up between the blades as if I had run it through a can of solid Crisco shortening. I don\'t know how much hot water (VERY hot) I had to use before it finally all washed out of the blades, but it was far too much.The shave itself was similar to when I\'ve been caught on a trip without shaving cream and used bath soap to lather with, in that it makes it possible, but not comfortable. I\'d rather use bath soap to shave with than this stuff, and I\'m not exaggerating in making that statement.I have used Edge shaving gel for years. In contrast to this product, Edge does not leave an oily residue on my hands, does soften my beard (and my beard is a bit on the tough side), does not need intense scrubbing to remove from my face, and does not imbed itself into the razor blades. With Edge and a new blade, I never have any \'pull\' on a shave. My first, last, and only shave with this mess was an irritating pull on every shaving stroke (yes, with a brand new first time ever used blade).I\'m a big fan of the Fusion razors, but whoever invented this junk, and anyone else in the company that green-lighted it for sale, should be horse whipped.

I shave and trim my beard, so I figured it would be nice to have them all in one. The fact that they come from Gillette gave me the confidence to try it without hesitation about the quality of the product. They did not disappoint - it is a very well made device, versatile and compact and they don\'t force you into buying a new type of razor heads - the ProGlide ones from a regular razor fit. I am glad I bought it!    "

It is difficult to open and press button does not work better. One more change which can be done in future models is keep distance between the detachable arrow and power button. I have average size hands but still it troubles while opening the adapter, power button switches on. As Per shave goes, it is the best product in the market.    "

I\'ve fiddled and hated all stand alone beard trimmers. Either overpriced or left hair in the drain. Or broke. You need to consider shaving/trimming in the shower-- hair goes down the drain. Use a $15 fog free mirror. No more cleaning sinks. No more splashing water all over the sink and mirror. This Braun designed gem is water resistant. PERFECT. Do yourself a favor.

I was worried that the single AA battery wouldn\'t last long but it\'s still going strong after several weeks of use. It easily fits in my medicine cabinet and doesn\'t need a recharger cord which would dictate that it stay on the counter.Overall I\'d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, inexpensive trimmer.

It comes with a handy plastic stand that keeps the trimmer, razor attachment, and three comb attachments all neatly stored on your bathroom counter.  But for travel, it all fits easily into a small toiletries bag.  The included 5-blade razor is quick and sharp by itself, but when you couple it with the vibrating powered trimmer handle, you actually do get an even closer shave, even though it took me a few shaves to get used to the feeling.  The back of the 5-blade razor has a \'precision edging blade\' that lets you precisely shape and edge your sideburns.  Sometimes, depending upon how much I have let my sideburns grow out, I find it easier to just use the powered trimmer without either the razor or comb attachments and using the trimmer by itself does a great job of shaping my sideburns with crisp clean lines.  The build quality is good, with nice styling, and it is great that I can use it in the shower too.    "

Well I just used this tonight (trim and shave) and it works great for both. I\'m totally happy with it and for under $20 for a top tier razor and trimmer, with a great design (especially coming right out of the gate with this brand new product), you can\'t go wrong. Highly recommended. I paid about $18.74 at Walmart and they\'re sold out now. People know and love Gillette!    "

2745,2830,20120129,B0062IWQVU,5,"January 29, 2012",A2JLQBD9IDT5QV,"The perfect daily groomer for your beard, and your hair","I picked up one of these at the local drug store last night after having a coupon to get $3 off. I had a similar styler, but the blades were dull and a pain to groom myself with. It\'s quick, fast and easy to use, helping you to always look your best with all your quick grooming needs.For as cheap as the Gillette styler was, it sure is my new favorite tool to groom with! It\'s got a lot of nice features that more expensive stylers have, but for around only $20, plus it\'s water proof for use in the shower! First off let\'s start with the fact that it uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges, how amazing is that? I can now toss out my old fusion power pro-glide handle since this one works even better. The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates just as well, if not better than the standard power handles on the disposable shavers.The handle is nicely molded, very clean look and provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not hard plastic, so you won\'t find yourself dropping the styler or having it slip out of your palms. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding.You can use the standard motorized blade directly on your skin without worrying about cutting yourself, or scratching up your skin. It\'s sharp, but only for your hair. It also includes 3 different style \'combs\' to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you\'d want to trim. With all these little plastic attachments here and there though, you\'ll need a place to store it all! Gillette is two steps ahead of you, because the packing it comes in also doubles as a stand and accessory holder for the styler itself, and all the little attachments included.One nice thing not many shavers or stylers have is the ability to open the compartment behind the blade to clean out hair that can cause jams. The Gillette styler has a hatch you can pop off, and snap right back down to clean out any hair or gunk so your styler never jams, and will always work reliably. This is a huge plus for me since my old one was becoming weak and dull from all the hair trapped in the mechanism slowing down the blade and motor.Besides the styler and the accessories, I received Gillette brand cooling lotion to use after shaving, and non burning shaving gel. I tried both, and liked them very much. The shaving gel made my hairs pirk right up after a few seconds, making shaving so much easier. I felt no burn or sting while using the gel, so it really does work. Afterwards I put some of the lotion into my palms and rubbed it onto my face where I had shaved, it did have a nice cooling effect, but I could have lived without the lotion, it has a nice light scent to it too.For under $20, the Gillette Styler really can\'t be beat. It\'s cheap in price, high quality, comes with tons of accessories and samples, and it does a good job. It would make a great gift to any guy you know, or a gift to yourself!    "

Does it give a smooth shave...of course it\'s a Venus razor, is this the most expensive cartridge...YES. Is it the best....NO. The Olay strips do not last more than 3 shaves. It was never exposed to direct water so I was really disappointed in them. The very first shave is AMAZING! It\'s so smooth & glides over you skin without even feeling like its touching, by the 3rd shave, it\'s the WORST Venus cartridge I have ever used.Sticking with Venus, but not buying into the hype from the Olay strips!
