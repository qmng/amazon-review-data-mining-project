When new, they give a very nice clean, smooth, and even shave on your face.After that, it\'s a MAJOR pain to clean out the whiskers that get caught between the triple blades.  I had to spend 10 minutes shaking the razor in both standing and running water to clean it out.  Now when you\'re up in the morning trying to get ready for work, you don\'t have that kind of time to spare cleaning a razor.Problem is, if you don\'t clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.Also, even after cleaning, it doesn\'t last very long at all.  On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &quot;indicator strip&quot; sooner.I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem.",,,,

31,32,20110818,B000052YHS,5,"August 18, 2011",A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,"Fast, effective, stupid-proof","The reason to buy this razor is so you won\'t have to think about shaving. There\'s no special technique, it\'s easy to clean, and it\'s disinclined to cut you. It doesn\'t feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I\'m using the same handle, and I\'ve since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can\'t feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don\'t reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won\'t fare as well. I\'ve bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.I\'ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it\'s difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it\'s been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge. Nitpicking, really.A safety razor would probably give you a closer cut, but if shaving is something you dispense with rather than an event to relish, the Mach 3 is where it\'s at.",,,,

47,50,20080313,B000052YHS,2,"March 13, 2008",A2QMXIFIVE4LNS,The best expensive mediocre shave a man can get.,"Mediocre and Overpriced, March 13, 2008By  supernatural (Illinois) - See all my reviewsUnfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems. It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.",,,,

I bought a large quantity thinking they would blow my old razor (Gillette Venus) out of the water. Big mistake. To me these are no different then cheap bics. Initially I was cutting myself constantly, which was never a problem with the Venus. Then the razor burn which was so unbearable that I had to slather my legs in aloe for relief. The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they didn\'t even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs. So I don\'t know if I just got bad batch of cartridges or what, but I think for people who have really sensitive skin this is a total waste of money! Back to Venus!",,,,

Even after my shower I found spots the razor missed. I never had to worry about that with the Embrace.Also, I feel like the blades dull quicker.

At first I thought it was a fluke, but now I know: the blades I purchased from seller bsd sales are counterfeit.  These blades would not stay on either of my Venus razors - the friction from drawing it up my leg was enough to pop it off several times over the course of one shave.  They also did not fit correctly into the plastic they come in; I had to pull the blade out with my fingers instead of pulling it out by the handle like you\'re supposed to be able to do.  Finally, they were so dull that they didn\'t take hardly any hair off of my legs.  I\'ve been using Venus razors for several years now, and I know how sharp they\'re supposed to be out of the box.In conclusion, be careful what you buy.  I know this single one star rating won\'t hurt the popularity of these razors, and it shouldn\'t as they are great razors.

I go between the two as far as replacement blades and whichever is on sale. They are pretty similar, and either of the blades actually fit on either the razors.I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago. I have since tried a few new models thinking that perhaps one of these new razors might work better... but I keep coming back to this razor.The Mach 3 is so far, the only replaceable blade razor that I have found I can easily, properly shave my head without nicks and cuts. The blades tend to wear fairly quickly compared with the Shick Hydro 5, but what is the use of longer lasting blades that slice my head to ribbons?The grip is a great improvement on the Sensor XL, more heft, better wet grip. The blades are easy to attach and remove. They last me a couple of weeks on average, but I shave my head every two to three days and shave my neck below my beard every day. That\'s a lot of use.I did start using a new shave gel and it works magically with the razor. No more issues with serious gumming up of the blades. Check out King of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.. It\'s expensive for a shave gel, but nothing works better for shaving my head and preventing the shave gel/cream from gumming the blades.I know the replacement blades are expensive, and many third party sellers are reselling stolen merchandise... but that\'s part of why they are expensive. Those of us who are buying the blades on the up and up are paying for all those stolen and re-sold packages. So I just recommend buying from a store or trusted seller rather than eBay. Also watch for replacement blades not sold in retail packaging. Often these are either knock offs or have \'fallen off a truck\'. Spend the extra $5 and make sure you are getting the quality blades from a reliable source.",,,,

I\'ve also got the Gillette Fusion 5-blade shaver, and I definitely prefer 3 blades, especially for travel.  Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.",,,,

It does shave very close, but not closer the other 3 bladed razors I have used.  After the 6 months of use, I found that it shaved very well until I had to shave over the edge of my jaw and chin where it failed to give a good clean shave right under my jaw-line and chin with the first stroke.  I found if I try to shave closer, I got to many nicks.  I only got a close shave in those areas after I lathered up again and shave agaist the grain, but at times I did get razor burn doing that.  With out question, my old Gillette Sensor Excel with it\'s two blades did a much better job with only one stroke.  The Sensor Excel seems to huge the surface of my face much better, and the Mack 3 Turbo seems not to keep all 3 blade in contact with my skins surface when going over my jaw and chin.  All in all, I would have been happy with the Mack 3 Turbo\'s shave, it\'s great looks, and I really love the new handle.  And most of the time, if I shave slower I got a great shave after lathering up again and shaving against the grain.  However, I was not happy at all with the way the blade got dull so very fast, and there not cheap!  This is by far the biggest disappointment with the Mach 3 Turbo and the reason I give it only 3 stars.  It\'s also the reason I went back to my Sensor Excel until I got my new Gillette Sensor 3.  I think the Sensor 3 shaves just as close at the Mach 3 Turbo and does ever better in the problem areas under the edge of my jaw and chin.  The Sensor 3 blades are about $1.00 less per pack and last much longer then the Mach 3 Turbo Blades.  And one more good thing, I can use both Sensor Excel Blade and Sensor 3 Blade with both my Sensor Excel and new Sensor 3!  I\'ll keep the new Sensor 3 at home, and keep my old Sensor Excel in my travel bag to use on my many camping and fishing trips, vacation or when ever away from home.

With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one. The cartridges are still available in some stores, however. This review specifically covers the Sensor3 cartridge system.Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor3. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Sensor3 cartridges are noticeably smaller than the Mach 3 cartridges, by comparison. The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.The shave: 3 stars. I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving. I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days\' facial hair growth. The angle of the blade takes some getting used to. I noticed several times that I placed the blade on my face at the wrong angle, presumably because of my adjustment to the Mach 3/Fusion/Quattro razors which seem to have a more linear handle design. The biggest problem I encountered were several cuts. Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors. I do note that the shave was close, but comfort was lacking.Durability: 3 stars. This is the durability rating I give to the Sensor3 disposables. I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges. Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.Overall: The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable). For razor systems, one would be advised to choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.",,,,

I love that they fit on any Venus razor; although, they best match the Divine handle because of the blue text on the blade. They\'re rounded so there\'s no sharp edges. However, they can sometimes be bulky when it comes to feminine curves. Because there are no wires over the blades, the Venus Divine razor is quite easy to rinse off. It doesn\'t have as many nooks and crannies which attract hair, soap or cream like the Quattro blades.Overall, I love the Divine razors. I always get a great shave on my legs and underarms. Those areas don\'t require any shaving cream with Divine\'s multiple moisture strips. I rarely cut myself and irritation around the bikini line and intimate areas is minimal when used with a good shaving cream. The comfort coated blades glide quite smoothly over the skin without catching or scraping, with help from the smoothing cushions. I believe both of those features are only on the Divine razor blades, not the regular Venus blades.The moisture strips add moisture you can touch to the blades (much more-so than the original Venus blades); although, it can feel a bit slimy if you leave it in the shower (the slimyness and moisture both fade over time). The moisture strips are supposed to fade when it\'s time to refill but I\'ve honestly never noticed it so I just replace when I feel like I am not getting an awesome shave anymore.",,,,

I had been using the Mach 3 and Gillette 3 blade disposible (along with Edge Ultra-sensitive gel), but noticed more and more razor bumps. It got so bad, that I had to take the day off from work because I couldn\'t show my totally raw/cut/irritated face.  Needless to say, my skin is sensitive.Well, I didn\'t shave for 2 days trying to baby my skin so it would recover.  The next day, I had to shave so I had to make a decisionAs with most cases, when I need something answered, or need other people\'s opinions, I fired up the good ol\' web browser.  I started by researching electric razors since I heard they were easier on your face, but after reading the reviews, I couldn\'t see spending $150 for something that may not even help and probably wouldn\'t give me as close a shave.I had heard of the Fusion and it did sound interesting to me.  The 5 blade feature didn\'t impress me as much as the fact that the blades are closer together.  I figured if they\'re closer it wouldn\'t give my skin the chance to get between them and be sliced off - excuse my graphic language :) I looked up reviews on the Fusion and found some mention of it being good for sensitive skin.  That did it for me, so off I went to buy a Fusion.When I got to the store, their were rows and rows of empty racks (I would guess at least 20 rows) where all the Fusions had been.  Seems like they\'re very popular with the local crowd.  Anyhow there was ONE left and I nabbed it.Got it home and immediately went in to shave.What a difference!  No razor new razor bumps, and it didn\'t even irritate the old ones (from my Gillette disposables).  No cuts, no irritation whatsoever!  And it really gives you a smooth shave.  Even my wife was impressed with my smooth face!So, moral to this story.  If you have sensitive skin, and you want a really close shave with no irritation, get the Fusion.

Because the main 5-blade setup is so big, some provision had to be made for tight spots like under the nose.  It\'s an old-fashioned single blade. I really don\'t remember when I last used a single blade.  I think that\'s why I dislike shaving. Oww, yes, it\'s that old-time razor burn in spades.So after any shave you can contrast the burn beneath your nose with the smooth, closely-shaved, unharmed skin on the rest of your face.After their big-buck R & D efforts, Gillette needs a way to solve this.(Or use a Mach III under your nose and the new Fusion  on the rest of your beard.)BTW, somehow they seem to have solved the clogged-blade problem that haunted the 4-bladed Shick Quattro.",,,,

This requires more time rinsing between strokes, so it overall doesn\'t save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive, so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it\'s important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades (compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel) helps in shaving large parts of skin, like legs or whatever.  But when it\'s your face with its nooks and crannys, I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort. The 6th blade feature was OK, but didn\'t feel like it was worth it.Remember, that with any NEW blade, you will get an awesome shave.  People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it, because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they\'re reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit----Recently got this as a gift.  Same problems as listed before.  I\'ll just use it until I run out of blades.",,,,

Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other \'detail\' parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front.  It just doesn\'t work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use.",,,,

During that deployment, I managed to use the same blade for 20+ days at a time. Did I mention I also shaved my scalp with the same blade....? Since my return home at the end of 2007, I\'ve been getting a month\'s use per blade on both my face and scalp. I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but, what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long? On the 1st of each month, I replace the old blade with a fresh one. The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months.... You have to admit, that\'s money well spent.I\'ve used all types of blades starting when I was 15...single, double, triple edge blades...Electric shavers, clippers, and even depilatories(which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it, spread it on, wait for it to cure, scrape it off, and wash the excess off my face). I\'ve never had a razor blade that shaved me so close, for so long.To close this review I\'d like to add that I\'ve been on Active Duty in the U.S. Army for 24 years, 7 months & 21 days now and will retire in 41 days (June 30th).

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,

This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it\'s no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn\'t bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I\'m going to calculate the number of shaves I\'ll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.",,,,

After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.)

I always got razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and my facial hair isn\'t even curly. I have tried everything from electric razors, to clippers, to double edge safety razors, and even changing the directions that I shaved. Nothing has ever really worked.  I received a free fusion in the mail, and was skeptical. I tried it, but I still got razor bumps. But then I thought for a second about shaving WITH the grain and NOT stretching the skin, and thought even more about using a shaving brush that I had purchased. I also decided to use a simple, cheap shaving cream, Barbasol Aloe Shaving Cream that I already had in my closet. I found the SOLUTION!  But I should also mention that I shave in the shower with a mirror. I now look forward to shaving, and I feel that shaving everyday is best because it allows your face to grow accustomed to shaving, also allowing the hairs on your face to grow in the direction that you shave, remember-WITH the grain. If you shave with the grain you greatly reduce your chances of having ingrown hairs. If you want to love shaving, and be like that guy who has a perfect shave, get yourself a gilette fusion, a shaving brush, a shower mirror, and a mug. Shave in the shower:Let your face get wet with hot water for at least 2 mins, put some shaving cream on a brush and stretch your skin out (only while brushing)  and brush your beard for 2 mins, fill your mug with hot water and dip your razor in the mug every couple of strokes. Shave in the direction of hair growth, never against and don\'t stretch it, if anything puff up your face! I make two passes, after the first one I re-lather and fill my mug up again with more hot water. And you don\'t need to leave the water on!!! That\'s what the mug is for.

I finally switched to a manual razor.PG\'s Gilette sent me both the Fusion and the Mach 3 free, so I tried them both.  I think P&G\'s Gilette is trying to confuse me.  I like the Mach 3 better than the fusion becasue:1) smaller head makes it easier to get into those small places, true the fusion does have the one rear blade for this prupose but the head was so large that I was not able to get the blade into those hard places.  The Mach 3 was able to get the whole head into most of the small places which certainly beats getting just the one blade in there.2) While the Fusion\'s handle was well balanced so was the Mach 3\'s handle and the Mach 3 had better gripping surface then the Fusion did.3) Lower price on the Mach 3, IMHO, means that the Mach does not need to beat the Fusion just get close to it.  In my test the Mach 3 did better than the Fusion.In terms of the question that I posed in my title, as with everything else in life which is better for you depends on what type of beard you have.  Do you have a heavy beard and have to shave multiple times a day(like Tip O\'Niel) or are you a teen, then the Fusion is probably the best thing for you.  Do you have a moderate beard?  The the Mach 3 is probably more what you need.  Or if you have a light one that does not grow very fast, like mine, then the Sensor or the Sensor Excell is more of what you need.  I think that I am going to go for the Mach 3.I stuck with the electric razors for years thinking that the manual razors would nick and irritate my face.  The may have been true thirty years ago but not now.  Electric razors don\'t give you anywhere near as close a shave as a manual does.As for shaving gell goes, save your dollars and buy the Barbasoll brand.

I even grew a goatee because I could not get a clean shave on my chin. About two weeks ago I received an unsolicited free Gillette Fusion in the mail. I just sat it on my desk and figured I would toss it out eventually. Something inside told me to \'research\' it on the Net. I did and decided to give it a whack come Monday morning (Nov. 6). After perusing these reviews I decided to not buy the Fusion gels. I instead bought the Face Scrub, Shaving Gel and Post Shave Lotion of the Neutrogena Men, Razor Defense line. Let\'s just say I did not know I needed a Face Scrub product. :-)With some trepedition I went ahead with my \'test.\' I could not believe how gently the Fusion glided across my face.

The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves.  That was an excellent product.  However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model.  I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be.  I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none.  I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal?  Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product?  That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one?  If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off.  I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it.  So much for my customer loyalty.

Design, power indicator, its power which seems to be more powerful than the M3, the aloe strip and the extra blade on the back of it! BUT, this thing has one blade too many in the front, this razor WILL CUT YOU if you are not careful! You could probably kill someone with it! The blades on the cartridges are extremely sharp and shaving time increases to over twice the time as with the Gillette M3, due to that extra fourth blade and the size of the cartridge, which forces you to be extra careful and shave very slowly, so as not to cut yourself. If it only had one less blade in the front, it would certainly be the best razor in the world! Gillette, if you are reading this, consider this advise seriously and remove that fourth blade, because you created one hell of a scalpel. I am rating it two stars, despite the many pluses already mentioned, but since its primary and only purpose is to shave, I cannot honestly say it does a good job.

I have been using Gillette sensor-series products almost exclusively since the Gillette sensor debuted in 1990.I graduated from Sensor, To Sensor II, to Mach 3, to Mach 3 power.I normally shave wet, with no shaving cream, and with down strokes, although I use some upstrokes. I have tested the Mach 5 both wet and dry, with no cuts or major problems.I have used the Gillette Fusion for 1 week, and here are my findings.Pluses:1) An overall great shave.2) The Fusion shaves better dry than any previous Sensor model. (Although I rarely have a reason to shave dry).3) More blades. More microfins!4) The plastic handle, while bulky, is very nice. The plastic is gentle to the touch, aa nice departure from the rigid, cold metal of the M3.5) Comes with a coupon for $2 off additional cartridges.Minuses:1) The confort strip wear out WAY too quickly.  My Mach3 blades last 3 weeks, My Fusion blade needs replacement after 1 week. Hopefully, the replacement blades will be better than the original ones (if so, I\'ll edit this review).2) Since there are more microfins with a larger area, and sincen the microfins become more imporant to the overall shave, the microfins trap more hairs than ever. Even washing the blade doesn\'t get rid of all of the microhairs trapped in the microfins.3) The 5 blades make upstrokes more difficult and don\'t offer the precision of the M3 and previous models for the tough spots (e.g. under the nose). On the soft ares of the face (e.g., the cheecks), the larger footprint makes it harder to press close and cut hairs close to the skin. However, this problem is somewhat offset by the additional blades and microfins.4) As always, the blades are more expensive than previous version. At this rate of inflation, Gillette blades will cost $50 each by the year 2030. =)Overall, it is a great product. I am undecided if I will keep using Fusion or switch back to the M3 as my primary. I might use both together (as I previously did with the M3 and Sensor Excel).",,,,

It\'s one of those things that I don\'t like to do.

Like others have mentioned, it is a bit bigger so a bit tougher to get under the nose....but it\'s doable.  The extra edge blade on the top is kind of cool...but I have only used it a few times.I think the three things that make this work are (1), battery vibration, (2) part under the blade that hits your skin first before the blades do....seems to lift the beard so blades cut better and, (3) five blades...5 makes a difference but the big difference is the closeness of the blades.  It seems this closeness makes it less likely that the blades cut me.  I seem to get less razor cuts.The only drawback I can see is the cost...I have had a hard time justifying the cost of razors in the past...seem too expensive, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.I highly recommend you try it.

While I was impressed with the Mach 3, and more so with the Mach 3 Turbo, when I switched to the Quattro, I knew that was the razor for me. Close shave, smooth glide, rarely any cuts at all even on my difficult-to-shave face. Recently when I went to the store, they were out of the 4-pack of Quattro blades, and so instead of buying an 8-pack, I decided to try this brand new razor from Gillette. I\'d never had a 5-blade razor before (let alone a battery-powered vibrating one) and so I decided to go all out, even though I was very disappointed to find that the cartridges cost $3.50 EACH.It comes in a nice easy-to-open clamshell package with a cheesy-looking but convenient holder that can either lay flat or stand vertically, which is what I prefer. It comes with a battery, which was very easy to install, and is touted as being shower-proof. I wouldn\'t know, because I don\'t shave in the shower.The vibration was not at all what I was expecting. I don\'t really know what I was expecting since this was my first powered razor, but when they say \'gentle micro-pulses\' I think of a soft intermittent buzz. Not so. This razor is strong, and it vibrates like a cell phone, constantly, insistently and very noticably. I was surprised by how strong the vibration was for a small appliance.I used my standard Gillette foam shave cream, and set to work trimming my face. The first thing I noticed is that I couldn\'t really feel the razor on my face as it vibrated and shaved my whiskers. The second thing I noticed is that I also couldn\'t feel when my face was clean-shaven while the razor was vibrating. I rely on the way the razor feels and sounds on my skin to know when I\'m done shaving a spot, and the vibration drowned out any noise or sensation or any other feedback I might have gotten from the razor. However, it didn\'t make that much of a difference, because I had to go over the same spots four or five times in order to make them clean-shaven. I\'m not sure what the 5th blade is doing, but I don\'t have to shave the same spots that many times with even an old blade on my Quattro. However, when I was done, the final result was a pretty good shave, with a few nicks here and there--the Fusion doesn\'t work well with bumps on the face when vibrating.I also used the single trimmer blade on my sideburns. It seems to work as advertised, and it is easy to use for accurate trimming of the sideburns. The problem, however, is that the single-blade end is no good for shaving a larger area such as your entire moustache, but the five-blade side is way too large for such a task. I found it very awkward to shave my moustache area with either end.Bottom line: I will be returning the Fusion and exchanging it for a set of replacement cartridges for my Quattro. It still outperforms the Fusion in spite of having one less blade in the area of comfort and shaving sensation, and the cartridges are $1.50 cheaper each. I may go back to the Fusion sometime, but if I did, it would be the manual version, never the vibrating version. This was my first and last experience with a battery-powered razor.",,,,

BOY, was I wrong.  It\'s been written in a few other reviews here, but it bears repeating:  This is easily the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had.  Moving with the grain, it doesn\'t even feel like a razor is touching your face.  Even going against the grain, there\'s smooth action and no nicks.the only problem i had was with the head being a little too big to effectively catch the area under your nose.  HOWEVER, there is a single blade on the back of the cartridge for this exact purpose.  I applaud Gillette for the research and customer feedback that went in to the design of this razor.I hate to sound like a commercial, but my wife felt my face after I shaved, and she said that it was the smoothest my face has ever been.

Oh I\'m sure Gillette spent big bucks to make the fusion power blades stand up to the imense stress and vibrations that occurs during the blades one week lifespan.Most likely they just think people are stupid enough to either want the color coordinated ones or that customers will think something bad will happen if you use the non-power version blades. Or people will think the power ones are better.  Bottom line: Gillette thinks you are gullible. Buy the non-power blades.The overall shave is good if you shave everyday.

But with my ever increasing stubble, I wanted to find an alternative.I found this one at Kroeger and decided to give it a try. I was very impressed with the shave, it was very smooth and much more comfortable than any two blade razor. What was most impressive was it cut far less than the other razors. The turbo option doesnt really improve the shaving experience though and so I shave without the turbo power. I do have to shave on the same spots again but I do not feel any discomfort as compared to the other razors. The trimming blade too is useful especially when working on the sideburns and underneath the neck, but it takes some time to figure out the \'correct\' way of holding the handle in this position.But alas, all good things have a price and this one might be too expensive in the long run. I will have to see how many shaves my blades last to get the economics right.In short, if you are still stuck with two blades and want to move to better options, I highly recommend this razor if you can afford the blades in the long run.

I mean, really, if you\'re a man and you\'re reading this, you probably already own/use Gillette products.  It\'s a given.  They really are the best.  They are also really the MOST EXPENSIVE.I used the regular Gillette Fusion for years now - and just made the \'leap\' to get the Fusion Power.  Why now?  I mean the blades are ridiculously expensive as it is, what\'s another buck or two on top of that?!Tried it for the first time today.  It works well.  The vibrating is a bit weird - it\'s like a hand massage while you shave.  Shaving doesn\'t feel like shaving.  That vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with.  It certainly is painless to use.  It worked well - my skin is smooth.  No telling if it\'s smoother than the regular Fusion.  How could you tell?  I don\'t know if it\'s a gimmick or what - but I did like it.  I\'ll continue to use it, since I bought the darn thing and have no choice.~ EDIT 4/23/2010:  I now hate this thing.  Here\'s why: Within one or two shaves, the \'lubricating strip\' is completely gone.  After that first shave with a nice new blade, it hurts like hell to shave with.  It\'s as if the vibrating effect speeds up the wear and tear on the blades!  It\'s horrible.  It truly is.  On the weekends, after a couple days growth, shaving with this thing is horrendous - I\'ve never had a more painful shave.  The vibrating thing is just a gimmick: aside from that first shave with a new blade, it\'s not nearly as good as the other non-vibrating shaving razors out there.  I find areas all the time that it just did a horrible job on - rough spots.  I can\'t use it on my upper lip - because the vibrating makes my lips chap!  Even turned off, shaving HURTS with this thing!  I\'m throwing it out.  I had this old spare new Schtick razor I keep around and shaved with that a few days ago - WOW.  It\'s awesome!  So smoooooth.

I found I could shave a little faster with this blade.Slightly less comfortable for me: the blades pull my hair just a little, the vibration is a little too strong (I\'m somewhat sensitive to vibration in my right hand) and I found the handle more likely to get slippery in the shower vs. the M3 Power.I found the trim blade to be a good addition for under the nose and sideburns.",,,,

I have purchased a Mercur safety razor which I think will hold me over for a good forty years as it is a tried and true antiquity, is a single blade, and the said blades cost like a buck for ten at Longs (standard double edge). Horrendous value cartridge-wise and not really a terribly good shave to boot. I really should probably have given it a one star, but hey, it works.

Just get the thing on my face and move it and it does the job even on my chin, under my nose, off my jawbone and in those other spots where lines are hardly flat or straight. The razor has another cutting edge on the back you can use for straight cuts to sideburns or elsewhere,  if you choose.I cut myself a few times the first time I used Fusion and was concerned the five cutting edges may be too much for me.

Maybe that\'s where the advances end since I could not tell a difference in shaving between this razor and the Schick Quattro and M3Power razor.  I don\'t feel like it gets a closer shave.  In fact, I don\'t notice any advantages in this razor at all.If you have never used a \'Power\' razor before, try it.  The vibrating that is put off by the batteries is very slight but definitely makes for a closer shave. Battery life is long, and one advantage this razor has is a low battery life indicator. That\'s about it though. The trimmer that was hyped so much is pretty much useless.  I am not a very hairy guy, but I tried it on my sideburns and it didn\'t do anything. Maybe I wasn\'t using it correctly but I couldn\'t tell what it was supposed to do.  As for under the nose, it was worthless there too.The major disadvantage of this razor are the blades.  You\'re going to pay an average of $3 per blade! Considering a blade lasts two weeks at most (which is how often you should replace them, regardless of whether they still work), prepare yourself for a $60 a year razor budget.  The M3Power blades are only $2 a blade, and backwards compatible with previous razors.If money is no object and you don\'t already have an M3Power, this isn\'t a bad razor, but it\'s not nearly worth the hype and price when compared to its predecessor.",,,,

Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice. The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price. This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you\'re only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her, which she thinks is a must. Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The \'ease of use\' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter. Easier than oral, rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data, and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep, which caused my wife to scowl and panic, but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself.

Recently I asked my girlfriend to pick up some razors at the store \'not cheap ones please\' and boy was that a mistake. Anyway, I happened to be on Amazon already buying something so I looked at razors and decided on this one. I actually didn\'t know that it was a battery operated razor. I had used a Gillette razor before and it gave me a good shave. So when I got this one with the battery and stuff I was kinda skeptical but figured it would shave good without the vibrations so I didn\'t have to turn it on to shave if I didn\'t want to... I thought maybe it would just carve up my face like a Halloween pumpkin. The first time I used it I was very pleasantly surprised. I figured maybe it was just because it was a brand new blade, which always shave great the first time. I am here writing this review now because after a week and a half of using this thing with the same blade, it\'s still shaving closer than any shave I\'ve ever had before. Really. I have had close shaves before but could still feel where the hair would eventually come back again meaning it was close but like it was only cutting the hair even with the skin and this one seems to cut it even lower if that makes sense. I can\'t believe how smooth my face is. Truly smooth as a baby\'s butt. I have to actually take my time and pay attention now more than before, because if I miss a spot, I can really feel the difference. My girlfriend has really noticed the difference too... (don\'t tell her I said this but it\'s almost annoying how much she is touching and kissing my face now. lol)I didn\'t get any replacement blades with my original order, but I\'ve been looking at the local stores and all the prices have been twice what I see here on Amazon for replacement blades. The actual razor is about the same, but I laughed when I saw 4 replacement blades at Rite Aid for the same price I just bought 8 here on Amazon. I think I\'ll buy some more replacements to have on hand when I go traveling next month.I have no idea what the last reviewer is complaining about.

Like all other variants, you can swap the razor blade and handles, which is convenient. The Embrace blade head has a large design. It\'s still more narrow than say, the Hydro Silk, to you\'ll ultimately need to make more passes because of the narrow path. However, the larger head didn\'t seem to impede shaving very much. I did notice that it tended to bend the wrong way when I was shaving from certain angles, which causes it to drag over my skin. I expected some irritation from it, but nothing happened. It feels a little weird when that happens, but there\'s no lasting effects.I get as good a shave from this as my Venus Divine, which I have always liked. This one has added an extra blade, but I\'m not sure if the shave is that much closer. This design is supposed to be more moisturizing, however. This is due to a large moisturizing strip that surrounds the blades themselves. I noticed that it felt, well, slimier upon first use. The moisture quickly dried up, however. Whenever I step into the shower to use this after leaving it sit, it gets a little moist once again, but it doesn\'t last. In my opinion, I wouldn\'t count on using this without shaving cream for any area other than under your arms.With that said, I\'m not ready to switch over from my Venus Divine.

I put a new blade on the Vibrance, so that both razors were starting out on as level a playing field as possible.There was very little noticeable difference in performance. Both razors shaved my legs smoothly. The only drawback to the Embrace is that it has a slightly larger head, which makes it a little difficult to maneuver around knees and other tricky areas. I saw no difference in closeness of shave between the three and the five-bladed razors; and a few days later, I saw no difference in the amount of stubble.Overall, I\'d say that if you are a first-time Venus buyer, the Embrace is a fine choice; but if you already have a Venus razor, the Embrace really isn\'t an upgrade, and there\'s no reason to buy it.",,,,

942,969,20080402,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 2, 2008",A3H7ADUP07D93H,Works great but no better than Venus Divine,"When I was growing up razors were a simple affair.  A single blade and that was that.  I remember the first ads when double blades started showing up.  The idea, according to the advertisers, was simple: the first blade would pull the hair so that the second blade could cut it closer to the skin, something that to me defied all logic.  I didn\'t have to worry about it for a long, however, as after a while I switched to depilatories.About a year ago I decided to switch back to shaving and went to buy a razor.  To my dismay, pretty much every model had four blades. What in blazes did anyone need all those blades for?  The heads of these razors were huge.  And why stop at 4?  Why not 6, or 8?  All I wanted was a simple double-bladed razor.  No luck.  I ended up getting the Gillette Venus with three blades and I\'ve been quite happy with it.  Seems someone at Gillette, however, thought that more would be better, or at least more profitable, so when I saw this new red five-headed beast offered through Amazon Vine, I thought I\'d give it a try and see if it was all just marketing hype.  I mean, what the hec? You can always use another razor around the house, right?.  To tell the truth though, I wasn\'t really expecting to like it.  I figured it would be bulky and awkward and just not worth the extra cost of the replacement cartridges.Turns out that this is quite a nice razor in spite of the extra size of the cartridge, which is definitely larger than the three-bladed ones.  First of all, I should point out that all Venus razors accept all Venus cartridges.  I was able to swap cartridges just fine between the new Embrace and my old Venus Divine.  It doesn\'t matter whether you bought a plain Venus, a Venus Divine or a Venus Embrace razor.  You can use any of the replacement cartridges with any of the razors.  The biggest difference between the cartridges is not the number of blades, but the amount of lubrication, as I discovered when I accidentally ordered plain Venus replacement cartridges instead of Venus Divine cartridges.To test out this new razor, I compared it to my old Venus razor with a new plain Venus cartridge, using the new razor on one side of my body and the old one on the other.  Much to my surprise, there was a huge difference in effectiveness as well as comfort between the two, with the Embrace cartridge coming up with much more hair.  Also, the lubrication seemed to smooth over the rough edges of any dull blades.  When you have this many blades, some of them are bound to be dull, but at a cost of about three bucks a pop, you don\'t want to have to throw one out.Okay, this is way too long a review for a stupid razor.  In short, both the Divine and the Embrace are great, better than plain Venus cartridges.  If you already have another Venus razor, though, there\'s no need to buy a new one.  Just get a pack of replacement cartridges.Oh, and by the way -- the blade holder thingy fell off my tile in less than 10 seconds and only holds two replacement cartridges anyway.  Gillette should scrap these things, which are just going to end up in landfills.",,,,

Well, I don\'t remember the name of the type I was using just prior to this - it has, I think, 4 blades and a waxy-looking purple strip of \'moisturizer\' above and below the blades section - but this new one, the Venus Embrace, doesn\'t do any better or worse a job than the previous types of blade.  I have always liked the Venus blades and I\'ll keep buying whichever type is available at the store, but if you\'re happy with your old Venus there\'s really no reason to change to this one.  Oh, it does come with a little suction cup thing to mount it on the wall of the shower or next to the tub - that\'s kind of nice.All in all, does a great job, just like I\'ve come to expect from Venus and Gillette.",,,,

The razor gives the expected 5-blade smooth shave. I tried it myself -- on my face, sillies! The soft green palette is pleasing to the eye, and the shaped handle has a rubberized grip that makes it easy to grasp when wet. The head is large and contoured, ideal for mowing down wide swaths of follicular profusion. The shower caddy is a neat idea. It is backed by two suction cups for gripping the shower stall (tip: works better when wet) that conceals a small, swing-out storage space for extra blades. The swing gets loose easily, so careful! I can\'t speak about price, but typically, 5-blade replacements are fairly expensive, unlike those for my trusty Trac II. Nice product, if the blades last more than a shave or two!",,,,

She used her three blade razor on one leg and this on the other, and, on a blind test, I determined that the leg shaved with the three blade razor felt smoother.  And the Venus Embrace left her other leg looking red and irritated -- it felt a little roughed up.  My wife pointed out that the huge \'moisturizer\' surrounding the blades makes it impossible to do any fine trimming.  Also, she didn\'t like the shower mount or the amount of packaging on the \'shower safe\' replacement blade.  It seems wasteful.  And who changes the blade in the shower instead before starting the water?  Sometimes less is more, and fewer than five blades certainly seem do to a better job for shaving.

I was pleasantly surprised once I used the razor. The shave was so smooth that I actually thought it wasn\'t working until I checked the razor and my leg. The five blades do a great job of shaving. It did take a few attempts for the shower pod to stick on the shower wall, but once it did stick the razor fit neatly into the pod and it proved to be very handy. The blades face against the shower wall, so there\'s no fear of accidentally brushing against it and cutting yourself. The fact that there\'s room inside the pod for extra cartridges is terrific, in case you need to change the cartridges mid-shave. It is very easy to change the cartridges, which is a plus.

I dunno if it\'s because I grip it too hard or what... but this is the BEST razor I\'ve used by far, and I have no choice but keep buying them.",,,,

While it does work on my legs, I wouldn\'t say it\'s noticeably more impressive. But for me what really mattered is that it is SO hard to use on my underarms. I have to pull the skin across the bone and then  try to shave to get the lower part of my underarm because the thing is too bulky and there is way too much plastic to get a smooth shave. Since I can get a smooth shave with a cheapy razor, I think I\'d rather stick with that.",,,,

However . . .,"I\'ve used Venus razors for years, and the Venus Embrace is a cut above the more standard Venus offerings.  A gel handle makes this razor easier to control than previous models. No nicks, No razor burn, and the moisturizing ribbon around the blades helps the razor glide very smoothly.  So why not rate it five stars?Two problemsFirst, the pod that is supposed to stay on the shower wall doesn\'t.  At least, on my shower wall, it stays for only three hours.  Then I hear \'bump, clank,\' and it\'s down again.  After three trys, I gave up!  The extra blade will stay in the cabinet until needed.Second, the price of additional blades is high. You\'ll have to decide if the extra performance of this razor (nice) is worth the $3.00+ for a refill blade (not so nice in my book).Will this razor replace my earlier Venus razors?  Probably not, but, of course, this is a personal issue, so you\'ll be the judge.Four stars",,,,

I have very sensitive skin, and am very prone to rash and break outs, so I was excited to try it.  I was a little dissapointed to find myself having an almost plastic burn from all the excess plastic they pack around the blades~~and while it\'s true the 5 blades give you a smooth, great shave, they almost shave too close.  I felt several times like I had razor burn, and actually skipped shaving under my arms one day because of the irritation.  I actually tried to give this the benefit of the doubt, and used it for several weeks, using several extra blades...I was just not impressed.  The shave was too close, resulting in bumps and an uncomfortable burn on my legs and underarms, not too mention the bikini area.  I want a smooth shave, but I don\'t want razor burn.I did, however, really like the grip and feel of the handle of the razor, and loved the handy dandy shower caddy, with the suction cups, and little cubby for extra blades.

It had 5 blades, a surrounding cushion, a grippy handle, and it shaves beautifully.  I can\'t complain.  However, I\'ve been using a Venus for several years -- one with 3 blades -- and *it* shaves beautifully too.  The last time I shaved, I used both razors, one at a time of course, to see which performed better.  I really saw/felt no difference between the two.  The Embrace\'s 5 blades are smaller in width than the other razor\'s 3 blades.  The head of the Embrace is larger, supposedly to offer more cushioning.  But the difference between the two razors\' ability to shave really isn\'t noticable!  They both did a fine job!  So if you have an older-style Venus, you might as well keep using it.  No need to upgrade if you like the razor you already have.  And for those of you who haven\'t tried Venus razors, they allow you to give your legs safe, smooth shave.  I would recommend this product if you don\'t already have a razor you like.Edit: After several months of use, I can warn you... never leave this razor face-down on any surface (countertop, edge of bathtub, etc.)  The material surrounding the blade will stick to that surface and, when you try to pick up the razor, the material will rip like paper and leave a residue on the countertop or wherever (it can be removed, but it\'s sort of annoying.)

Then I tried the Venus Embrace Razor.  I will never go back to my original razor choice again.First thing I noticed was how the Venus 5-blade razor with its ribbon of moisture \'zipped\' across my skin and removed all the hair smoothly, easily, quickly, and completely on the first stroke every time.  I had not even realized the \'drag\' I was experiencing with my original razor choice until I felt how smoothly the Venus razor did its work. I had just shaved my legs the previous day, but my razor had \'given out\' just before completing my shave and one leg had not gotten a smooth shave.  Trying Venus Embrace the next day, not only did I get an immediate and smooth shave on the \'unfinished\' leg, but on reshaving the \'completely shaved\' leg, I found that that I actually had not gotten a really thorough shave on it the day before either.I have always resisted those shaped, fat-handled razors because they look bulky.  My regular razor was thin and straight-handeled.  Now I see what all the hype is about.  The handle is comfortable, fits perfectly into the hand, is soft to the touch, and is wonderfully positioned.  It just feels \'good\' in my hand.  Actually it feels \'great\'.No \'suctioned-cupped\' item has ever seemed to work for me.  If they stuck at all, they were generally on the floor the next day.  Therefore I originally didn\'t intend to even try the showerpod.  After reconsidering how helpful it would be to have all my shaving utensils available inside the tub/shower area, I positioned it where I thought it would be handy if it would stick and affixed the suction cups.  Voila, it not only stuck, it is still there weeks later, never having come \'unstuck\' even once.While I regret my stubborness to give the newer-styled ladies razors a chance; I am completely sold on this Venus Embrance razor and anticipate it will be a long time before I think about changing razor brands again.",,,,

The suction-cup pod holder which attaches to the wall is a nice touch. Far preferable to an adhesive strip that would undoubtedly leave a residue mark after removal.Smooth shave, nice design - not really suited for bikini-line due to the wide border of plastic around the blades - but nothing really to complain about.

It\'s a nice entry -- it gives a nice shave with no nicks or cuts, and it\'s attractive. It even comes with a cute \'showerpod\' that attaches to your shower wall and holds the razor.However, there are several downsides to the Embrace:* The razors don\'t last long at ALL. I shaved my legs twice without replacing the head, and the second time was really not that satisfactory. In addition, the refills are PRICEY! They end up being over $2 apiece at the Amazon price or more than $3 apiece at the regular retail price.* The multiple blades trap longer hairs, so if it\'s been more than a couple of days since you\'ve last shaved your legs (so sue me -- it\'s not exactly shorts weather in Michigan right now!), you\'ll find yourself CONSTANTLY rinsing out the head. This gets old very, very fast.I think I\'ll be sticking with my trusty old Mach3. It\'s not as cute, but it does as nice a job, and the refills are a heck of a lot cheaper.",,,,
1056,1085,20080414,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 14, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,Great Razor,"I have thick hair which grows in rather quickly. I have tried probably most hair removal products on the market. This includes a huge number of razor types, hair removal gels, buffers, sanders, yankers, radio signal needles, and much more.I admit that when the first more-than-two razor blades came out, that my boyfriend and I thought of them as a silly gimmick. The only reason we tried one is that a friend of ours worked at Gillette and I wanted to give her some feedback on how they worked. We thought it would be a wash. We were quite surprised that it did actually provide a better shave.In a way, it makes sense. The whole reason to have multiple blades is that hair is not all orderly and in a line. The first blade might cut off some of the hairs, but some will just bend beneath it. That bending then creates tension for the second blade to be able to cut it.If you only needed two blades, then you could do a single pass with a two bladed razor and have it completely clear all hair in its path. Of course, that doesn\'t work - at least not for me! When I then tested out a three blade razor, it definitely cut more hair on the first pass. Also, because you now have more \'cutting power\', you don\'t need to press as hard.So does this logic move on to give blades? Again, I was a little skeptical. First, the ergonomics of this razor are just GREAT. I\'ve tried many, many types of razors over the years. They can be very slippery in the shower. This one has a super combination of shape and texture. It fits nicely in the hand, and stays there securely.I also really like the wall attachment that this tucks into. The attachment holds spare blades as well. It stays securely on our shower wall and is easy to put the razor in and out of.So how well does it work? I\'ve tried it with a variety of soaps and gels. It slides smoothly and with the five blades it cuts thick hair with just one draw, without much effort. The without much effort part is really key. It means you get far less cuts, because you are not pressing down into skin bumps or goosebumps. You don\'t get razor burn because the blades are not dragging hard along your skin, slicing off the top layer.I haven\'t had any problems using it on any part of me. Underarms, legs, ankles, you name it. I would most definitely rather have the five blades with its gentle cutting power vs a smaller version. Heck, smaller razors with two blades *do* exist. There\'s a reason I use this one instead. It simply works better.Highly recommended.",,,,

Adding any more blades after that just is not worth it.  It just doesn\'t make sense how expensive these refills are.

These were the real thing...this time. I have gotten a pretty bad batch off Ebay once and I have heard some of the Amazon sellers are offering fakes as well. I guess a good rule is don\'t throw down a lot of money thinking you are getting a really good deal. Avoid buying 40 or 80 counts because if you are wrong, then you are out a ton. Also, if you get screwed on Amazon make sure you go back to the exact page you bought from and hammer them. Let people know who the bad apples are. Be careful not to smear the folks that are selling the genuine product. I think you will be ok buying from THIS seller.",,,,

I\'ve never used Turbo and I\'m not sure what it would add to my shaving successes, so I figured I didn\'t want to pay more for this feature.Amazon had the best price I could find on the regular Mach3, but when I received them I must say they look different than I remember.  They seem to be made of cheap black plastic, I could swear the ones I bought in retail stores felt better made.  I dropped my razor in the shower recently and the metal tabs that hold the whole thing together bent and tweaked the cartridge -- this had never happened in years of dropping store-bought Mach3s.  And it might be my imagination but it seems like I am needing to change blades more frequently, as if the blade is a poorer grade metal that dulls or corrodes faster.I can\'t prove it but I suspect Gillette is trying to phase out this product to steer consumers to a more expensive update, and is manufacturing a cheaper version for guys like me who cling to this product in hopes of avoiding the more expensive update, but the spotty quality will probably push me there eventually anyway.",,,,

When I first opened it, it took me a good 5 minutes to realize that it wasn\'t one of the solid bar deodorants. I had no idea how to use it and it took me quite a while to figure it out. The turning mechanism on the bottom can be frustrating because when you first use it it is difficult to make it work. Another problem is that it is really messy. While applying it you have to keep turning the bottom wheel for more gel to come out which can get annoying. After you are done it really messy and easy to get on your hands, chest, and even the actual container. However it is a very strong and powerful deodorant. It felt great and I could smell it\'s freshness the entire day. Without applying too much even it worked exceptionally well. This is the first time I\'ve ever used a gel deodorant, and I think I might just stick to it. If it\'s possible you should buy an individual one before you get a multi-pack to try out.

You put it on and it stays on, it\'s completely invisible. With other deodorants you will begin to smell your body odor permeate through the inferior deodorant after a few hours. With Gillette Clear Gel, there is no body odor, ever. If I wanted to, I could go days without showering and it would keep working strong the whole time.

I don\'t want to smell like my deodorant, and the Cool Wave fragrance is very subtle. Also, my wife likes the smell, so that is an obvious plus!3) It seems to last longer than other brands including other gels. I tried AXE but found their clear gel to take more layers of application to work with the same effectiveness as Gillette.4) It doesn\'t degrade or melt when taken around in a gym bag. Over time some of the other gels I\'ve bought lose their texture or melt if they\'re not kept cool enough. I don\'t have that problem with Gillette.

First thing he noticed was that he had to turn the wheel (pushing the product upward) many many times to get it to reach the surface where it could be used.  Therefore, it is obvious that the container is not completely full, and therefore the user is actually getting less product than the size of the container would imply.  The directions say \'three clicks.\'  Yeah, right.  That may be true after the first use, but certainly not true for the initial use.  Also, the name of the anti-perspirant includes the words \'advanced solid,\' but the stuff that exuded from the little holes in the top sure looks like a thick cream.Other than that, all he could say about the product is that it seems to be a perfectly adequate anti-perspirant.  Even though he is a very active guy, he was neither negatively nor positively impressed.  Maybe he had a rather neutral reaction to it because he is just not the type of guy who stays awake at night wondering if he has damp spots on his shirt in the summertime that might gross-out his coworkers.In any case, he felt that the product does the job, but he wondered if it was worth the price differential over other brands.

It was basically because the antiperspirant does not let your pits sweat at all, that they are basically blocking your the sweat glands which can lead to an infection.It may be different for, but for me I sweat easily despite being skinny, and non clinical strength ones do not work as well/barely for sweating. So use at your own risk/are not as often as you would with normal onces, I would advise everyone, from personal experience to not use these at all. Having effects in your pits suck.",,,,

The razors were ordinary razors, from Gillette. Those razors don\'t come into this tale. But attached to the outside of the pack of ordinary razors was one special razor, a sample of another razor model. This is its story.At first, the special razor lay in the bathroom drawer, watching as ordinary razors were used and thrown away, used and thrown away. It was a lonely existence as the only one of its kind. No bright colors or fancy features made this razor stand out from the crowd. Razors came and razors went as the tough-bearded man shaved his sensitive face.Then one day it was the special razor\'s turn.The first shave was fine, a nice close shave that didn\'t sting that sensitive face. It might even have ended that day, if the rough-bearded man had thrown the special razor in the trash. But he didn\'t, for he was frugal too.The second shave was fine as well.And the third. Unusual, thought the rough-bearded man.But the fourth time he shaved his sensitive face with the special razor is when he began to suspect that this razor was special, indeed. What razor stays sharp for four shaves? And a disposable too! The man felt his smooth skin and wondered if it could be. He set the razor aside just in case, on the slimmest hopes there could be another smooth shave. How wonderful, how magical that would be!The next day came, as they always do. And the rough-bearded man lifted the special razor to his sensitive face. And shaved.No pulling! No stinging! A smooth and silky shave! It was all true. Then the rough-bearded man knew that this was not merely a special razor. Nay, this was indeed -- a Magic Razor!He asked the razor its name. The razor said, \'Gillette Custom Plus 3 Sensitive\'.The rough-bearded man with the sensitive face smiled a wide smile with his smooth skin. Some say the razor smiled too.The End",,,,

The Sensor Excel blades were the first among Gillette razors to add rubberized \'microfins\' at the bottom of the cartridges...a standard they have included on every Gillette produce since Excel\'s debut. But with so many razors brought to market since its rollout, how does Sensor Excel stand up to competition today?Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor Excel. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Excel cartridges are noticeably smaller than, say, Mach 3 cartridges (about 1/3 smaller). The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than most razor systems today. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are very easy to shave as a result.The shave: 4.5 stars. One can tell that this truly was Gillette\'s workhorse model for quite some time, and that a lot of research & development went into the creation of this system. The Sensor Excel offers a comfortable shave with minimal drag, leaving the user feeling clean and smooth. As stated above, the blade angle and smaller cartridge design allows for easy precision shaving of sideburns and moustache/goatee areas--an ideal choice for men who maintain those types of facial hair. It is noteworthy that, as a person with sensitive skin, I felt no facial sensitivity after shaving with the Sensor Excel--something that I cannot say about newer razors such as Quattro and Fusion. For those with sensitive skin, this would perhaps be a wise choice.Durability: 2.5 stars. This was where Sensor Excel disappointed me. I get, at most, three shaves out of one cartridge. Drag and other issues resulting from dull blades arose quickly after two to three shaves. It\'s safe to say Sensor Excel has been surpassed by newer razors that have better blade coatings. By comparison, during my testing of the Gillette Fusion I got almost two weeks out of one cartridge. However, with the steep cost of blades for newer razors, Sensor Excel may still be a more affordable option.Overall: A fine razor offering a no-frills kind of approach to shaving. No advertising or fancy marketing to deal with when it comes to Sensor Excel--just a razor that does what it\'s supposed to do, well. Durability comes into question here as newer razors offer better blade coatings, but still a smart choice for those who don\'t buy into (and don\'t need) the uber-bladed razor trend.

I needed the travel bag, and it was only (...) for the bag and all the free stuff, so it was a no-brainer).What I like about this razor:1. It\'s pink.2. It\'s thin, girly and cute.3. It\'s comfortable to hold.4. It has the built-in shaving gel.Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 of those are all really superficial and don\'t amount to much.What I don\'t like about this razor:1. The very first thing I noticed about it is that there is a slimy, goopy gook that stretches (picture okra or chicken slime when you\'re cleaning it) as you shave. It is absolutely, positively gross and unsightly. Perhaps I\'m making too big a deal of that, but I have a weak stomach, and that really grossed me out.2. I wet my legs, turned the shower off, and sat down inside.  After I shaved my right leg, I immediately began shaving my left leg (I had some Nair on my bikini area, so I didn\'t have time to waste). While I was shaving my left leg, my right leg began to sting. After about two minutes, it became unbearable, so even though the time wasn\'t up on my Nair and I hadn\'t quite finished my left leg, I had to get under some running water.  THAT MADE IT WORSE!!! Both my legs began to burn! Discomfort is an understatement. I was in pain! I don\'t normally have sensitive skin, and this was the first time I\'ve ever had a shaving product to make me feel that way. It was absolutely unbearable.So bad that I actually had to write a review. I think in my entire life, I may have been compelled to write a review once or twice. That\'s how bad this experience was. So it\'s been about 15 minutes since I got out the shower. My legs aren\'t burning anymore, and they feel somewhat smooth. Not as smooth as my regular razor (Schick Intuition - which is nice and gives great results, but so bulky and big), but it\'ll do.

I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \'made for a woman, not a man.\'  This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.Like the standard (purple) VENUS BREEZE, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR (pale pink) comes with a holder which mounts directly to the wall of your shower or bath.  Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  The three blades are surrounded by gel bars.  There is no need to use shaving cream; just moisten the gel bars to get that silky, satiny feel.  The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme climate.To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  This will help any razor to give you a closer shaver.  While you are soaking, get the cartridge wet, so that the gel gets creamy.  You never want to shave with a dry razor anyway...ouch!  I usually just toss the razor in the tub for a minute or two.  Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  Just one less thing to worry about.The only negative about the VENUS BREEZE is that the gel bars do not last as long as the blades!  With care, the blades in each cartridge last up to a month.  (The triple blades shave my legs so close, that I really only need to shave them every other day.)  But the gel bars either run out or fall off in 2 - 3 weeks.  Then I go back to the shaving cream until the blades give out.Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  I have been satisfied with it for many years.  If Gillette could just make the gel bars last a bit longer...the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.",,,,

Otherwise, it\'s the same razor.For those who have not used a Venus razor:There are three main features of a Venus razor versus a standard multi-blade women\'s razor.The first is the soap/gel bars.  These bars basically provide the glide that you usually get from shave gel or foam.  You can definitely shave without lathering up.  That saves you time and cost.  However, the bars do mean that you have to press a little harder than you might be used to when the razor head is new to get a close shave.  (As the bars wear down from use, you don\'t have to press as hard.)  Until you get used to this, you may notice some unintended stubble.  Also, the bars make it a little tough to clean the razor.  I\'ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I\'m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  It\'d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  I really liked the scent on this one, and I\'m not normally a fan of shave gel scents.The second big feature of the Venus line is the easy-to-change razor head.  When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  Then, you open a sealed replacement head and click the handle into the slot.  It\'s a much safer and easier replacement process than razors I\'ve owned in the past.  Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it\'s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  Each razor head is individually packaged, so it\'s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  You don\'t have to worry about cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.The third feature is the hanging rack.  The Venus razor kit comes with a mounting rack for your shower.  The rack sticks to the shower wall using adhesive pads, and it holds 4 replacement blades (not included) and the razor with a blade attached.  I\'ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  Gillette didn\'t improve on this design for the Spa Breeze line.  I was hoping they\'d offer a suction-cup design.  Also, the design is such that you can\'t really use it unless you wall mount it.  The razor needs gravity to stay in place, and because the bottom of the rack is rounded, you can\'t just set it vertically on a shelf.  I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.As for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  I have very fine hair.  Many razors just aren\'t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I\'ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)All in all, the Venus line is excellent.  I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  I\'d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.",,,,

Also, the gel kind of goops, at first especially, and we found it kind of gooping off of she razor when not in use. I also found that while shaving arm pits, you need to apply some pressure to get the blades close to your skin - well, I don\'t like to do that when shaving there.

The new scent is pleasant & the color is pretty and girly.The problem with these (versus the other brand of 3-blade girl shavers) is that the strip of shaving gel disappears long before the blade wears out, but the extra surface area where the gel was is then irritating, so you can\'t really use it once the gel\'s gone, even though the blade is still perfectly good. The triple blades are usually very long lasting, but with the irritating little pads dragging along your shaving surface, the long-life blades become an unusable waste.

So it came as some surprise that this latest generation really did up the ante a bit from a performance standpoint.  Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven\'t so much as gotten a nick.  I\'ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  While I haven\'t attempted to use the razor without shaving cream, as the claims say you can (I have dry/sensitive skin that I feared would not react well), I will say that I think the skin of my legs gets less dry with this razor and I almost didn\'t need body lotion afterward.The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  The razor comes with a case that I believe is intended to adhere to the wall of your shower, with storage for razor blades, which come individually packaged.  I don\'t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can\'t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.The only downside - and one that isn\'t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.

I always found that women\'s razors worked better for this area because men\'s razors are meant for the face (I use the Gillette Fusion for this every other day activity) and have tried quite a bit since I started with this habit back in 2002/2003.  Like with the men\'s razors the products keep getting better with time and the Venus Spa Breeze is no exception.  With this latest incarnation the soap has been attached to the blades and a nice scent has been added as upgrades.  The old Venus blades always worked great but this upgrade is definitely a worthwhile one.  The pros are that the soap produced makes for a smoother shave and more clean and the smell really is nice.  The cons are that I would imagine these new blades are much more $$$ than the old Venus razors with regular cream and the soap attached doesn\'t allow you the same kind of control that you had before.If you like not having to lather up and don\'t mind spending the extra money this is a fine product.  If you want to save some cash and just use lather + the standard Venus product you can\'t go wrong there either.  Gillette makes the best razors around and I don\'t think they will be losing the shaving title any time soon.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,,,,
1587,1639,20090424,B001JQLNFA,4,"April 24, 2009",AGEKVD8JPZQMT,Silky Smooth,"Like all of the other versions of the Gillette Venus razors, this one leaves a smooth and silky feeling.  The package does, however, promote that because of the spa strips you don\'t need to use shaving cream.  Although you don\'t get a bad shave (IE razor burn, irritation,etc) without shaving cream, when using it with shaving cream, it leaves the skin a lot smoother and more moisturized.  Overall, if you already have a Venus system, this is not really a necessary upgrade, but if you\'re looking for a new shaving system, this one is great and will not disappoint.",,,,
1591,1643,20090423,B001JQLNFA,5,"April 23, 2009",A4UFU4WKYEUGO,A Lady\'s Razor,"Nicely packaged. The blades are in little plastic capsules that sit inside a plastic housing with a lid. This is a big switch from most ladies razors I have tried. Because the blades are sealed, they don\'t loose their moisturizing gel every time you turn on the shower. The casing comes with a little mounting bracket that is not hard to place or figure out. I have really bad eyesight, so fishing around for a razor without my glasses on can be entertaining.The razor and stem are ridiculously feminine. It really does go right past any attempt at simple functionality and well into something a 14 year old girl would throw a tantrum for. It\'s marvelous. The stem is a very elegant swirly pearl color with all these interesting rubber bits that make it easy to hold. It is easy to hold. I think you\'d really have to make an effort to drop it regardless of how soaped up you get. But you won\'t drop it because you will not want to.The blades are surrounded by these wide pink lip like things that look, to be quite honest, like something you\'d find in a adult movie used by the goddess of immaculate hairlessness. They are squishy and smell wonderful. They also work quite well if you get them damp so you can have a safe dry shave, or touch up.The Venus Breeze razor is really over the top but does function quite well. I tried it out on three day old leg stubble and was left with baby soft skin. I like it. It\'s a private, sweet smelling indulgence that works.",,,,

However, it may not be for all skin types.  The gel bars built into the cartridge should give most women an ultra convenient all-in-one shaving experience, but my skin ended up with very mild razor burn.  I started out as the package suggested, in the shower and wetting the razor, then when that burned as I stroked, I made sure that my legs were wet too.  Even that wasn\'t enough; hours later I can feel where each swathe of the razor went. I can also feel how nice and smooth my legs are. It gives a close shave. It\'s a lovely razor; I just need more lubricant.Four stars - it should work well for most users.  But beware if you have dry skin or like me have that thin, no-tan skin; you may need to add a little shaving cream.",,,,

Usually the other reviews merely validate my own opinion.  Rarely do I find myself disagreeing with the reviews significantly.

Many seem to complain about the strong smell.  I find it not too strong.  Maybe this is my nose not working but I find it pleasant.2.  Shirt friendly.  I have seen a few reviewers complain about the shirt staining.  I recommend you change detergent.  I have never had a problem with staining of shirts or even residue during the day.3.  Glides well for a non-gel stick.  I like the application of gels but this does a nice job and does not pull hair.Cons:1.

I switched to a safety razor for facial shaving more years ago than I care to remember and I have yet to find a disposable or replaceable or for that matter rechargeable (and I have tried quite a few) that comes anywhere close to equaling the resultant closeness of cut or smoothness particularly when those infuriating independent gray hairs that crop up under the chin are considered. However, I am not as adept in avoiding a sling blade result on the back of my head with a safety razor so I am constantly in the market to identify a disposable or replaceable that fills the bill.To that end, the ProGlide is acceptable but I still had to make several passes on the back of my head to get a smooth, minimally stubby result, not unlike the outcomes with a Mach 3 or Schick 3... or one of the five rechargeables currently residing in one bathroom or another. Interesting enough, I also got better results on my head with the back side trimmer single blade than the front side five blade shredder.

I put on some shaving cream and tried this bad boy out and it sent chills up my spine as I glided this thing across my sides and chin.  I even went against the grain and it was just so smooth.  Now for the ultimate test.... I grimaced as I anticipated pain as I was about to shave my mustache area and I couldn\'t believe how it just cut away at all my hairs.

I still feel the additional blades (over 3) does not contribute to the closer shave. It is a result of the tension strip that stretches your skin as you shave.

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.

Therefore, I need razors that can cut through it without excessive strokes that each take a bit of skin with them.The Mach 3 was a huge improvement over dual-blade razors for me, and for quite a while I stuck with those rather than paying a premium for the Fusion 5-blades.  Also affecting my decision was the old Onion article: \'**** Everything, We\'re Doing Five Blades,\' which reinforced my perception that a five-bladed razor was nothing but a marketing gimmick.And perhaps it is - but it shaves noticeably better than the Mach 3, either because of the additional blades or some other less-obvious improvements.  Not only do I get a better shave with fewer strokes, but I can even skip a couple days and then cut through the beginnings of a hoary beard with little effort.And even better, the new razors seem to last longer than the Mach 3s, giving half a dozen shaves or more before they need replacement.  The Mach 3s gave up the ghost after just 3 or so.I certainly recommend these razors if the cost is not a huge obstacle, especially if you\'ve got facial hair from hell like I do.",,,,

I was very impressed with it. However, two or three shaves later, the blades were no longer cutting well. It seems my facial hair was too much for ProGlide to handle. For all of the research and development that Gillette must have put into this product to justify its price (or maybe it was just hype and advertising that inflated the price), it looks like they got it wrong. I\'m having better luck with Schick Hydro 5, although Hydro 5\'s shave is very different from ProGlide\'s.

OK, that\'s a bit of exaggeration on my part, but to be perfectly honest, it actually is the best razor that I have ever used...hands down. I usually only shave once a week (to my family\'s dismay), so my stubble is quite long. I use to have to trim down my semi-beard with an electric razor and then shave, but now I use the ProGlide and it literally \'glides\' through my stubble for a nice clean shave. I also like how the stubble doesn\'t get caught in between the blades. I use to have to bang the razor against the side of the sink to get the captured stubble hairs to come out of the razor, but those days are now long gone.If anyone is reviewing replacement blades (as I am doing here), there should be no question as to the satisfaction of the product (proved by the continuing purchase of the product).",,,,

The problem is that the blades get too dull to use within a week.  Oh, I could still use them, but then I\'d be tugging at hair instead of cutting through the hair.  My Mach3\'s cartridges would last three months before hitting the waste basket.  And the vibrating mechanism doesn\'t do a lick of good, either.  I have had just as good of results when leaving the battery powered vibrator off.Now, if I could afford to spend $100 a year on razor cartridges, I would stick with the Pro Glide.

The little vibrating action of the battery powered handle really made a huge difference in how easy it was to shave, and the razor glided right through thick stubble with no problem at all.  The thinner blades didn\'t clog up and washed out pretty easy (which was a HUGE complaint about my older Fusion), and after using it for a few weeks, the blade is duller but not as nick happy as I thought it would be.So while the hype is still pretty big, I was surprised at how genuinely good this razor ended up being.The bad part?  Well, this thing is EXPENSIVE.  The handle is affordable, but you\'re paying $22 for 6 refills.  Thats unbelievable!  Especially since I can get 5 blades for a dollar with my safety razor.All in all, its a great razor, but its super expensive to buy cartridges.  If you can afford it, you\'ll like it.

I compared it to the Mach 3 and this is what I\'ve determined:PROS:1. Very close, smooth shave. It is noticably closer than the Mach 3.2. Less pulling than the Mach 3.3. Razor handle has a nicer and more expensive \'feel\' to it. It has a little heft, so to speak.CONCERNS / ISSUES:1. The razors are materially more expensive than the Mach 3. It\'s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money. If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I\'d go with this one.2. The razors are thinner. I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.3. Amazon has great info and instructions. The razor itself does not. It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box. For example, I really wasn\'t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head. I might have appreciated some of the features more if I had understood what they were for and that is not always obvious from the packaging.",,,,

I now use a simple old fashion safety razor which works great and the blades are dirty cheap.  Now I won\'t disagree that the Fusion cuts fine and I can shave in record time without fear of removing my Adam\'s apple but $4 a blade is just robbery.  For the most part I think I\'ll stick to safety razor for the bulk of my shaving and then finish up the \'scary\' areas with the Fusion.  This prolongs the life of the Fusion.  The safety razor actually works better if you let your whiskers grow longer as since it\'s single blade it never clogs.If you currently use the old Fusion then I fail to see any benefit in this new model.  I\'m sure they have some lovely marketing but in the end it\'s 98% the same and I couldn\'t tell the difference.  Perhaps the biggest fluff is the \'power\' feature.  It\'s completely useless and IMO is just an attempt to add another disposable item to this razor.  I\'m not sure who asked for their razor to shake in their hands but that\'s not what I want while I\'m shaving around my lips or throat.  I wound up keeping it off while I shave.  I\'m also still not a fan of the flip back behavior of the Fusion... I prefer the head to stay still but since this isn\'t new then maybe you\'re fine with it.Overall it\'s a fine razor, but it\'s a marketing (not engineering) upgrade with goals to charge you just a bit more per blade but it\'s already too much IMO.",,,,

2024,2096,20100610,B003987CL0,5,"June 10, 2010",A2H2I5FY1PUHP1,Five Stars From a Life Long Shick User,"To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.I\'ll begin by saying that I\'ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.ProGlide vs. Hydro 5Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.What\'s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette\'s as a travel holder with no problem.Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro\'s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as \'suspension\' for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.On initial \'hefting\' the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.The Shave TestAll of the above are secondary to the \'Yes, But How Does It Shave\' test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream and a badger bristle brush.Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \'razor burn\' marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \'dried\' she still said the Gillette side was smoother.Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.ProGlide vs QuattroShave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.So what\'s not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn\'t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.",,,,

The \'larger handle\' is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size. The shave was no closer, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide. Having said that, I can\'t complain, they sent it too me for free.It\'s an excellent marketing ploy designed to influence Americans to buy whatever product big businesses want us to buy next.

It did very well around the ankles, knees, behind the knees and under the arms it was nice and gentle.  I only had to do one pass over the bikini area which really cuts down on the rash, I appreciate that.  It was a nice clean, smooth shave.

For me it has changed the way I feel about shaving tenfold. The fusion was good but I still had issues with razor burn. The proglide changed all that. Usually I go about a day in between shaving. After buying the Proglide on Saturday and shaving that evening, I didn\'t shave till Tuesday night & that\'s cause I wanted to. I could have went a couple more days but I like a smooth head so I shaved. I couldn\'t believe how close a shave I got with this blade and went for days without any razor burn or irritation at all and that\'s going with the grain. I always liked going against the grain cause it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was, my head couldn\'t take the pain afterwards so I stuck with going with the grain. With the Proglide I\'m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road I\'ll give it a shot because just going with the grain I get a damn close shave. I know it won\'t be the case for some other people but for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years. Highly, HIGHLY recommend buying this prduct.",,,,

The color of the handle is different from the Fusion and it comes with a now ubiquitous blue light to indicate that it is working - just in case you happen to fall asleep during shaving. The blade separation looks different and the hair trimmer is certainly easier to cleaner than previous incarnations of the five blade format. But the shaving process felt no different and the results were certainly no different to my present Fusion electric razor. So I put a new blade in the Fusion and did - to the extent possible - a subjective side by side comparison of the Proglide and the Fusion. They seemed the same to me.We all know that the Gillette - now P & G - consumer model is on the blade replacement rather than the razor - but this version of the 5-blade seems to lack sufficient advancement in the technology to provide a better shave, The New Yorker columnist,  Adam Gopnik, actually wrote a nice piece on the razor wars that can be found as \'Reflections, \'The Fifth Blade,\' The New Yorker, May 11, 2009, p. 50 [...]The Proglide would fit right in with Mr. Gopnik\'s conclusions",,,,

The sensation wasn\'t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.  In my experience, though, it doesn\'t.  I don\'t feel I\'m getting a shave that is any better or closer than I get with my regular, non-power Fusion.  And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly.  So, this razor isn\'t really delivering a closer shave, it\'s taking me longer to shave, and I found the vibration to be annoying.  It\'s not something I intend to use.

I can shave in the shower without a mirror and the razor glides gently over my face without missing a spot or nicking my skin. If there is one downside to using Gillette Fusion razors it would be the high cost of replacement blades. I suppose one must pay the price for quality and inovation.The new Fusion has a feature that my previous one didn\'t.  The on/off switch is lighted.

When I want a really close shave and don\'t have a lot of time to spend shaving, I opt for the Fusion.  It requires less preparation time for my beard and I don\'t have to be nearly as careful while shaving.  Also, typically one pass does the job with the Fusion.As for the new model, the Proglide, there are improvements.  They\'ve created better spacing between the blades to help keep the razor from clogging.  I think this also improves drying, which should lengthen the life of the blades.  I don\'t care how much, or what kind of coating they put on the blades, they will eventually rust.  It seems also that the trim blade is improved.  It\'s very handy for getting the tight spots, like right under your nose.  That\'s a problem area with a safety razor and certainly with a Mach 3.  All in all, this is a great razor and one that I would use every day if the replacement blades weren\'t so expensive.

It\'s sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.  I\'ll say this, it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  When I\'ve waited a few days before using, the Proglide is a dream.  It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  Sadly, I\'ve noticed that if I shave two days in a row my skin gets irritated and the shave is nowhere near as close.  I know that some consider the battery operated vibration to be a mere gimmick, but having used a razor with the same capability for years I have found that my shave is always closer WITH the vibration, and I\'m quick to replace the battery because of that.  Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it\'s worth it (as far as I\'m concerned).

The gaudy styling...this is no Apple product! The battery...uh, what? Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...But, I needed a razor and the introductory price for the razor and blade is cheap and so I one-clicked it.Only had a day\'s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby and I didn\'t have to go over areas twice. Even glided smoothy and efficiently over the adams apple area. Battery on one side, unpowered on the other. Didn\'t notice a difference.Not a hard test, not enough for a review either, so I didn\'t shave for 4 or 5 days and tried it again. Non-powered on the right side, it was a dramatic improvement over previous multi-bladed shavers. Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better. Just a hair easier. It does help with a thick growth, not a noticeable difference to me with an overnight\'s worth. Of course, this will be different for everyone.Is the motor worth it? Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here. Would two or three blades work just as well? Not likely the cost would be much less, so what the heck, the more blades the better. Play with those blades. They really are very different than anything I have seen before.I really don\'t think I can get a better shave. A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly. I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don\'t take much time doing it. The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it. It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.The little trimmer blade works well.This is a highly recommended product, one that actually may make some difference in your life if shaving has been difficult for you.

But for most guys, it simply doesn\'t deliver the closeness the \'old-fashioned\' 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:1) They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  But in the current Proglide commercial, the cartoon is altered to show the second blade doing nothing except scraping the skin, with the hair ending up sticking out above the skin surface.  Major BS here by Gillette.2) If you\'re not comatose, you\'ll notice on their \'Take the Proglide Challenge\' commercials (the one with the used-car salesman guy), they are actually comparing Proglide vs. a DISPOSABLE RAZOR!!!  What does that prove?  How low can Gillette go???Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn\'t totally worthless.  They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  Bottom line is, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  After 2 shaves, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that\'s less close AND less smooth.",,,,

I bought it on amazon and used it in NJ. Here is my take on this Razor:1. The handle grip is awesome, very confortable.2. The blades, where are they ? does it have blades? Which means i dont feel like there is a blade, they are so thin, its really glides on my face.3. Vibrations, they are soooo soothing, i think i would recommend a buy not without it, it doubles the gliding pleasure. Dont buy the manual one (my very personal opinion, you can if you want :-) )4. The shave is so close, even if you shave against the grain, it works like WOWWWW.5. My skin is little extra sensitive, so i do get razor bumps near my throat, but i dont think thats because of the razor, i get in all Razors or electronic shavers (i have Norelco Speed XL).6. I use it with art of shaving kit. Its the best partner.7. I also feel those who shave there pubic areas, this blade will be a extra plus because of extra thin blades and very little space between each blade, less chances of cuts.

Despite their abundantly mass-produced stock, they have been well-built (some more than others) and have stood the test of time.  These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I\'m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  While Gillette\'s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  Where I know some bumps on my cheeks and chin should be, the vibration may confuse me and cause me to improperly shave and leave some spots thicker than others.The blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I\'m considering doing the ol\'-fashioned wet shaving.All in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.",,,,

Cuts my skin, not a close shave, requires too much pressure to bring blades in contact with skin.","I recently discovered Gillette\'s Venus line of razors (I know, they\'ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite). Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \'what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel so I don\'t have to lather up my skin?\'. Apparently, something other than these Venus Spa refills with the shave gel built in.I don\'t know; maybe I just got a bad batch of razor cartridges, but the one that I opened up doesn\'t really release any shave gel until I\'ve moved well beyond a leg or forearm or two. When it DOES release that gel, it\'s more as a concentrated, thin \'string\' of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair. Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger\'s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor\'s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \'lips\' to get the \'teeth\' to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it\'s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades. Just not well executed.I\'d read all of the reviews for the single packs of Venus Spa cartridges, so I knew that there\'d be a 50/50 shot that I\'d actually like these, but putting them into use for myself solidified it for me. You shouldn\'t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that\'s what I feel like I need to get these to work right. As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I\'ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges. At this rate, I\'d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much. THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference. THESE razor cartridges? Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o\'clock shadow every day, and I didn\'t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble!

I do think that they proglide may be sharper and give a better shave for the first 1-3 shaves but then they seem the same.  I also think the proglide did not last quite as long but can\'t be sure.  I usually got 2 weeks from the regular but only got about 10 days with the proglide.  Reason I can\'t be sure is I skipped shaving and it had to deal with a 2 day growth twice and that may have \'shortened\' the use.  I just wish I could find a razor that was more economical.  I had gone electric but suffered from irritation and when you figure the purchase plus the 2x a year blade replacement (yes electrics need blade replacement too) the cost came out the same.  When the 5 blade razor first appeared a news story did a comparision with the 3 blade.  There was no noticeable difference in the quality of shave that the review panel could feel.  I may go back to the Mach 3 or try a Schick product.  I have always used Gillette razors.  I would give a 4 for quality but knock it down to a 3 because of cost.,,,,

I found these rarely give the nicks and cuts other razors have, but there are some drawbacks that go along with it.  They are VERY expensive.  No matter where you look (Amazon, CVS, etc..), they\'re just pricey.  I wouldn\'t mind it so much except for the fact that one razor doesn\'t last very long.  One razor gives me about 6-7 shaves before it starts scratching and cutting me.  I don\'t know but I just feel they should last longer at this price.  It kind of reminds of \'the printer ink price scam\'.  You know, like when HP sells a great printer for $75 but charges $20 for a single ink cartridge.

I have used Gillette products since I first started shaving, way back in the winter of \'97-98.  At that time I was borrowing my dad\'s Mach III to shave my sparse mustache (lip hair).  Since then I graduated to the Mach III, Mach III Turbo, Mach III Turbo Power, and finally the Fusion Power.  These blades last me (again at 2 per week) for about 1.5 months before they are noticeable duller.  Thus, this is good value (I paid $19 for the 6 pack last time I ordered.).

But, even though I have no financial reasons constraining my purchase of this example of our \'finest\' technology, I think there could be some misplaced priorities in a society that would spend almost $4 for a razor blade for their razor that vibrates while shaving via a little battery propelled motor.  Do we really need this product to satify our need to look so nice, or could we feed a few more people with the same amount?  Or do we buy it simply because it is the best?  Or, perhaps we need to by this product to assure Gillette makes a fat margin after they pay their marketing people who make up an eight word name for this product (if we count the hyphenated word as two)?  I think men should stop shaving until Gillette finds a way to sell these things for less than $2.  The world would not end if we let our beards grow and reduce their sales to next to nothing.  The worst that would probably happen is they would be forced to sell their company at a huge discount from its current value to a buyer who would pay so little for the company that the blades could be sold for an amount significantly less than $2.  Could we even survuve in a world that no longer produces $4 razor blades?  I bought these blades because they are the best available, but I really do not need the best available.  They really do not do anything of value for me.  I just think it is incredible that we have been sold on the idea that we need a smooth shave.  Now we have guys who shave their heads so they will not reveal their natural loss of hair.  And some guys are shaving their bodies because they think their hair is in the wrong place or their girlfriend or boyfriend do not like hair in the \'wrong\' place.  I think our thoughts are in the wrong place.  I believe we all have the right to appear the way we wish.  But I also have the right to chuckle at my self and others who think $4 razor blades are great stuff.  I rated this product with five stars because it works well, but I reduced it to three stars because it is so unnecessary.  While this is an unnecessary product, it has no real objectionable purpose other than its reflection of how we squander our assets at time when we criticize our government for its outrageous spending choices that are driving our country to financial failure.  In conclusion, do we have the moral authority to demand a like reduction in our wasteful government spending while we continue to buy $4 razor blades.  The answer must only be \'Yes\'.  Our government should not have any control of private spending, but the electorate must have total control of government spending via the House of Representatives even with items of insignificant amounts.  Even though this example is related to razor blades which seem insignificant, our government\'s thinking in this regard is they should be spending as little as possible to accomplish a specific purpose and then only when they have determined that the purpose is one that is worthwhile and necessary.

I got mine as a Christmas Present 2 years ago.  It took me just over 4 months to use the three cartridges that came with it.  There is no downside.  It was both the best shave, as well as the most economical one I had ever experienced.  I admit that I was a little taken back by the cost when I finally ventured out in the spring to buy some replacements.  Around here they either lock them away in some little Fort Knox in the store, or even enclose them in security boxes that sound an alarm if you try to open it or run out the door.  I can only imagine that too many men, (and some women too) have considered larceny over cheaper blades if they can\'t afford the fusions.  The fusion cartridges may be a little steep, but the truth is 8 of them in a pack can easily get your average Joe through an entire year of shaving. Here on Amazon, I got 8 refills for $20 and free shipping!  That\'s not only a good $5.00 cheaper than the best place here, but that\'s not including the savings on the sales tax.  Believe me when I tell you that I spent over an hour one night searching for replacement blades online and finally settled on Amazon as unbeatable.  Nobody even came close with the free shipping.  If you\'re not already a Gillette fusion shaver, become one.  If you are, buy the cartridges here.  Amazon not only has the best price for them but it is actually easier and more convenient to buy here.  You will never be tempted to resort to larceny....",,,,

I have to say that I am thankful I didn\'t pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I\'ve ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for \'precision\' is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can\'t be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o\'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What\'s next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle?

First off, the single blade is absolutely useless, it cuts nothing, it\'s just a gimmick. This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90% of the replacement blades, I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop (presumably glue) all over the blade, with the single blade missing! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems, as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet, and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality. I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke, but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades, I think it\'s time to call a spade a spade. I shave my head and my face both, and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors, and even with a fresh blade, many times it feels as though I\'m shaving my face/head with a sharp rock. needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase.",,,,
2516,2596,20060521,B004B8AZH0,1,"May 21, 2006",A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,A big step backwards... don\'t be fooled.,"I began using Gillette\'s Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.",,,,

I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Also, before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.",,,,

Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense. I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline: we are being milked of every cent we are willing to part with.Another issue I\'m concerned about is that the clamshell packaging is dangerous if it is anything like the packaging used for Mach 3 cartridges. The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you. It is unsafe for most adults. The government ought to force Gillette to design safer packaging.The main reason for giving this product 1 star is the price. I\'m not willing to part with $22 to $28 for 8 shaving cartridges.",,,,

This new holder is MUCH smaller and suctions to the wall. You just slide the neck of the razor into the holder, and that\'s it. I\'m not sure why they changed this. I would think wall space in the shower isn\'t really something most people are trying save, and now, your spare razor heads have to be kept outside of the shower.

The moisture gel feels slimy, and while that might switch to smooth after you rinse it away, it\'s not a lather and not at all pleasant while using it.

There were about two shaves worth of this in the sample I received. I used one and immediately threw the rest in the trash.It was like trying to shave with Crisco. It was very oily and hard to wash off my hands. It did the worst job of softening my beard of ANY shaving cream or gel I\'ve ever used, then after the shave, was equally difficult to completely wash the residue off my face.The (brand new) razor blade was left with this stuff gunked up between the blades as if I had run it through a can of solid Crisco shortening. I don\'t know how much hot water (VERY hot) I had to use before it finally all washed out of the blades, but it was far too much.The shave itself was similar to when I\'ve been caught on a trip without shaving cream and used bath soap to lather with, in that it makes it possible, but not comfortable. I\'d rather use bath soap to shave with than this stuff, and I\'m not exaggerating in making that statement.I have used Edge shaving gel for years. In contrast to this product, Edge does not leave an oily residue on my hands, does soften my beard (and my beard is a bit on the tough side), does not need intense scrubbing to remove from my face, and does not imbed itself into the razor blades. With Edge and a new blade, I never have any \'pull\' on a shave. My first, last, and only shave with this mess was an irritating pull on every shaving stroke (yes, with a brand new first time ever used blade).I\'m a big fan of the Fusion razors, but whoever invented this junk, and anyone else in the company that green-lighted it for sale, should be horse whipped.",,,,

I wish the trimmer length was adjustable (though since i usually go shortest length, it\'s fine - I never seem to remove the guide for the shortest beard length), and wish the razor wasn\'t a snap on snap off piece (same for the trimmers).  I don\'t seem to use the razor blade - I use my separate Fusion razor for shaving.  In the end, I have a really good $20 trimmer, which isn\'t a bad thing.",,,,

2725,2810,20120225,B0062IWQVU,2,"February 25, 2012",A2LPB4WCIMVPOI,Not what I expected,I bought this to replace an old Wahl beard and mustache trimmer. It took me about 4 times as long to get the same end result from my old trimmer.  Not only did it cover less area at a time but it felt slower (maybe because it was battery powered?) and I had to go over it all a couple of times.  I really expected more from this after seeing the commercials. Unfortunately it didn\'t measure up to what I expected from a company like Gillette.,,,,

2738,2823,20120211,B0062IWQVU,5,"February 11, 2012",A34AJOQX9NGT7G,My Quick Take,There\'s a reason my local big box store can\'t keep these in stock. Buy on Amazon and save a few bucks. At this price you can\'t find a better quality trimmer let alone a razor as well. No cheapo plastic. It has a little weight to it and the rubberized grip feels great in your hand. The snap on combs aren\'t made of brittle plastic and have a bit of flex. The base that holds it all is well designed to actually hold everything securely. The trimmer works well and didn\'t pull any hairs on my beard and the fusion razor is well... a fusion razor. We\'ll see how it stands the test of time. Finally a trimmer that won\'t sit on the shelf. Well worth the price.,,,,
