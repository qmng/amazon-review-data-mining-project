The refills that came with it lasted similarly long.Then I bought refills, and each blade was dull within a week and a half.About two years ago, I found a place on the Web that sold cryonically-treated razor cartridges (you can Google for \'cryogenically tempered Mach 3 razor\').  They were slightly more expensive than most Web retailers, but they last at least three times as long...

When new, they give a very nice clean, smooth, and even shave on your face.After that, it\'s a MAJOR pain to clean out the whiskers that get caught between the triple blades.  I had to spend 10 minutes shaking the razor in both standing and running water to clean it out.  Now when you\'re up in the morning trying to get ready for work, you don\'t have that kind of time to spare cleaning a razor.Problem is, if you don\'t clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.Also, even after cleaning, it doesn\'t last very long at all.  On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &quot;indicator strip&quot; sooner.I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

31,32,20110818,B000052YHS,5,"August 18, 2011",A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,"Fast, effective, stupid-proof","The reason to buy this razor is so you won\'t have to think about shaving. There\'s no special technique, it\'s easy to clean, and it\'s disinclined to cut you. It doesn\'t feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I\'m using the same handle, and I\'ve since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can\'t feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don\'t reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won\'t fare as well. I\'ve bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.I\'ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it\'s difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it\'s been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge. Nitpicking, really.A safety razor would probably give you a closer cut, but if shaving is something you dispense with rather than an event to relish, the Mach 3 is where it\'s at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,50,20080313,B000052YHS,2,"March 13, 2008",A2QMXIFIVE4LNS,The best expensive mediocre shave a man can get.,"Mediocre and Overpriced, March 13, 2008By  supernatural (Illinois) - See all my reviewsUnfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems. It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,52,20070115,B000052YHS,5,"January 15, 2007",A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,The Best I Have Ever Used,"I have used disposal razors (great when you have the facial hair of a teenager), electric razors (pretty good for a while, but the replacement blades are expensive), and several generations of Gillette razors.  The Mach3 is the best yet, though I have yet to try the new Fusion razor.Gillette makes all sorts of claims regarding the Mach3.  I am unable to tell whether any of the claims have merit.  I can tell you that the blades, though expensive, last a long time for me.  I have moderately tough facial hair.  The old disposable razors gave me a few days of shaving and they were history.  I have shaved up to two months with these razors and still got a good shave.I have read that there are controversies about the value of three blades.  I think the three blades help keep the razor at the optimum angle on my face for shaving.  I do get a pretty good shave as well.  I do use Edge Advanced Shave Gel in combination with my Gillette Mach3, which may help get me a better shave.Most men in the United States shave, whether we like it or not.  The Gillette Mach3 gives me the best and most consistent shave I have ever had.  Until I find a better razor, the Mach3 is the one for me.Enjoy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gillette\'s is good at all that. I don\'t have sensitive skin, but I\'ve always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.Everything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream.

Yeah, I remember. What a sensation! What a shave! What a waste of money. The expensive Mach 3 line has practically surpassed every razor out there in quality shaving and design. But it will never surpass the meaning of the word \'deal\'. And now, just a couple of years back, we were introduced to the Mach 3 TURBO, the special edition of a Mach 3 razor. Hmmm, silver all the way through. Shiny! Very dashing. Wow.....shaves well too, now that the three blades are coated to reduce friction. That\'s a relief! The razor has an evil price tag of about $11 canadian, and the razor cartridges go for about $10 for 4, or $19 for 8. I guess the Gillette head honchos needed a new fleet of \'Porsche Boxter\' convertibles and a few yachts. Well, if they get us to spend the money on their stuff, then we\'ll make them look richer than real estate dumbbell Tom Vu and Sly Stallone put together. I love a good, comfortable, gash free shave. And the Mach 3 is a terrific razor to get this wonderful shave I look forward to every morning. Mind you, the Mach 3 Turbo is just....well, too good of a razor. Kind of like an oversensitive Ferrari sport steering system. It\'ll get to every corner and turn...with scary precision. So, anti-friction coating or not, it\'s a serious blade. Yesterday, I went and bought the less expensive Schick Extreme 3, and even with it\'s three blades, it gives me a shave nearly as close as the Mach 3. Okay, so that\'s an A- shave, and not an A+. Still, the \'Extreme\' is a terrific razor, cuts the hairs well without leaving me the feeling that I have to be \'so\' careful with it, and is a much more reasonable price for both the razor and blade cartridges than the mighty Mach 3. Sigh. What\'s this world coming to? All this wasted money spent to find a razor that\'s a good price and gives you a great shave. Yeah....guess you could say that recently, I went to extremes.

217,225,20090316,B0001LQGEM,3,"March 16, 2009",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,Average performance,"After using this razor for a short period of time, I feel compelled to tell others how it stacks up in the world of razors. With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one. The cartridges are still available in some stores, however. This review specifically covers the Sensor3 cartridge system.Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor3. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Sensor3 cartridges are noticeably smaller than the Mach 3 cartridges, by comparison. The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.The shave: 3 stars. I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving. I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days\' facial hair growth. The angle of the blade takes some getting used to. I noticed several times that I placed the blade on my face at the wrong angle, presumably because of my adjustment to the Mach 3/Fusion/Quattro razors which seem to have a more linear handle design. The biggest problem I encountered were several cuts. Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors. I do note that the shave was close, but comfort was lacking.Durability: 3 stars. This is the durability rating I give to the Sensor3 disposables. I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges. Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.Overall: The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable). For razor systems, one would be advised to choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

236,245,20050609,B0001LQGEM,5,"June 9, 2005",A2ERK85P6X5I6S,FINALLY! Something that works on my face!,"I have the worst possible combination for shaving: a thick beard and sensitive skin. Ingrown hairs and razor bumps were a weekly, if not daily occurance for me. I started off as a teenager with the original Sensor. When that got too painful I transitioned to the Sensor Excel. That served me well through my college years, where I could get away with shaving every 2 or 3 days. I found that my face needed a day or 2 off before I could shave comfortably again. When I entered the workforce, the president of my company noticed the stubble on my face during my \'off\' days and insisted that I shave every day. Well, after about a week of daily use with the Excel, my neck was about as raw and sore as it ever had been. That was about the time that Gillette introduced the Mach3. I transitioned to that, and eventually the Mach3 Turbo, but I was STILL getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps.I did some research and found that my technique (shaving against \'the grain\' without shaving with the grain first) was causing a great deal of my problems, so I started to change my ways with less than stellar results. The Mach3 was designed to be used \'against the grain\', and shaving in the direction of my hair growth produced almost no results at all. I couldn\'t even feel the razor cutting anything as I pulled it down along my face and neck. In addition, the added width of the blades made it nearly impossible to shave the areas underneath my nostrils. I had to keep my old Sensor handy to tackle that area when I was done with the rest of my face. My fiancee suggested spending $20 on the new battery-powered Mach3...no, thank you!Then I saw the Senor3, and decided to give it a try. The blades were cheaper than the Mach3 (even at Costco Warehouse prices), so it wasn\'t much of an investment for the experiment. All I have to say is, \'THANK GOODNESS!\' The Sensor3 has the best of both worlds between the Excel and the Mach3. The blades fit any Sensor handle, which is a more traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn\'t have to invest in a whole new system. It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it\'s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors AND I can get to the area under my nose. But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results. To the outside world I look clean-shaven every day, even though I can feel a tiny bit of stubble. That\'s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.I now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I\'m as smooth as a baby\'s backside. I\'ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort. The \'Art of Shaving\' products are a godsend. Invest in the Pre-Shave oil, trust me. I also went \'retro\' and picked up their shaving cream and brush. Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it\'s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route.

I will cut myself into a million pieces with the cheap disposable blades, and even previous versions of the mach 3 blade still left my skin irritated.  Now that the m3 power has come out, the shave is so much less irritating and, when combined with m3 power shave gel, it performs even better! The green lubrication strip is amazing! The blades just glide right over the skin with the new addition, however I typically find that the lubrication only lasts me 2 shaves, and then it starts to nick up my skin. The blades break down to about $1.00 a piece, which turns out to be $0.50 per shave for me (for the blade product alone, not incuding shave cream, new batteries, etc.), which is a bit high. The blade is great but the price is a lot. If you are willing to spend the extra money for a great shave, I have not found a better razor.UPDATED: The Gillette Fusion Power blades are even better than this product. At the time when I wrote this review, Fusion had not even been released. After using Fusion Power, I cannot return to this product any longer. Fusion provides an even LESS irritating shave to my skin that the M3 Power did, and seems to trim quicker and slide smoothly across my face with the proper shaving cream.

If you have problems with your razors leaving your face feeling raw, you can do all sorts of stuff (better shaving cream, soaking your face in hot water, etc.), but at the end of the day, it all comes down to your razor.

The first couple days using the Fusion were okay, but I immeadiately noticed I couldn\'t get as close a shave as with the Mach3. A lot of this is that the Fusion has a large surface area, so it\'s hard to do a lot of detail work, sort of like painting with a roller brush. The single blade on the back is supposed to compensate for this, but except for doing a mediocre job of cleaning up strays under my nose, the single blade was useless. The first Fusion cartridge gave up on me after about a week and left my face barely looked different before and after the shave. Even after replacing the cartridge, my face seemed to get used to the Fusion quickly and stubbornly refused to give me a good looking shave, no matter how many times I scraped those Fusion blades over my mug. I also found myself working harder to get the shaving gel and water off the Fusion between strokes, which is annoying.I should say that my face is a little weird in that the hairs grow very slowly but are very tough. I used to shave against the grain (up the face) for this reason but found I could get away with shaving with the grain using a Mach3 regularly. So, for people with softer facial hair, the story might be different.The one advantage I\'d give the Fusion is that it does tend to work best when you only use one stroke down an area, so for people who get easily irritated by multiple blade strokes over the same area, this could help.I switched back to a Mach3 blade this morning though, and couldn\'t be happier. I have a lot more control over the shave, it\'s cheaper to buy the cartridges, and in general it\'s just a better experience. It will be a sad day when/if Gillette drops their Mach3 line, probably in favor of some 9-bladed shaving monstrosity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had been using the Mach 3 and Gillette 3 blade disposible (along with Edge Ultra-sensitive gel), but noticed more and more razor bumps. It got so bad, that I had to take the day off from work because I couldn\'t show my totally raw/cut/irritated face.  Needless to say, my skin is sensitive.Well, I didn\'t shave for 2 days trying to baby my skin so it would recover.  The next day, I had to shave so I had to make a decisionAs with most cases, when I need something answered, or need other people\'s opinions, I fired up the good ol\' web browser.  I started by researching electric razors since I heard they were easier on your face, but after reading the reviews, I couldn\'t see spending $150 for something that may not even help and probably wouldn\'t give me as close a shave.I had heard of the Fusion and it did sound interesting to me.  The 5 blade feature didn\'t impress me as much as the fact that the blades are closer together.  I figured if they\'re closer it wouldn\'t give my skin the chance to get between them and be sliced off - excuse my graphic language :) I looked up reviews on the Fusion and found some mention of it being good for sensitive skin.  That did it for me, so off I went to buy a Fusion.When I got to the store, their were rows and rows of empty racks (I would guess at least 20 rows) where all the Fusions had been.  Seems like they\'re very popular with the local crowd.  Anyhow there was ONE left and I nabbed it.Got it home and immediately went in to shave.What a difference!  No razor new razor bumps, and it didn\'t even irritate the old ones (from my Gillette disposables).  No cuts, no irritation whatsoever!  And it really gives you a smooth shave.  Even my wife was impressed with my smooth face!So, moral to this story.  If you have sensitive skin, and you want a really close shave with no irritation, get the Fusion.

Ironically, the Fusion is particularly bad at the two things it is advertised as being particularly good at: close, comfortable shaving, and shaving hard-to-reach places.The blades are terrible.  Right out of the box, the blades caught on my beard and made it painful to shave.  It felt as if the razor was very dull.  I switched blades after two shaves and the replacement was just as bad.  Comparitively, the Mach 3 blades feel great for as many as 10 uses for me.  Not comfortable at all, and because of the pain, I couldn\'t shave as close.As for using this razor to shave hard to reach areas, they must be kidding!  Compare the size of the Mach 3 with the Fusion.  If the Mach 3 is a tight-cornering sports car, the Fusion is a school bus.  To accomodate the five blades the razor pad is so large it\'s difficult to share accurately. And the \'trim\' blade on the back is simply dangerous - the placement makes it much more likely to cut your fiinger, but the plastic on either end of the blade itself makes it unlikely to shave your beard.Not worth the money.

Shaving\'s about as pleasurable as a molten lava enema.  Fortunately, the right products can make it a little more bearable.  I\'ve never anticipated the release of a shaving product of any kind before, but this razor got me really intrigued.  Could this be the razor that conquers my impossible face (and wallet) once and for all?Gillette have been the masters of shaving comfort for several years now.  Their introduction of the Mach 3 razor was a breakthrough, just like they said.  A lot of you likely still use the Mach 3, but it\'s a good bet the Fusion will make you want to upgrade.I\'ll admit, I was a little wary about using a five-bladed razor.  I felt the same way about the Mach 3; I envisioned pressing too hard and slicing into my jugular, or worse, going to work with an entire roll of toilet paper on my face.  Thankfully, the opposite happened, and I used the Mach 3 and M3 Turbo for years.  I even bought into the M3 Power when it came out, but found there wasn\'t much difference in closeness or comfort (which is why I chose the manual Fusion over the Fusion Power).  Still a really good shave, though.Anyway, about the Fusion.  First off, don\'t be intimidated by the five blades.  They\'re close enough together that you really have to try to cut yourself.  In fact, that\'s one of the beauties of this razor.  Even a face like mine, which is very susceptible to cuts, accepted the Fusion\'s blades with very little irritation.  The first couple of times I used it, I had to watch out for pressing too hard and suffered a couple minor nicks, but I quickly got the hang of it.  The blades really do all the work.  The head of the razor is bigger than the M3 as well, which actually does cut down on shaving time.I\'ve always liked the \'indicator\' strip on the top of the M3 blade that lets me know when it\'s time to change the blade, and it\'s here on the Fusion as well.  It\'s made with aloe, if you\'re interested in that sort of thing, which supposedly aids in shaving comfort.  You\'ll get about a week\'s worth of good shaves before the blade wears out, which works out to a pack of cartridges a month (about the same as the M3).  It\'s best to pick these up in bulk (packs of 8); if and when you switch to this razor, you\'ll need them anyway, and you\'ll save a little dough in the process.The extra blade on the back of the razor is rather neat indeed.  It does help even out your sideburns and touches up those tricky spots right under your nose and above your chin.  I wouldn\'t use it for beard sculpting or anything, but for tough areas it does a good job.  Just be mindful of that blade when you\'re shaving near your ears.  I accidentally nicked my earlobe shaving my jawline the first time I used it. Yeowch!Changing the blade out is just as easy as the M3 also.  Just pop, slide, and click a new blade in.The \'comfort guard\' under the main blades is a slight improvement from the M3, but it\'s not really a \'wow\' factor.  The \'ergonomic\' handle is pure gimmick; it does little more than make the Fusion look like a phaser from Star Trek.  I would rather just buy the blades and have them fit on my Mach 3, but what kind of marketing savvy would that be?  Oh well; the razor itself isn\'t exactly a bank-breaker, and you only have to buy it once.All told, this is the Porsche 911 of razors.  It\'s a smooth ride, it\'s comfortable, it\'s fast, and yes, even though the blades are pricey, it\'s worth it to me.  If I had my druthers, of course, I\'d use an electric (they\'re much less expensive in the long run), but they\'re just not compatible with my face and Rocky Mountain-ish peaks and valleys of my neck.  (Believe me; I\'ve tried five different kinds.)  The Fusion\'s the closest shave I\'ve gotten with a blade yet.  If you really saw the difference between the M3 and M3 Power on your face, you\'ll probably notice it with the Fusion Power as well, but I figure I\'m paying enough for the one without the motor.I\'m glad I made the switch, and after comparing with the Mach 3, I won\'t go back.

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

503,513,20101219,B000BUUVTE,3,"December 19, 2010",A3NQU1649SH0Q4,Caveat emptor,"The lengthy product literature above (apparently from Gilette) is misleading for this model.  It touts the advantages of the Fusion Proglide razor, and the vibrating Fusion.  Both of those razors cost more.  I\'m not sure why anyone would want to talk a customer out of the exact product at hand (Fusion Manual); surely they didn\'t intend any \'bait and switch\' but it sure was careless -- and relatively uninformative.BTW I do indeed own a Gilette (Manual) Fusion razor and have used it.  I wasn\'t all that impressed, and I don\'t find it significantly better than the old Mach 3.  For the money (and cheaper blades in the long run) I prefer the Schick Quattro Titanium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
506,516,20100813,B000BUUVTE,2,"August 13, 2010",A30XFWBO69F4CO,more blades more money,"Based on all the hype I decided to give this a try.  I have very sensitive skin with a tough beard that sems not to grow in any particular grain.  OK, so it has 5 blades; truth is it doesn\'t shave any better than the model with 3 but the blades are hideously expensive.  I also have the 3 blade power model which is another bad joke unto itself.  I still have to go over and over the same area, shave from different angles over the same space and it takes just as long and gives no better shave.  True it was a nice touch to add the precision trimmer blade to the top side but I\'m not sure that justifies the cost either. I will probably use the 2 blades that came with it and then put it in the goodwill bag. Oh yes, by the way,  it is very pretty, if that makes a difference when you are shaving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
507,517,20100714,B000BUUVTE,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

516,526,20091012,B000BUUVTE,5,"October 12, 2009",A3OYO3Z2CHIHFS,Pinnacle of Manual Shaving,What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It\'s now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it\'s thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can\'t be improved.  It\'s just that good.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

When I started using Mach3, I thought this was the best shaving experience I'd ever get. And then Fusion proved me how wrong I was. Shaving becomes just too damn easy and smooth with Fusion - GO FOR IT!!!

      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

When I started using Mach3, I thought this was the best shaving experience I'd ever get. And then Fusion proved me how wrong I was. Shaving becomes just too damn easy and smooth with Fusion - GO FOR IT!!!

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

	1	""April 9, 2010",AAX9J3ILB1XNT,A giant step backward!,"I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn\'t waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3\'s were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I\'ve had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an \'upgrade\' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you\'re handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, \'What were they thinking?!\' crosses my mind.  I\'ve discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

When I started using Mach3, I thought this was the best shaving experience I'd ever get. And then Fusion proved me how wrong I was. Shaving becomes just too damn easy and smooth with Fusion - GO FOR IT!!!

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

Then along came the Fusion (5 blades). And honestly, the shave from this one is better. I never thought that possible. You can hardly feel the blades just glide across your face. I for one will continue using the Fusion. Even though I don\'t like paying double for the blades. The shave is well worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He said it is a very smooth, close cut.  And he really liked the \'flip side\' sideburn trimmer.  We also bought the Fusion shaving lotion and balm, which he would recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1649,549,20071211,B000BUUVTE,1,"December 11, 2007",A39YXLLUFTSSP4,The worst I have ever used,"This is an upgrade? This razor is terrible. I usually let my facial hair go for a few days and then shave. The system worked great with the Mach 3 but I decided to ...upgrade. Big mistake, this thing is like shaving with a dull saw. Back to the Mach 3 for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1650,550,20071210,B000BUUVTE,4,"December 10, 2007",A3LMEZZJ7ZGAMB,"Razor Bumps, Ingrown Hairs, Do You Hate Shaving?  Not Anymore","For as long as I can remember, shaving has been a dreaded event. I always got razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and my facial hair isn\'t even curly. I have tried everything from electric razors, to clippers, to double edge safety razors, and even changing the directions that I shaved. Nothing has ever really worked.  I received a free fusion in the mail, and was skeptical. I tried it, but I still got razor bumps. But then I thought for a second about shaving WITH the grain and NOT stretching the skin, and thought even more about using a shaving brush that I had purchased. I also decided to use a simple, cheap shaving cream, Barbasol Aloe Shaving Cream that I already had in my closet. I found the SOLUTION!  But I should also mention that I shave in the shower with a mirror. I now look forward to shaving, and I feel that shaving everyday is best because it allows your face to grow accustomed to shaving, also allowing the hairs on your face to grow in the direction that you shave, remember-WITH the grain. If you shave with the grain you greatly reduce your chances of having ingrown hairs. If you want to love shaving, and be like that guy who has a perfect shave, get yourself a gilette fusion, a shaving brush, a shower mirror, and a mug. Shave in the shower:Let your face get wet with hot water for at least 2 mins, put some shaving cream on a brush and stretch your skin out (only while brushing)  and brush your beard for 2 mins, fill your mug with hot water and dip your razor in the mug every couple of strokes. Shave in the direction of hair growth, never against and don\'t stretch it, if anything puff up your face! I make two passes, after the first one I re-lather and fill my mug up again with more hot water. And you don\'t need to leave the water on!!! That\'s what the mug is for. Try this for a few days and tell me, someone who has suffered for 7 years, that it isn\'t the best shave you ever had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now i use the Fusion exclusively. Some say the 5 blades is a gimmic, but i can feel a difference in that i dont cut myself at all, and the surface is wide enough to cut more at a time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1661,561,20061220,B000BUUVTE,3,"December 20, 2006",AFO6FV7G060UM,Is this the right razor for me?,"I have been using an electric razor for many years and have gotten extreemly poor result for some time now.  I finally switched to a manual razor.PG\'s Gilette sent me both the Fusion and the Mach 3 free, so I tried them both.  I think P&G\'s Gilette is trying to confuse me.  I like the Mach 3 better than the fusion becasue:1) smaller head makes it easier to get into those small places, true the fusion does have the one rear blade for this prupose but the head was so large that I was not able to get the blade into those hard places.  The Mach 3 was able to get the whole head into most of the small places which certainly beats getting just the one blade in there.2) While the Fusion\'s handle was well balanced so was the Mach 3\'s handle and the Mach 3 had better gripping surface then the Fusion did.3) Lower price on the Mach 3, IMHO, means that the Mach does not need to beat the Fusion just get close to it.  In my test the Mach 3 did better than the Fusion.In terms of the question that I posed in my title, as with everything else in life which is better for you depends on what type of beard you have.  Do you have a heavy beard and have to shave multiple times a day(like Tip O\'Niel) or are you a teen, then the Fusion is probably the best thing for you.  Do you have a moderate beard?  The the Mach 3 is probably more what you need.  Or if you have a light one that does not grow very fast, like mine, then the Sensor or the Sensor Excell is more of what you need.  I think that I am going to go for the Mach 3.I stuck with the electric razors for years thinking that the manual razors would nick and irritate my face.  The may have been true thirty years ago but not now.  Electric razors don\'t give you anywhere near as close a shave as a manual does.As for shaving gell goes, save your dollars and buy the Barbasoll brand.  Costs less and is much better than the Gillete Fusion gells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1665,565,20061122,B000BUUVTE,5,"November 22, 2006",A2VW7S9IRYL7VC,Best Shaver by Far,"As a Gillette Mach 3 owner, I decided to give the new Fusion a try.  Much to my surprise, this new shaver is hands down better than the previous model.  Cuts better, smoother and the five blades result in a faster shave.  Unlike the Schick Quattro, the Fusion is very easy to clean after use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1669,569,20061024,B000BUUVTE,4,"October 24, 2006",A2IO1ESNSIAXG3,Surprisingly good; definitely better than the Mach 3,"Surprisingly good; definitely better than the Mach 3. On the plus side it really hugs your face, shaves cleanly with a single pass, and doesn\'t nick or abrade the skin. Even the edges under the jaw line came clean. I hate shaving and often skip weekends yet find that it works quite well on one, two, or even three day\'s worth of growth. Haven\'t gone longer than that so I couldn\'t say for sure but seems like it\'d do okay for another day or two. Any longer and it would take a pass with an electric trimmer to shorten things up first. The handle is nicely ergonomic too, easy to grip and control when wet. On the minus side the single trim blade doesn\'t work horribly well, at least not for me. I\'ve got to even up my sideburns and trim around my goatee and this just doesn\'t do the trick. Considering what they cost, the blades don\'t last as long as I\'d like either. I\'ve used it regularly for about three weeks and it\'s just starting to dull enough to consider changing the blade. Might be able to stretch it another week but that might be pushing it. Considering that I can go a year with an electric model (Braun) on a single blade/screen set I\'d think they could make a manual that lasts more than a month...Despite the downside, it\'s the best manual razor I\'ve used so far. Quick, clean, comfortable shave... Got one as a free promotion and liked it enough to pick up a pack of refill cartridges. They are a bit pricey but not overmuch. I expect to continue using it for some time to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1675,575,20060506,B000BUUVTE,3,"May 6, 2006",A1YD2WQDJUQWS,The good and the bad,"First, the bad. The Precision Trimmer is way overhyped. In theory, it\'s a great idea: it\'s difficult to get sharp symmetrical lines using an ordinary razor, and one would think a single blade would do the trick a lot better. In practice, though, this doesn\'t work. In the first place, either the blade isn\'t sharp enough or it\'s burried too deep inside the cartridge to be truly precise. And secondly, whatever hairs it trims just get stuck in the blade - and it\'s a real pain to get them out.The good. Fusion isn\'t worse than Mach3. This was actually a great relief following the disappointment of M3Power which was a disaster. I can\'t say yet if Fusion gives a superior shave to Mach3 Turbo, but it stands to reason that five blades would perform better than three.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That\'s how I feel about this product.I wonder if the extra blades even do anything useful during my shave.  But the real question here is whether the \'power\' part of this product differentiates it at all from the non-\'power\' version.  Really, what\'s the difference?  I couldn\'t tell any during my shave.But...  Compared to the Schick multi-blade razors, the Fusion is incredibly better.  The wire that holds in the Schick blades makes for not as close a shave.  The Fusion\'s extra single blade is a great innovation, something they should consider for their single-blade model.Still, this all leaves me wondering if I shouldn\'t just get my own straight razor and avoid this monthly razor tax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was reluctant to try the  fusion, but a sample was included with my morning paper delivery a year ago, who would have thought to include it with the paper?Anyway, after using the first razor and cartridge, the closeness of the shave was incredible! I used it for almost 3 months before having to bite the bullet and buy cartridges.The shave from this razor is incredibly close, with no irritation. My beard grows every which way, leading to some discomfort with single or twin blade cartridges. This shaver, while refills can be expensive, provided a closeness in the shave I have never experienced before.I have achieved a longer use per refill, partly I think, because I do not use a traditional shave cream. I use \'Kiss my Face\' shave cream, which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge, while also providing a better and closer shave, with far less irritation.If you use this, try different shave creams, and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses. This will help to lengthen the life of the cartridges.One caveat... my beard is not thick, and I do sport a goatee, which may also help with longevity of cartridges. I currently use one cartridge every six weeks or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s an addiction but I have never been disappointed. This razor gets a 4 of 5 from me because of the price of the blades.

It\'s close, comfortable, and luxurious. Treat yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1702,603,20070227,B000BUUVTY,3,"February 27, 2007",A2CHKTBRQHDQQ8,Nice but a bit expensive,"Okay so they upped my blades from three to five, but I can still just stick with three.  I think I will do that for the fact that although I do really like these new blades, they are high in cost compared to the M3 I normally use.  I do like the way the blades are set neatly in the plactic molded container so you just retrieve them by sticking the handle in, hearing the click and then pulling it out.  The others I use have the plastic tabs you have to break off and then shake the blade out.  I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade.  It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill.  I did like the ones I bought to try, but will not buy more until they come down in price.  It is hard to justify spending that much money on these blades when a lot less money and a steady hand can still produce the same result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I smell noble price here!Don\'t let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn\'t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades?

I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless.  Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head.  When compared to the Mach3 which you had to use for this area the closeness is not even in the same league.  That\'s my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I\'ve used.  My only con is how damn expensive the blades are.  I\'m trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that\'s about the best I can do.

Some have thick fast-growing hair, some thin slow-growing, some medium thickness fast growing, etc. Everyone\'s different. Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don\'t need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it\'s what works for them.So far, these Fusion Power\'s are the best for me. My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors. The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3\'s came out, and the Mach3\'s were equally tossed when the Fusion Power\'s arrived. The reason - the 2 blades hurt, I cut myself lots, and wore out in one or two uses. Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut. These Power Fusions However, I must emphasize: *have yet to cut me*. I think the vibrate function is to thank for this, but I\'ve yet to cut myself when the battery runs out either, so it may just be the blade.Here\'s what Gillette does not want you to know though: these things last a LONG time. You can use one blade for months with minimal degradation of the blade quality, as long as you use the vibrate function and cream. How do I know they don\'t want you to know this? Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they\'d like, and so there\'s a whole marketing bend they\'re on about checking your indicator strips to see if it\'s time to replace. My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn\'t as quickly disposable.That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me. No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I\'m barely buying one pack a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In short answer YES!!!The FUSION follows every curve on your face like an Ariel Atom sticks to every curve and corner on the race track....The MACH 3 on the other hand feels live a Ford Festiva going around your face on 4 donut spare tires.Where the MACH 3 leaves short hairs for the 2nd pass the FUSION annihilates them in 1 pass.Where the MACH 3 lets your face feel like you need to shave again right after your done the Fusion turns your face into a smooth sheet of glass.My last point is that you need to invest in the Fusion cream (or some high end cream).

When I bought the M3Power, I assumed that I would never feel the urge to buy another razor because it had 3 blades (seemed like plenty) and had the power component, so what else was there?But then I started hearing about the Fusion and I read these Amazon reviews, and I decided to take the plunge and give it a shot (oh how I miss the days when they used to send the Mach3 free in the mail!). Costco has a nice deal where it is $18 for the Fusion Power with 4 blades (and handle) so I should be set for some time. I used each M3Power blade for at least a couple months without incident so the same should be true for the Fusion. I remember when the Mach3 first came out and it was recommended to change the blade every 3 months, but now because of that Aloe strip, they only last 3 uses? To me that is nonsense and wasteful as the blades themselves work just fine down the road and so do the microfins which IMHO work fine even if there is no more Aloe left!Anyway, I couldn\'t wait to have my first shave with the Fusion, and I couldn\'t believe how fast I was finished shaving my whole face! Because the blades are closer together, it felt as though I was shaving with barely even one blade, and I did not find that hairs got stuck between them which was my only concern with the design. With the power turned on, the razor went smoothly across my face, and I barely felt anything which is really what one wants when shaving. I personally don\'t like to go against the grain on my neck, but the Fusion did a decent job going with the grain so I was most pleased. The single blade on the back was nice for evening out sideburn hair and getting at those pesky under-nose hairs. Lastly I felt as though the pivot motion of the blade head was even more forgiving than the predecessors which made the transition between shaving my face and shaving my neck hair even smoother.The only gripes I have are its cost, but that\'s obviously a supply/demand issue, and its color which is orange and quite bright. I like the blue of the Manual Fusion better, but I like the power that I get from the Power Fusion, and since color is superficial, it is hardly a big point of concern. I just wonder if Gillette intended this color to displease people so they will be enticed when they come out with the Fusion \'Nitro\' or some other color scheme!Still this is the BEST razor on the market and worthy of a buy if you are like me and don\'t go through a razor head every week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s one of those things that I don\'t like to do.  So when I bought this razor with its promises, I found myself waking up excited to see if the shaver was really a cut above the rest.I\'ve never used one of these battery razors but had wanted to.  The 5 blades scared me a bit too....ouch, would that really hurt!  To my surprise, and delight....the thing ROCKS!It does give a smooth shave and seems to save me time...to my surprise.  Like others have mentioned, it is a bit bigger so a bit tougher to get under the nose....but it\'s doable.  The extra edge blade on the top is kind of cool...but I have only used it a few times.I think the three things that make this work are (1), battery vibration, (2) part under the blade that hits your skin first before the blades do....seems to lift the beard so blades cut better and, (3) five blades...5 makes a difference but the big difference is the closeness of the blades.  It seems this closeness makes it less likely that the blades cut me.  I seem to get less razor cuts.The only drawback I can see is the cost...I have had a hard time justifying the cost of razors in the past...seem too expensive, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.I highly recommend you try it.  By the way, shaving in the shower for 22 years...only use a mirror half the time.  Way to go.  I also highly recommend Aveeno shaving cream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1837,740,20060203,B000BUW8WM,3,"February 3, 2006",A32U73AM871FTF,Mediocre shave for your $3.50 razor cartridge...,"I have owned the Gillette Sensor Excel, Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, and Schick Quattro, among other lesser-known razors, and shaved with them all while being increasingly more disgruntled at how much a little piece of plastic and metal costs. While I was impressed with the Mach 3, and more so with the Mach 3 Turbo, when I switched to the Quattro, I knew that was the razor for me. Close shave, smooth glide, rarely any cuts at all even on my difficult-to-shave face. Recently when I went to the store, they were out of the 4-pack of Quattro blades, and so instead of buying an 8-pack, I decided to try this brand new razor from Gillette. I\'d never had a 5-blade razor before (let alone a battery-powered vibrating one) and so I decided to go all out, even though I was very disappointed to find that the cartridges cost $3.50 EACH.It comes in a nice easy-to-open clamshell package with a cheesy-looking but convenient holder that can either lay flat or stand vertically, which is what I prefer. It comes with a battery, which was very easy to install, and is touted as being shower-proof. I wouldn\'t know, because I don\'t shave in the shower.The vibration was not at all what I was expecting. I don\'t really know what I was expecting since this was my first powered razor, but when they say \'gentle micro-pulses\' I think of a soft intermittent buzz. Not so. This razor is strong, and it vibrates like a cell phone, constantly, insistently and very noticably. I was surprised by how strong the vibration was for a small appliance.I used my standard Gillette foam shave cream, and set to work trimming my face. The first thing I noticed is that I couldn\'t really feel the razor on my face as it vibrated and shaved my whiskers. The second thing I noticed is that I also couldn\'t feel when my face was clean-shaven while the razor was vibrating. I rely on the way the razor feels and sounds on my skin to know when I\'m done shaving a spot, and the vibration drowned out any noise or sensation or any other feedback I might have gotten from the razor. However, it didn\'t make that much of a difference, because I had to go over the same spots four or five times in order to make them clean-shaven. I\'m not sure what the 5th blade is doing, but I don\'t have to shave the same spots that many times with even an old blade on my Quattro. However, when I was done, the final result was a pretty good shave, with a few nicks here and there--the Fusion doesn\'t work well with bumps on the face when vibrating.I also used the single trimmer blade on my sideburns. It seems to work as advertised, and it is easy to use for accurate trimming of the sideburns. The problem, however, is that the single-blade end is no good for shaving a larger area such as your entire moustache, but the five-blade side is way too large for such a task. I found it very awkward to shave my moustache area with either end.Bottom line: I will be returning the Fusion and exchanging it for a set of replacement cartridges for my Quattro. It still outperforms the Fusion in spite of having one less blade in the area of comfort and shaving sensation, and the cartridges are $1.50 cheaper each. I may go back to the Fusion sometime, but if I did, it would be the manual version, never the vibrating version. This was my first and last experience with a battery-powered razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oh I\'m sure Gillette spent big bucks to make the fusion power blades stand up to the imense stress and vibrations that occurs during the blades one week lifespan.Most likely they just think people are stupid enough to either want the color coordinated ones or that customers will think something bad will happen if you use the non-power version blades. Or people will think the power ones are better.  Bottom line: Gillette thinks you are gullible. Buy the non-power blades.The overall shave is good if you shave everyday. For longer growth the mach3 is better since you have a wider spacing between blades to avoid clogs.As with the mach3 power the vibrations seem to give a better shave: soothes the skin, helps unclog the blades, might lift hairs better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I finally spotted it, I imediately purchased it, took it home and tried it.  So, does this razor live up to the hype?When I came home and took the razor out of the package I was glad to see that the battery (1-AAA battery) was included but I was a little put off that it only came with one razor cartridge.  I figured from past experience that there would be two but only one???  The razor itself has a decent weight and a nice shape so I quickly got over the fact that there was only one cartridge.I brought the razor in the shower, washed my face and applied my shaving gel and was preparred to be wowed.  I turned the razor on and it came to life with a solid hum.  The power button on it seems to be better than the M3Power\'s because it protrudes a little less and it seems less likely to be accidently turned off while you\'re shaving.  That being said, I began to shave.  The first thing I noticed about the razor was the size of it\'s head.  It seems rather large in comparison to the M3Power or even the Schick Quattro blades.  Even though it did seem bigger, it didn\'t seem awkwardky big and I was still able to shave without it being cumbersome.  The razor cut clean and smoothly though my beard and gave quite a comfortable shave.  The blades easily rinsed under running water even though they are spaced quite closely to each other.  I noticed on a few of my problem spots I still had to take multiple passes with the razor so in spite of having five blades, it couldn\'t perform miracles!  There was the single trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge too but it really didn\'t seem to be very functional.Overall I was quite satisfied with the quality and comfort of the shave.  The question that I have now is that, in spite of a good shave, is this razor worth the extra price versus say, the M3Power or the Schick Quattro?  Locally the refils go for about 30% more than the other \'older\' razors so, there is a signifigant price difference?Personally, I\'ll continue to use this razor for a little while and look for the cartridges to be on sale but I honestly don\'t think the Fusion\'s shave is that far superior to either the M3Power or the Schick Quattro to justify paying that much extra.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shave is closer than the M3, and much more comfortable; I\'d say 50% more comfortable. I am amazed at the quality of the shaving experience.However, I haven\'t lost my mind yet to pay almost 4 bucks a blade. I would if they lasted more than 2-3 shaves, but they don\'t. You can do the math, but $400/year for blades is more than I can stomach. I can well afford it, but somewhere you have to put a line in the sand and say, enough. This is ridiculous and Gillette is taking advantage of the marketplace. Right now, they clearly have the best product, and can charge whatever price they would like. The first alternative that arises, it\'s adios to Gillette for me.I\'ll stick with the Mach 3 for now because it\'s plenty good enough, and already way overpriced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are also really the MOST EXPENSIVE.I used the regular Gillette Fusion for years now - and just made the \'leap\' to get the Fusion Power.  Why now?  I mean the blades are ridiculously expensive as it is, what\'s another buck or two on top of that?!Tried it for the first time today.  It works well.  The vibrating is a bit weird - it\'s like a hand massage while you shave.  Shaving doesn\'t feel like shaving.  That vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with.  It certainly is painless to use.  It worked well - my skin is smooth.  No telling if it\'s smoother than the regular Fusion.  How could you tell?  I don\'t know if it\'s a gimmick or what - but I did like it.  I\'ll continue to use it, since I bought the darn thing and have no choice.~ EDIT 4/23/2010:  I now hate this thing.  Here\'s why: Within one or two shaves, the \'lubricating strip\' is completely gone.  After that first shave with a nice new blade, it hurts like hell to shave with.  It\'s as if the vibrating effect speeds up the wear and tear on the blades!  It\'s horrible.  It truly is.  On the weekends, after a couple days growth, shaving with this thing is horrendous - I\'ve never had a more painful shave.  The vibrating thing is just a gimmick: aside from that first shave with a new blade, it\'s not nearly as good as the other non-vibrating shaving razors out there.  I find areas all the time that it just did a horrible job on - rough spots.  I can\'t use it on my upper lip - because the vibrating makes my lips chap!  Even turned off, shaving HURTS with this thing!  I\'m throwing it out.  I had this old spare new Schtick razor I keep around and shaved with that a few days ago - WOW.  It\'s awesome!  So smoooooth.

Also, five blades has not reduced the number of required strokes when compared to the three on the Mach3 Turbo (the number of strokes is the same).

I get just as good a shave with a Bic disposable single blade so five blades really isn\'t better. Hell, THREE blades is unecessary (and two can be downright painful). I have purchased a Mercur safety razor which I think will hold me over for a good forty years as it is a tried and true antiquity, is a single blade, and the said blades cost like a buck for ten at Longs (standard double edge). Horrendous value cartridge-wise and not really a terribly good shave to boot. I really should probably have given it a one star, but hey, it works.

I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This razor is definitely the greatest item ever created for male hair removal. Shaving is no longer a pain anymore when I don\'t have to worry about the cuts, bleeding, and irritation that used to be associated with this everyday activity.

1918,824,20060710,B000BUW8WM,4,"July 10, 2006",A1AGRHWU7ZF042,Easy to please and hard to tell,"I should tell you from the start, I\'m a marketer\'s dream. I\'ve progressed over the years from an electric razor to progressively a one blade, two blade, three blade, and now a five blade gillette - battery powered and otherwise. Have I ever noticed a major difference moving one to the next - not sure - but like many others of you I tend to buy the latest just to say that I have it.Shaving differences well truth be told the biggest revelation for me was when I switched from electric to the one blade gillette - I\'d used the electric for twenty years since the time when I had to shave in the first place. What a revelation! The electric took for ever and seemed to grind your beard down much like a power sander. By contrast the one blade hand gillette was quick clean and gave you the impression that you\'d actually had a shave in the first place.Since then I suppose I have detected minor improvements as I\'ve progressed from one blade to two and more etc. But the changes are only apparent initially and you soon just don\'t notice, and they are sure not as marked as the transition from electric to manual. It\'s a bit like the difference between an expensive bottle of wine and a slightly cheaper one, or a good hi fi system and a not quite so good hi fi system - the differences are suttle - but there sure must be a big difference between a one blade and a five blade gillette. The only \'primitive\' razor I\'ve tried recently is a disposable and it is sure streets ahead of that.Aside from the disposable I\'ve never gone back to a lesser (ie fewer blades) gillette to test the extent of the improvement - perhaps I should. Anyway it\'s a good, well presented, piece of marketing - and as I said like many of you I\'d rather have the five blade than many that went before.Oh and by the way I don\'t cut myself with the five blader as I have with previous fewer bladed models so there is something tangible! Perhaps that is a good pointer to a better razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s amazing how few razors meet this criteria. The new unpowered Gillette Fusion razor does this better than the older Gillette model it replaced.For me, my beard tends to outgrow razors. I can live with one for a few years and then, suddenly, I find it no longer gives me a close shave. That\'s when I know it\'s time to change.What\'s different with Fusion is I need hardly any effort to remove facial hair and don\'t need much pressure from the hand or wrist. Just get the thing on my face and move it and it does the job even on my chin, under my nose, off my jawbone and in those other spots where lines are hardly flat or straight. The razor has another cutting edge on the back you can use for straight cuts to sideburns or elsewhere,  if you choose.I cut myself a few times the first time I used Fusion and was concerned the five cutting edges may be too much for me. But I quickly adjusted by releasing the pressure in my shaving hand and now take a close shave sans cuts for granted every morning of my life.Ergo, this razor meets my only criteria expertly.

Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse, she\'s one of those people that reads the manual on everything first, never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging (which she usually copies down in the store).I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present, but that\'s a whole other story. Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice. The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price. This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you\'re only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her, which she thinks is a must. Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The \'ease of use\' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter. Easier than oral, rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data, and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep, which caused my wife to scowl and panic, but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself. Sure, you can go to Target or Wal-Maze and buy yourself another cheapie, but then you\'ll be back exactly where you are now sometime later ... looking for a dependable and accurate ear Thermometer.This is currently the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently I asked my girlfriend to pick up some razors at the store \'not cheap ones please\' and boy was that a mistake. Anyway, I happened to be on Amazon already buying something so I looked at razors and decided on this one. I actually didn\'t know that it was a battery operated razor. I had used a Gillette razor before and it gave me a good shave. So when I got this one with the battery and stuff I was kinda skeptical but figured it would shave good without the vibrations so I didn\'t have to turn it on to shave if I didn\'t want to... I thought maybe it would just carve up my face like a Halloween pumpkin. The first time I used it I was very pleasantly surprised. I figured maybe it was just because it was a brand new blade, which always shave great the first time. I am here writing this review now because after a week and a half of using this thing with the same blade, it\'s still shaving closer than any shave I\'ve ever had before. Really. I have had close shaves before but could still feel where the hair would eventually come back again meaning it was close but like it was only cutting the hair even with the skin and this one seems to cut it even lower if that makes sense. I can\'t believe how smooth my face is. Truly smooth as a baby\'s butt. I have to actually take my time and pay attention now more than before, because if I miss a spot, I can really feel the difference. My girlfriend has really noticed the difference too... (don\'t tell her I said this but it\'s almost annoying how much she is touching and kissing my face now. lol)I didn\'t get any replacement blades with my original order, but I\'ve been looking at the local stores and all the prices have been twice what I see here on Amazon for replacement blades. The actual razor is about the same, but I laughed when I saw 4 replacement blades at Rite Aid for the same price I just bought 8 here on Amazon. I think I\'ll buy some more replacements to have on hand when I go traveling next month.I have no idea what the last reviewer is complaining about. This thing is great... and the extra blade for trimming sideburns is great, even helps me to get under my nose perfectly. I feel no danger of being cut. I really believe this is the most complete and closest shave I have ever had. Very satisfied.

Like all other variants, you can swap the razor blade and handles, which is convenient. The Embrace blade head has a large design. It\'s still more narrow than say, the Hydro Silk, to you\'ll ultimately need to make more passes because of the narrow path. However, the larger head didn\'t seem to impede shaving very much. I did notice that it tended to bend the wrong way when I was shaving from certain angles, which causes it to drag over my skin. I expected some irritation from it, but nothing happened. It feels a little weird when that happens, but there\'s no lasting effects.I get as good a shave from this as my Venus Divine, which I have always liked. This one has added an extra blade, but I\'m not sure if the shave is that much closer. This design is supposed to be more moisturizing, however. This is due to a large moisturizing strip that surrounds the blades themselves. I noticed that it felt, well, slimier upon first use. The moisture quickly dried up, however. Whenever I step into the shower to use this after leaving it sit, it gets a little moist once again, but it doesn\'t last. In my opinion, I wouldn\'t count on using this without shaving cream for any area other than under your arms.With that said, I\'m not ready to switch over from my Venus Divine.

In less than a minute, I had the case open and the razor up in the bathroom.But styling aside, is it better than a razor with only two blades?  The moisture added around the head is more effective, maybe even a tad oily. I didn\'t find the extra blades to make it any more efficient. I still gave it four stars because it does what it should and it doesn\'t have any glaring faults.**** EDIT: After using this for some time I have come to the conclusion that it is far better than a razor with only two blades.  It cuts shaving time.  And over time, I\'ve found that I have to shave less.  Due to having to take fewer swipes with the blade, I\'ve also found that my skin isn\'t as irritated.  I have fewer and less visible razor bumps/stubble. I haven\'t even had to change blades yet. I\'ve been using just plain cold water to shave and my skin also feels very moisturized.

Legs and underarms are shaved very clear. Skin usually smooth.  Essentially, I have been a satisfied customer.Now, here comes a new razor, the Yenus Embrace. The packaging is very attractive, green with seafoam blue as is the color of the razor itself. One positive aspect of the Gillette products is that you can actually get into the product through the packaging without spending ten minute tyring to cut into the plastic. There is a perforated entrance in the back of the package that opens easily. This razor comes with a cute little round receptacle that holds the razor and attaches to the shower head.  All of this makes the razor attractive but the real test is whether the razor works well. The Venus Embrace has 5 shaver heads and gives the smoothest shave I have experienced.  I would buy this razor again in a heartbeat. There is a protective ribbon of moisture that provides a smooth glide. This makes the razor an A+ item in my opinion.Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-07-08",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ShowerPod also holds extra razor cartridges which I found to be another great feature.I have to say it really does give you a close shave.

I could not believe the difference between my regular disposable razor and this one in terms of how smooth the Embrace felt while shaving.  In fact, I couldn\'t tell if it was doing anything--which felt weird at first because, with my regular razor, I can clearly tell that it is.  Even stranger was that, while I couldn\'t FEEL that I was shaving with the Embrace, I had razor burn when I put on my deodorant after shaving, whereas I usually don\'t have any razor burn when using my regular razor.  It\'s very possible that I may have unconsciously pressed harder because I was used to feeling my other razor and that caused the burn, so this could be \'user error\' and not a product fault.  Once I am more accustomed to using it and have broken out of my old habits with my old razor, I will have a better idea of which it is.Design-wise, the gel-grip handle is great for good grip in the shower, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the \'pod\' that sticks on the shower wall and holds the razor and the extra blade cartridge.  However, once I took the razor out of the pod to shave, I couldn\'t quite figure out how to get it BACK into the pod.  There is only 1 way it fits and it took me a few tries to find it (it seems obvious, because you know it has to fit into the pod at the narrowest point of the handle but, even with that assumption, it still took a few tries).All in all, I was impressed with the Venus Embrace Razor.  I took off 1/2 star because, while I love concept of the pod, I thought it should be simpler to get the razor back into it without having to think about it, and I took off another 1/2 star because I got razor burn when I don\'t usually (but as noted, that may have been my fault).Edited several weeks (and numerous uses) later to add:1. Once I got used to using a lighter touch with this razor vs. my old one, the razor burn problem substantially lessened to the point where I am having little or no razor burn now.2.  Once I got it in my head that the razor always goes back in the pod with the blades facing IN (which make sense), I have found it much easier to get the razor back in the pod without fumbling around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s not as effective as previous Venus style blades. The good part is it\'s nearly impossible to cut yourself with this head. It is so wide, and the blades so recessed, that they don\'t really scrape the skin the way you expect. For those used to using the larger Venus blades, this will take only a little adjustment, because it\'s a little wider than the earlier models. For those used to normal shaving heads, this will seem odd and will take quite a bit of adjustment. I don\'t know about using it on more delicate spots - I don\'t think I\'d try.The blades are spaced so that they are surprisingly easy to rinse and they don\'t clog. The handle is probably the best Venus has produced so far. The shower pod is ok - the suction cups actually stick to the wall as they should and it holds a couple of spare blades.If you have trouble with nicks, or if you have boney areas around your knees or ankles, I think you\'ll like this set-up. For my part, it\'s ok, but I\'ll be sticking with the previous Venus blades, which are the best available, and give a closer shave. I might nick myself once in a while when I wouldn\'t with this one, but it\'s worth it to me to get the closer shave. Someone with more sensitive skin might prefer this model, and the moisturizing strips are just right - not too \'gloppy\' but still improving the \'glide\' factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I did not experience any of the slick and greasy feel that another reviewer talked about- however, I have felt this with other Venus blades, and I think this is mainly on the first use, and tends to lessen as the blade is used more.I think the Venus line is great- the handle is easy to hold, the blades easy to attach, and the whole product glides easily over skin.

Not that I can tell.The head is HUGE - between the 5 blades, the moisture strips and the rubber \'comfort\' areas, it\'s a pretty massive beast, especially compared to the Soleil. This was a downside for me, as I felt that I couldn\'t necessarily see where it was going - especially in the bikini and knee areas.The rubber gripped handle is very comfy.Overall, it\'s just not my thing, though it\'s not a bad razor.

But I\'ve been ignoring the latest generation of razor blades because it seems the price has increased with each additional blade and innovation. While I don\'t want to have hairy legs or underarms, I\'m also economical and was skeptical over whether there would be enough difference in the results to justify the cost.  OK, so I\'m cheap - but life is expensive.The moving action of the blade reminded me of a Swiffer.  You don\'t have to put much pressure on the handle for the blade head to respond.  I initially thought the oversized blade might make it hard to stay with my leg, but it actually seemed to help. Despite the fact that the size of the razor blades themselves is probably about the same as the old Venus or another brand, it seemed like it took less time to shave my legs - maybe due to the fact the blade gripped my leg and I didn\'t have to keep going back to where I left off.I have to confess that the results of the Venus Embrace Razor may make it worth the increased cost - at least for those times when your legs or underarms are on display - like at the beach.  I felt as if I got a closer, smoother result with no nicks or scrapes than I have been getting from my 3 blade Venus razor, darn it all!  It\'s a great product, but I\'ll probably only buy for use during summer months; until I win the lottery, the $24.99 for 8 cartridges/blades is too expensive for everyday use no matter how much I like them.Update:  05/10/08 - I\'m afraid to say that having used the Embrace razor blades, I have now been ruined for the others.  I returned to my former blades and there was simply no comparison.  I thought maybe it was my imagination, but when I bought more Embrace razors, I found to my horror that they were every bit as good as I\'d remembered.  Save yourself if you want to avoid this expensive addiction and don\'t try them.  I have no doubt that if you do, you\'ll find them every bit as good as I have and won\'t want to shave with anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have the Venus \'Vibrance\' and am quite happy with it, but decided to try the \'Embrace\' out of curiosity because I cut myself so often with just about any razor I use.  At the same time, it seemed like something with five blades would definitely cut closer and get most of the hair without having to go over multiple times and irritate my skin.  The question is, does it really hug to your curves and get all of your hair in one shave and leave skin smooth?  Yes, it does do a pretty decen job of doing these things, but I didn\'t feel it is a whole lot better than my three blad vibrance blades, except that it shaves just a little bit closer, which is nice.  So, overall, if you have sensitive skin, this might be a good razor for you.  If you like to just shave over an area once and expect to get all of the hair, this is about as close as you will get to that.  God Bless ~Amy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was beginning to think that the competition to create a razor with the largest number of blades was getting ridiculous. I starting shaving my legs with the original single blade razors which did often cause embarrassing scrapes and cuts. The twin blade was a much heralded advance that resulted in a better shave and less abrasions. I even bought into the triple blade and was impressed, but  I drew the line at the quattro. This was getting ridiculous. Soon we would not have to move the instrument more than a millimeter to shave an entire calf. Come on!?The free vine product enticed me to try the Embrace five blade razor and its a winner. The shave was safe and incredibly smooth. I like the idea of the replaceable cartridge in the comfortable and light weight plastic handle. The case that suctions to the shower wall is a cute extra but not a reason to purchase this razor.

Therefore, this new razor has an appeal for me because it actually  1) feels good as I hold it (I make jewelry, and I like the feel of a well made tool in my hand--this razor, Venus Embrace, is almost ergonomically designed) and 2) feels good as it glides on my legs.The pod holder won\'t work out here, as we have children. Anyone who leaves an exposed razor in the shower, held by a pod wih suction cups, who has kids, is, of course, insane. I suppose I see the appeal of the pod for childless people, who want a razor which has a station where it can be \'docked\' to air-dry conveniently, and there IS a good spot for the extra cartidges to be stored inside.The pod looks like a small space ship or a mini house designed by a famous architect, or possibly it just resembles an egg. I enjoyed looking at it for a while before I locked it and the razor in the closet after using them.I definitely recommend this razor and I will continue to use it.

If I miss a spot, I can just go right over it without re-soaping leg. I have sensitive skin, so I was worried the five blades would irritate me but its been great, no irritation. Also these blades are lasting a long time. I\'m onto my 5th shave (both legs(thigh & calf) and underarms)and I\'m still getting a great super close shave.  These are definitely pricey, but as a splurge I\'d get them again and recommend to others. Also the little shower caddy does actually work.

The review by Cherise Everhard nails it.LONG VERSION: Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty must be reclining comfortably in her mansion in the Pantheon subdivision on Mount Olympus, counting the revenue from her licensing deal with Gillette. The sale of the razor blades alone must be quite profitable, allowing her to fill her closets with designer togas.This is one of those products that get written about in marketing studies. Where the basic item, a computer printer, for example, has a reasonable retail price but the ink refills are the longterm profit center. In this case, the razor is quite a good value, the price of the razor blades, however, leave you breathless!I myself was seduced by the allure of Venus when a women\'s magazine named the Venus Embrace Razor one of the beauty innovations of the year. (Yes, I read women\'s magazines! So what? This is a women\'s product! If you are a guy reading this review, you can just take off your judgemental hat and go back to watching the droning ball game on the sofa where you usually repose. Relax, have a beer!)Not being able to purchase Mach 2 razor blades anywhere for any price was causing me upset. I had a perfectly good razor that was totally useless. I bought a Soleil. It was French. It was pink-orange and white like a creamsicle. It was curved like a dolphin. It had three blades which was one more than the Mach 2 had. I was unimpressed.So, there I was, with a three bladed razor thinking that this was not nearly enough.Listen, hair removal is a tricky business. There are multiple solutions to the problem, some very, very bad and some very, very good. With chemotherapy and radiation being the very worst solutions, the best solution, in my admittedly fairly limited experience, is waxing. Unfortunately there are times when waxing is inconvenient. Like 10 minutes before you are planning to leave for the beach and you feel some stubble on your ankles. This is when you really need a razor.So I read about the Venus Embrace being an innovation of the year and I was hooked.What you get when you buy the \'starter kit\' is:- A pretty, ergonomically curved razor that has \'attractive sea foam green and turquoise\' (purple and teal) colored gel inserts on the handle. These cause a squishy/sticky feel that is not unpleasant but somewhat odd.... like holding a silicone spatula or a dog toy. The manufacturer claims that these gel inserts cause the razor handle to sit more firmly in the hand and not to slip.-The blade. The \'business end\' of the razor is HUGE! Its an oval shaped disk that contains five \'spring mounted\' blades that are surrounded by wide areas of plastic covered by variously colored slippery coatings that the manufacturer describes as \' Protective Ribbon of Moisture\'.-An extra razor cartride which comes packed in a clever, water-proof, sealed plastic container.-A plastic \'Shower Pod\' which is a small holder for the razor and extra blades that is supposed to attach to the bathroom tile with a suction cup.The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is the sticky/squishy feel of the razor handle. The blade cartridge sits safely in its sealed plastic container and is easily inserted on to the handle.The blade is sized perhaps for true Olympians like Venus Williams rather than mere mortal-sized women such as I. Did I mention is is HUGE? Paul Bunyon huge. Yo, Venus! Did you actually approve the size of this cartridge? I bet not.The shower pod is a tacky plastic thing that would not stay suctioned to my tile wall. It went directly into the trash.Although the razor head pivots, the blades are \'spring loaded\', there are moisture strips, and the handle is curved and tricked out with gel inserts, the Venus Embrace razor is unwieldy. It just doesn\'t go where you want it to go when you want it to go there. And when it goes there you don\'t really get such a close shave. I don\'t notice any better shaving than with my old Mach 2.What I have noticed about the Venus Embrace is that I have not cut myself once and I have not experienced razor burn. These were not significant problems with my Mach 2 but I thought I should mention them.My fundamental saddness with this product arrived when I needed to purchase additional blades and sticker shock set in. Three buckeroos a cartridge makes one think once or twice about continuing to use this razor. Sorry Goddess Venus, but that\'s one Sister\'s opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You\'ll have to decide if the extra performance of this razor (nice) is worth the $3.00+ for a refill blade (not so nice in my book).Will this razor replace my earlier Venus razors?

I have very sensitive skin, and am very prone to rash and break outs, so I was excited to try it.  I was a little dissapointed to find myself having an almost plastic burn from all the excess plastic they pack around the blades~~and while it\'s true the 5 blades give you a smooth, great shave, they almost shave too close.  I felt several times like I had razor burn, and actually skipped shaving under my arms one day because of the irritation.  I actually tried to give this the benefit of the doubt, and used it for several weeks, using several extra blades...I was just not impressed.  The shave was too close, resulting in bumps and an uncomfortable burn on my legs and underarms, not too mention the bikini area.  I want a smooth shave, but I don\'t want razor burn.I did, however, really like the grip and feel of the handle of the razor, and loved the handy dandy shower caddy, with the suction cups, and little cubby for extra blades.

It makes for a much more comfortable feel. I personally would have liked the handle to be a little bit wider, like maybe half an inch, but I\'m still pretty pleased with the shape and feel. While the Divine didn\'t slip in my hand very often, the Embrace doesn\'t slip in my hand at all, so there\'s less of a chance of a painful nick.The Embrace has a slightly larger razor head because of the \'ribbon of moisture\' strips around the blades. The larger razor head is a little annoying because I have to be more careful about maneuvering the razor over my \'bumps.\'However, I am extremely pleased by those \'ribbon of moisture\' strips. They make for an incredibly comfortable shave, much more so than the Divine. I could tell the difference in feel right away and it was amazing. Just that factor alone made this razor worth the price.The Embrace has five blades while the Divine has only three blades, and I can\'t really say I notice a difference in shaving efficiency or closeness because of the extra two blades. I *might* be able to feel a slight advantage to the extra blades, but I\'m also not entirely sure if that\'s all in my head or if it\'s real.The ShowerPod that comes with the Embrace allows you to snap your razor into place and store extra blades inside the plastic pod. It attaches to your shower wall via suction cups, which in my opinion is a huge improvement over the old Venus ShowerPods that required you to attach them with double-sided foam tape. The ShowerPod is a nice place to store the razor in the shower, but I honestly think the whole concept of storing extra blades in the shower is unnecessary. I never change my blades in the shower--I do it before or after--so in my opinion, the storage space in the ShowerPod is a waste of plastic.All in all, this is a great razor if only for the fact it\'s so much more comfortable than the Divine. Don\'t get me wrong, the Divine wasn\'t uncomfortable at all, but the Embrace has improved the model significantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know, I know, I could have purchased a razor holder separately, but I\'d never gotten around to it.  It\'s a nice little addition to this package.If I needed a new razor and handle, I\'d buy this one.  But I probably won\'t buy more Venus Embrace refills for it.

Overall, I thought the razor was really good. I have very sensitive skin, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn\'t have a razor burn from the 5 blades.  However, having been forewarned about that possibility, I used a lighter hand than I do with a 2 or 3 blade model.  I love the feature of letting it hang in your shower. Very nice with small children so I don\'t have to worry about it falling off the shelf into their reach.  I also could tell a noticeable difference with the moisture strips. My skin felt very smooth after just one use.  I like that the pivoting head made it easy to shave underarms and around the knees without knicks or remaining hairs.My only complaint, as one other person mentioned, was that the excessive amount of plastic on either side of the blades makes for a lot of extra work.  You think that you\'ve already shaved a certain part of the leg, only to realize that you must have only gone past it with the plastic.

One criticism she had was that the holder didn\'t stick to the shower wall very well. And since we use that same tub/shower combo to bathe our 3-year old daughter, safety is an issue.

And despite being non-battery operated the price of both products has remained the same.PROS:1. The rubber grip on this new model is top of the line.  There is a \'gel\' quality feel to it that creates a soft cushion to the fingers, but still maintaining a nice solid grip.2. The shaving head is a size XL!  This means even more moisture content to help protect and smoothen the skin while shaving.3. The in-shower storage has been redesigned from the all=time rectangular shape of previoius Gillette razors and formed into a pod shape which Gillette now calls a \'ShowerPod\'.  The modern design is visually appealing and should enhance the bathrooms.Another good thing is that there are two suction cups behind the pods to create an easy install process.  This is a great move away from the old stick tape which can be placed once only with no chance for relocation should you decide you stuck it to a bad portion.  With the ShowerPods, you don\'t need to overthink your location which gives freedom to shift or hide the razor as you please.4. FIVE (5) Blades.  This is a matter of debate.  I welcome more blades to help reduce having to go over the same area and refrain from skin irritation.  More blades also means the hair has more chances of being cut even deeper has the blades pass over the area.  But I am quite disappointed as well with the quality of the blades (which brings me to the cons...)CONS:1. FIVE (5) THIN blades.  Compare the quality of the blades from the old Gilette Venus razors to this new 5-blade system and you will see what they have become.  It seems Gillette has every intention to help consumers keep on replacing the blades more often than before.  The blades are so thin that they loose sharpness faster than ever making you wonder and evaluate how much you should really be spending on this aspect of personal grooming.Of course I welcome more blades in a shaving system to create a smoother shave.  To achieve such characteristic is to have the blades spaced very closely together.  By choosing to do this, you risk loosing other customers that have a thicker hair folicle since a smaller gap means the hair doesn\'t pass thru between the blades and ends up getting stuck.  In the process, the shaving system fails to work as intended and resulting to nicks and cuts.The solution is to frequently run the blades and shake it in a container of water (or running water if you don\'t have the heart to save water at this day and age) in order to loosen and remove any shaved hair that may have piled up in the shaving head.2. EXPENSIVE.  Sure buying a new shaving system is relatively cheap.  But if you still haven\'t learned from the PRINTER/INK CARTRIDGE market, you should watch out for the price of replacement heads especially for newly introduced technology like this.3. MARKET LIFE.  As with Gillette products and marketing, they always have something up their sleeve.  So I wouldn\'t be surprised if they have a powered version ready for market release or a simple change of color depending on the theme of the times.  So you invest in a pack of replacement heads from your local wholesale warehouse and  before you know it, you are marketted another revolutionary shaving idea.4. COLOR/DESIGN.  The color is really wonderful and in time for Spring, but displaying it with your white ShowerPod may not fit all bathrooms.  Yes, it\'s a shaver but it still is built to be displayed within easy reach at the shower for convenience.  But give us a more neutral color like WHITE!  In fact make an ALL WHITE SHAVER and call it the GILLETTE VENUS ANGEL.  Together with the ShowerPod, that should be a better option for most bathroooms.CONCLUSION:Yes, the Venus Embrace is great.  You have created a five blade system and beat the competition once again.  The gel handle is the highlight of this release together with a very big shave head to help create an even smoother experience.However...What I would really like consumers to experience is a better shaving system with a head that lasts longer.  With all the manufacturing techniques, why not create blades that are not only sharper, but also maintains the sharpness.  This should be more convenient than having to stack up tons of replacement blades in the bathroom.  Make use of stronger and lighter materials like Schick\'s use of TITANIUM.  How about go seal the deal in technology and create a PORCELAIN-coated BLADE.  Anything as long as you can give us an idea that you also care for us to save.  In turn, we will create the illusion that we will also be loyal to the brand until the day we die.I still have a problem with the close spacing of the blades creating clogged hair in between them.  The idea of more blades will create cutting shaving time may not hold true since you will have to do more steps in loosening the hair particles in water.Overall, this is another winner in shaving experience.  But it\'s what we would expect from a manufacturer who wants to introduce better technology and ensure a steady replacement of expensive shave heads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I shaved my legs twice without replacing the head, and the second time was really not that satisfactory. In addition, the refills are PRICEY! They end up being over $2 apiece at the Amazon price or more than $3 apiece at the regular retail price.* The multiple blades trap longer hairs, so if it\'s been more than a couple of days since you\'ve last shaved your legs (so sue me -- it\'s not exactly shorts weather in Michigan right now!), you\'ll find yourself CONSTANTLY rinsing out the head.

Didn\'t taste very good.Secondly, when showering the next day it leaves an odd waxy residue that literally has to be rubbed off (it catches your finger).But I suppose that\'s why it\'s such a powerful antiperspirant and deodorant.Both are fairly non-issues, but are important to consider if looking at all of your options.If you can live with it being a bit messy, it\'s definitely a very powerful deodorant and antiperspirant.At the current discounted price it\'s around 4 bucks each in the pack of 6, which is a bit expensive-- but it\'ll definitely keep you fresh all day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was amazed at how much better it is that all the other stuff I tried.  After I used up that can, I bought this 6-pack from Amazon.

The pivot point of the Atra is in the middle of the blade, which acts like a seesaw fulcrum: if you have the right pressure but a slightly wrong angle, the Atra will pivot to a more correct angle and shave well; if you have the wrong pressure but a good angle, it may result in irritation; and if both your pressure and angle are bad (like me), then it may result in irritation with nicks and cuts (and razor burn).Unlike the Atra, the pivot point of the Mach-3 is at the bottom of the blade: if the angle is wrong, then the Mach-3 will pivot to a better angle; if the pressure is a little too strong, the Mach-3\'s pivot will also correct for that; and if both the pressure and the angle are bad, then the Mach-3 may result in a good shave regardless of how much your shaving technique sucks.More blades may mean more irritation for people with sensitive skin, so Mach-3 is the highest I want to go.  If there is a (cheaper) two-blade razor with a bottom pivot, then I will try it.  I noticed similar irritation when I used the Sensor two-blade razor, and I think that the reason was due to the pivot point and my poor technique.  I really wanted to keep using the Atra because the price is much better, but it just didn\'t work for me.  If I ever learn good technique then I will start using a double-edge safety razor, but until then... it\'s Mach-3 for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

      </div>

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

There really isn't a whole lot to say about this. It works, it smells good, it keeps me smelling good and not sweaty. That's about it.

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

      </div>

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

      </div>

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

This stuff is incredible. The sweatiest of the sweaty and the stinkiest of the stinky will be really happy with this product. I've had better luck with it than anything else.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

      </div>

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

	5	""May 20, 2010",A12DQZKRKTNF5E,"Works well, smells good;  for men and women","I\'ve had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I\'m 42 now) I\'ve found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it\'s simply a \'clean\' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don\'t find it competing with my perfume and haven\'t noticed it to be overpowering.Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.The product isn\'t invisible and will get on your clothes if you\'re not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can\'t find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about \'pitting out\' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4003,1379,20090528,B001F51QJ8,4,"May 28, 2009",A3L2KYOYDWSRPL,Works but..............,"It really works in terms of decreasing the amount of armpit sweating. I was skepitical initially as they say that it needs to be applied at night. You could still apply it in the morning after a shower if you desire. The only compliant I have is a dry chalky fealing in the armpit, which usually happend with pretty much all anti-prespirants, but was more with this one. If you are an extremely sweaty guy, then this is the one for you .............",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4005,1381,20090513,B001F51QJ8,4,"May 13, 2009",A2BVOBG7YDSVOZ,"Effective, Transparent, and Pleasant","This is one of the best anti-perspirants I\'ve ever used. Unfortunately, the price is quite high and I can\'t imagine spending around $10 for a single stick.The product goes on smoothly and doesn\'t chalk up like competitive products. It was absolutely effective for me for 24 hours. The instructions advise putting it on the night before; I tried using it in the evening and starting off with it in the daytime, but didn\'t notice a significant difference.The product has a pleasant and extremely subtle scent. You\'ll know that that you\'re wearing it when you\'ve just applied it, but it definitely won\'t overpower any cologne or perfume you might be using.Overall, this I found Gillette\'s Clinical Strength Anti-perspirant to be an effective and smooth product. It\'s just expensive compared to its competitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4007,1383,20090509,B001F51QJ8,3,"May 9, 2009",A3D9BTRM4JOU41,Strength at what cost?,"\'There\'s no free lunch,\' as they say. You can\'t get something for nothing. With this product, you get extra power; but you have to sacrifice some comfort and convenience to seal the bargain.First, let\'s get the obvious part out of the way: this stuff does a fine job of keeping you dry. In that regard it works as well as any antiperspirant I\'ve tried. Like other \'clinical strength\' products, the directions tell you to apply before bed at night, and explain how the product works by plugging up your pores so the sweat can\'t get out. I can\'t say that sounds too healthy to me, but after using a whole package, I didn\'t get a rash of any kind.Now, the sacrifices: in general, your underarm areas are going to feel weird. They\'ll feel tacky or rubbery to the touch, as though they\'re coated in dried rubber cement, especially for the first few hours after you\'ve applied the product. This might not bother everybody, but I didn\'t like the sensation.Finally, the elaborate packaging has a fatal flaw. You turn a little knob three clicks at a time to meter out the right dosage. The knob gives  satisfying loud click, and the packaging is strong and opaque. There\'s no squeezing or fooling around. But one day, you\'ll turn it one or two clicks and it will simply stop: the product will be all gone, but there will have been no warning. There\'s  just no way to tell when you\'re about to run out; this could leave you in an awkward position on the day of that big presentation...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4018,1394,20090420,B001F51QJ8,3,"April 20, 2009",A2FWZ58M6IQMD7,"Eh...it\'s ok, but really not worth the high premium","I\'m a longtime underarm sweater, and have had most success with Old Spice antiperspirants.  I decided to give this Gillette a shot, and needless to say, was a little disappointed.Does it keep my drier?  Well, when used correctly (apply at night, which was hard to get used to) and not washing underneath my arms in the shower in the morning, it worked slightly better than what I\'m used to.  The problem is, however, that it\'s not realistic.  Sure, I can get used to applying deodorant on at night.  But can I get used to NOT scrubbing underneath my arms during my morning shower?  Ummm...no.I tried the unscented kind, which was fine - literally no scent.  I experienced no irritation or any other kind of side effect from it.I ended up being slightly drier, but still sweaty using the Gillette.  I\'m sure everyone is different, and maybe I\'m a profuse sweater, but it just didn\'t work enough for me to justify the premium (costs over twice what I normally get for marginal results).It might be worth a shot if you\'re desperately looking for a solution to underarm perspiration.  It\'s certainly a cheaper alternative than paying for $700 Botox injections every 6 months.  But don\'t expect this to be the answer to your prayers.  At least for me, it certainly wasn\'t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4021,1397,20090416,B001F51QJ8,5,"April 16, 2009",A2QR043WBXXX6L,Handles the work load,"My husband was not too thrilled with the direction about having to apply the product before bedtime, since he is a morning shower type of guy...  But after using the product for a couple weeks, he was impressed with the anti-perspirant ability.  He\'s been working on a home remodel, and as the temperatures are warming up, he\'s still happy with the dry feeling.  I tried it too, and although I prefer a drier stick type application, I can\'t fault the way it keeps me dry. It\'s a keeper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4022,1398,20090416,B001F51QJ8,5,"April 16, 2009",A37JNUJSVAJKYN,Wroks Great,"There are times when we all have had our deoderant fail us!  I work in an enviroment that is always warm, and I am doing a lot of physical labor usually leading to my deoderant failing.  I used the Gilette Clinical Strength and did not have it stop working.  I like the fact that this anti-perspirant does not have a smell.  I think it is a little costly for what you get, which is not very much, I spent awhile just to get the stick started.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4024,1400,20090416,B001F51QJ8,4,"April 16, 2009",AOP41SVJTXNBN,Works if you follow directions,"This is a decent \'clinical strength\' antiperspirant product -- it works if you follow directions.  That is, you need to apply this at bedtime in order for it to work optimally.  The package insert explains why -- applying the product before you sleep allows it to \'form better plugs\' -- which, while disgusting-sounding, is how antiperspirants tend to work -- the aluminum compound plugs and temporarily deactivates your sweat glands.  So your armpits will also feel kindof nasty and coated when you go to wash them next, but so it goes with this type of product.  The package insert also explains that the aluminum compound in this particular product is different from that used in most antiperspirants, and that it allows for less irritation and better performance -- I can\'t really speak to the accuracy of those claims as I\'ve never experienced irritation or problems with other brands.The scent of the product is mild, and quite unisex.Overall, this product does what it says if you follow directions -- but I\'m not sure I\'ll use regularly as I\'m not fond of the way it makes my underarms feel.  I\'ll reserve it for weeks with major important activities like public speaking engagements, interviews, and my wedding!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4033,1409,20090408,B001F51QJ8,4,"April 8, 2009",A1RXLZY53ZQ6UT,Gillette Clinical Strength Advanced Solid Anti-perspirant,"I found that this was an excellent product. The good news is that is does a super job without leaving those powder markings on your clothing. It is gentle on sensitive skin.Since this is such a super deodorant I suspect someone who is in a high stress job, either physically, mentally, or both, that causes a lot of perspiration, would find this product worth every penny. The only down side for me was that I do enjoy a nice smell to my deodorants, this is fragrance free. Bottom line, it\'s worth every penny",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a solid but not in the traditional sense, at least it does not resemble the solid deodorants that I\'ve used in the past.  On the top where the deodorant comes out, after you\'ve turned the bottom \'clicker\', there is a plastic \'grid\' through which the deodorant comes through.  It takes on a less solid form and is easily applied under your arms.  I have not noticed a scent with this product.  This is fine by me, as long as it does what it\'s supposed to.  It will keep you dry, even when the temperatures hover over 80 during March and the sun beams at you like it\'s your best friend.  It is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4043,1419,20090331,B001F51QJ8,5,"March 31, 2009",A1FWFCJU2G7TRA,Works well and totally unscented!,"This Anti-perspirant works well without causing irritation. I have sensitive skin and I had no problem, even during work outs. There is no scent which is nice because many of the \'clinical\' anti-perspirants are scented. Nice glide action as well. I will buy this product again!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In summary:1) I shave every other day (work from home) and each razor easily lasts the week.2) The triple blades provide a shave nearly as close as the five blade system I was using (the latter became too expensive).3) The razor\'s shape and grip were pleasant surprises (the former provides easy access to the hard to reach places and the latter just makes shaving easier).No real negatives at this point.

Every good marketer knows that new product introduction is the lifeblood of a category.  So Gillette continues to introduce razors with seven blades, swivel handles, a new formulation of \'slime\' or skin irritant (that they call lubricant)on the head, and other useless and unwanted features to keep a fresh product in the market.  All the while, they have this tried and true, absolutely tested and proven product that they have never been able to improve in the last (30+?) many years.

How many blades are the new guys up to now? Six or seven?  Ridiculous.

For me, the soft rubber \'rumble strip\' that Gillette adds to these newer models just gets in the way and prevents me from getting as close a shave as I get with the good old Sensor. Another problem with the Gillette Fusion is the location of the pivot point between the handle and the cartridge; it\'s just plain awkward. That, coupled with the ribbed rubber strip, creates major shaving frustration. In any case, Gillette makes the best blades, at least for thick barbed wire beards like mine.

I\'ve been using Gillette Mach3 Turbo blades for years, and frankly got tired of paying $3.05/per blade at my local grocery store. I shopped Amazon to look for a cheaper price, and came across these Sensor3 disposable blades which are getting fantastic reviews (for some reason). I thought I\'d give them a try, seeing how they\'re almost 1/2 the cost (per blade) as my non-disposable Turbo blades. WHAT A MISTAKE! These blades are comparatively very dull right out of the box compared to the Turbo blades, and I\'m lucky if I can get 3 shaves out of them before needing to throw them away.

Any other razor blades, made by either Gilette or other companies, including the expensive ones like MACH III, will simply cut me. Then Gillette stopped making them, with no reason whatsoever, probably it worked too well, like the light bulb that will last 100 years.  I complained to their customer service with no avail (they are really not a very customer responsive company)  My friend was smart, he bought a whole bunch from K-Mart when they went out of business.

Otherwise, it\'s the same razor.For those who have not used a Venus razor:There are three main features of a Venus razor versus a standard multi-blade women\'s razor.The first is the soap/gel bars.  These bars basically provide the glide that you usually get from shave gel or foam.  You can definitely shave without lathering up.  That saves you time and cost.  However, the bars do mean that you have to press a little harder than you might be used to when the razor head is new to get a close shave.  (As the bars wear down from use, you don\'t have to press as hard.)  Until you get used to this, you may notice some unintended stubble.  Also, the bars make it a little tough to clean the razor.  I\'ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I\'m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  It\'d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  I really liked the scent on this one, and I\'m not normally a fan of shave gel scents.The second big feature of the Venus line is the easy-to-change razor head.  When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  Then, you open a sealed replacement head and click the handle into the slot.  It\'s a much safer and easier replacement process than razors I\'ve owned in the past.  Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it\'s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  Each razor head is individually packaged, so it\'s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  You don\'t have to worry about cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.The third feature is the hanging rack.  The Venus razor kit comes with a mounting rack for your shower.  The rack sticks to the shower wall using adhesive pads, and it holds 4 replacement blades (not included) and the razor with a blade attached.  I\'ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  Gillette didn\'t improve on this design for the Spa Breeze line.  I was hoping they\'d offer a suction-cup design.  Also, the design is such that you can\'t really use it unless you wall mount it.  The razor needs gravity to stay in place, and because the bottom of the rack is rounded, you can\'t just set it vertically on a shelf.  I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.As for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  I have very fine hair.  Many razors just aren\'t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I\'ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)All in all, the Venus line is excellent.  I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  I\'d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The triple blades are usually very long lasting, but with the irritating little pads dragging along your shaving surface, the long-life blades become an unusable waste.

It was also too wide for sensitive areas.When Amazon offered this one I was a bit skeptical at first but decided to try something made specifically for a woman. I\'m glad I did.

So far I\'ve managed four shaves off of one blade and I anticipate more.  The blades come in sealed containers so you don\'t have to worry about the unused ones becoming soggy in the case.The gel soap bars that frame each side of the head are holding up well and also serve to keep the razor from \'digging\' and \'snagging\' like my earlier purchase. I have very sensitive skin and the pleasantly scented gel does not irritate me. I\'ve found my new razor!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4242,1624,20090508,B001JQLNFA,4,"May 8, 2009",AWIF8AR75LL9L,Nice razor not sure about the holder,"I am enjoying the Gillette Venus Spa Breeze razor so far.  It is similar to the Embrace Venus razor, but the Embrace has rubberized strips that make the blades float above the skin.  The Venus Spa Breeze Razor has two strips of very hard milled soap on the top and bottom so that you do not have to use soap or shaving cream/lotion when you shave.The soap is not overly scented.  It is not overly lathery either, which surprised me.  It is quite solid and does not melt easily, which is good because you won\'t blow through the soap before you finish the razor in sharpness.The soap does have sodium lauryl sulfate (and some relatives) in it which I avoid in my skin care products, but it is not a large amount and it did not leave my skin parched when I got done using it.The storage rack that comes with the Spa Breeze Razor is nice but I don\'t like the way it attaches to the wall.  It has two square adhesive strips that you are supposed to attach to a clean shower wall and then hang the case up on it with little knobs that hook it in.  I don\'t like that idea- there is too much risk of sticky being left behind being yet another challenge in cleaning the walls of the shower once it has lived through its usefulness and has to be removed.I have given this four stars because of the case mounting idea, and the fact that I don\'t like this razor quite as much as the EMBRACE by Venus.  The EMBRACE seems to shave closer and more easily than the Spa Breeze Razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Green Tea scent is very \'spa-like\' and feminine.  The blade contours all the nooks and crannies of my body wonderfully and there wasn\'t one nick at all.  Over the years I have been a loyal follower of the \'Intuition\' razor and \'Veet\' line.  I don\'t like buying shaving cream seperately and find that the cream clogs the razor from doing its job after all.  The downfall of the \'Intuition\' was that the head was rather clunky at about an inch height and the soap part would wear down rather quickly.The Venus has a soft pink head that is actually very gel-like in feeling.  I used it to shave my legs, under arms and bikini area and haven\'t seen any wear on the jelly heads that surround the blades.  The actual handle feels great in my hand; especially the little spot on the head where I place my finger to control the pressure that I apply whilst shaving.  Very thoughtful product that was truly tested.  My one only complaint at the time is that shaved hair gets caught underneath the jelly sides.  I have to manually go and remove all the hair each time.... which is rather annoying.You get two head cartridges with that delightful scent and case that will hold the cartridges and handle.  You can even hang it with the \'stickies\' supplied.  I haven\'t tried the \'stickies\' because from past experience they either fall or they stick to the tile forever while the product is on the floor.  I wish companies would jump on the suction cup back like the \'Intuition\' provides.Highly recommend the product because I did not have one nick or any bumps after shaving.  Very smooth, close shave for a sensitive skin user here!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have two, one in my shower and one in my travel bag. Now there\'s a disposable Venus, though, and I am thrilled! It shaves just as cleanly and easily as my Venus Divine. I love having a disposable with the built-in moisturizing strips so that I don\'t have to carry shaving gel or rely on hotel soap or shampoo. I don\'t often like scented products -- I like to choose my own scents -- but the scent of the moisturizing strips/gel bars is subtle and unobtrusive. The Venus Breeze is lightweight and easy to use in the shower. Its handle is lightly textured and easy to hold and I had no problems with it slipping during use in the shower.

So what you are left with is a razor with NO lubrication, and you end up having to use soap or shaving cream anyway if you want to get the full life out of your blade.

I smeared it intentially on some black cotten clothing, and although I could see the substance, it turned clear not white.As for the rest, on a hot day, and me without an air conditioned car, I came home smelling OK.  I was still dry under the arms, and smelled the scent of the stick (\'Artic Ice\') instead of me.  I don\'t really think this is the smell of ice, artic or not, but it smells pretty good, somewhere between a slight floral, and citrus blend.After that it\'s just like the other sticks out there, the active ingredient in most, Aluminum Chlorohydrate, is a known drying agent, so it helps evaporate sweat before it has a chance to soak you.  Like most of these new sticks, part of the staying power is that they are water resistant, so apply after the shower, not before.  Good stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4412,1800,20120403,B003983HRI,3,"April 3, 2012",A21N3CFERVUT0I,Less Than Impressed,"I bought this razor 3 days ago and first shaved with it with about 36 hours of growth. I\'m a 5-6 day a week shaver, so pretty regular. And I will also say I H-A-T-E shaving. Man\'s face was never meant to have a sharp object ran across it to take hair off. That\'s what I believe.For all the talk of these razors having a smooth shave, I\'m not that impressed. It feels different than the Mach 3s I\'ve been using since the late 90s, when they came out. Probably because it\'s a wider surface moving across my face. The features of my facial hair are: Relatively fine, not thick, but tough. And along my neck the hair grows in at least 3 different directions making shaving that much more frustrating. I will also add there is a spot along the left side of my larger than average chin that consistently gets missed. I must run the blade over it at least 3 times, and by that third time, my face has had enough and is quite irritated. I don\'t believe I had that problem with the Mach 3s.I posted a comparison shot of this razor (they are placed upside down relative to the camera, too). The one on the left is after 3 uses. The right has not been used. Notice the glide strip appearing on the bottom-it\'s half gone! I don\'t know if the metal will last the weeks I\'ve been reading about, but that strip isn\'t going to! I don\'t anticipate having a anything near a smooth shave if I let those blades touch my face a few more times, not based on my years of experience.AND...I must also note that I have well water that is VERY hard. You can see the calcium build-up on the sides. I believe that probably shortens the life of any razor.I don\'t doubt the guys who say they have gotten good use from this blade. I haven\'t, and likely won\'t, so I will eat the 10 bucks I spent and go back to my Mach 3s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The razor does a fantastic job of eliminating even the finest hairs on my face, and with a tremendous deal of comfort to boot.For my teenage cohorts-don\'t hesitate getting this razor. Although it may seem steep in price, the amount of times we actually shave per month makes it a very reasonably priced razor for the price. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4421,1810,20100721,B003983HRI,3,"July 21, 2010",A2V1BKESGGFESJ,"Good razor, but still a bit rougher than I\'m used to","I will say that this is a good razor, but I am still searching for the perfect razor.  I will also say that my beard typically comes in patchy and the hair on my face is usually pretty coarse.  Everyone\'s face is different and this should be taken into consideration.  This razor feels very comfortable in my hand and perhaps even lighter than most razors.  Traditionally, I have shyed away from Gillette razors as they have a tendency to provide a more painful shave for me.  There seems to be more tugging and pulling then other razors I have used.  I have always found that a Schick Titanium typically gives me a more comfortable shave.  The Proglide is no exception as I still found it to be pulling a bit much to my disappointment.  I also noticed a bit more irritation on my face the next day, but nothing too bad.  However, I will say that this is, by far, the closest shave I have ever had with any razor.  I believe I actually said \'wow\' when I was done shaving.  In my mind I had to determine what the trade off was.  More comfortable versus closest shave.  For now, I am sticking with the Gillette in hopes that my face gets a little more used to it.I knocked off two stars for the following reasons:1) Price!  The razor is not too expensive, but a 4 pack of blades is about $16 at my local gorcery store.  By far, the most expensive blades in the aisle.2) Lack of comfort...it tugs and pulls a bit...and left my face slightly irritated.Overall, its a good razor.  It\'s not quite a comfortable as the Schick I used, but I am pretty darn excited at how close the shave is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That does come to be the case with the Gilette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor. I like it because it gives a strong clean cut shave right out of the gate when you use it. My biggest gripe though is that only after a few times because the blades in the cartridge are so thin, the razor does become quickly dull to the edge. So even to the visible eye, you lose that shave and you\'d have to earn those wings by quickly getting a refill for your Gilette razor. While it is a great concept, it can be a easier waste of money only after a short time. Hopefully, Gilette can come out with a razor that can be closer to the edge.Price: CConvience: COverall: C",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I rushed to the computer as soon I was done shaving to type this.  This is just an opinionated post so I\'ll keep it short and sweet.  But for a long time, I was using the Mach 3 but I had a lot of issues with it.  I have very sensitive skin in my mustache area so I always had a problem with cuts or it would tug at my facial hears and cause pain.  So much so that I switched to electric razor for the past 5 years.  But with electric, it was frustrating because I could never get the satisfying shave a blade can get me.After seeing all the advertisements for the Proglide I couldn\'t resist so I decided to try it out.  I put on some shaving cream and tried this bad boy out and it sent chills up my spine as I glided this thing across my sides and chin.  I even went against the grain and it was just so smooth.  Now for the ultimate test.... I grimaced as I anticipated pain as I was about to shave my mustache area and I couldn\'t believe how it just cut away at all my hairs.  And immediately I went against the grain and no cuts, not tugs, nothing.  It felt like licking ice cream.  I have not had my face so bare and smooth like this ever.  It\'s totally liberating!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4426,1815,20100618,B003983HRI,4,"June 18, 2010",A5OMBQZR177MZ,Underwhelming Improvement,"I was excited about the new Proglide series, so I actually pre-ordered mine weeks in advance.  My previous razor was Mach 3 Turbo, and I have never tried any of the fusion razors until now.My initial reaction was that it\'s not that much better than the mach3 razors i have been using.  I remember the feeling of amazement after my first mach 3 shave having switched from a two-blade Schick - but this time, the improvement, if at all, seemed marginal.  I imagine this is what Apple goes through when they release a new iPhone - nothing will match the excitement of the very first model.I am not convinced that the \'thinner blades\' are actually better - seems like this may just be another marketing ploy to get away with cheaper materials.With all that said, I tried using the proglide a few more times and thought that it worked consistently well every time - and I was actually able to get a very close shave with a single path \'against the grain\', and without any skin irritation at all.

Oddly enough, my shaving rituals are contrarian. While King Gillette invented the safety razor, I prefer Schick products (until now). In electrics, I prefer Braun, which is a Gillette subsidiary. Weird, huh?My new razor, and my all-time favorite so far is the Emjoli.

Of course, I also hated the 5 o\'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could.

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

This was a great deal for the price.  $4.20 with free shipping.  I have used these shavers for several years and I like them.  I'll use this one when I travel.

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

This was a great deal for the price.  $4.20 with free shipping.  I have used these shavers for several years and I like them.  I'll use this one when I travel.

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

The razor works well and gives me a nice clean shave, and is an improvement over anything else I've used.

This was a great deal for the price.  $4.20 with free shipping.  I have used these shavers for several years and I like them.  I'll use this one when I travel.

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

5551,1851,20110602,B003983HRI,4,"June 2, 2011",A3KF6V6LYERN6X,"Great razor, but not a huge difference over Fusion","I\'ve used the last generation Fusion for a few years now. I got a great deal on the Fusion Proglide so I decided to try it out. It is very similar to the Fusion, but with slightly less tug and pull. I also discovered that Proglide razor heads fit on the older Fusion handle, and vice versa. So if you want to switch, there\'s not much reason to buy the handle too. I gave it 4 stars because it\'s still a great razor, but more of a .5 jump in evolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When they move over my face, I can feel that they \'catch\' the hair near the root.2. Very easy to clean after shave. With a little warm water rinse, the blades are ready to use. In comparison, my old blades always got some \'stuff\' between blades. I needed to use Waterpik to flush it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Always though it would be too much trouble, or I was going to hack myself up.  Well, the other day I saw the commercial for Gillette Fusion Proglide and it sparked my interest.  If it does what it says, I was finally ready.  I was tired of the electric razor, shaving my neck was always a difficult adventure, always had to pre-shave so that the hairs were not too long, or the electric would yank those hairs out!So I finally took the plunge, while out picking up a few things, I grabbed the Gillette Fusion Proglide, and took it home, hoping that it was as easy as it sounded.  Since shaving with a electric was a different animal, and I wasn\'t sure how to go about it, I checked out the Gillette site to find a nice video on pre-shaving rituals, and much more.So after dinner I went at it, this rookie prepped his skin and hairs, and foamed up with the gel that came with the razor.  I started slowly, and softly, and there was barely any feeling.  As I started to figure out how much pressure I could use, and what was the best direction to shave the parts of my face, it was a snap.The first shave took me as long as my electric, but I that\'s the first time rookie shave, it will, and did get easier as I went along.  It was sooooo easy to shave my neck, and absolutely no tugging, and didn\'t get a nick or cut.Being the first manual razor I\'d ever own, and being an absolute rookie at this, the Gillette Fusion Proglide was  the best shaving experience I\'d ever had, and I would recommend the razor to everyone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides the addition of 2 blades, technology hasn\'t improved at all as it shaves nearly identical to my old manual razor (3 bladed). Think I\'ll stick to my Norelco electric from now on as it gets just as close (if not closer). Not sure if this razor was even worth the 3 bucks I paid for it.

It doesn\'t shave any more closely and comfortably than my triple blade, which didn\'t give me a better shave than my old double blade, which didn\'t...well, you get the idea.  I remember my great uncle used a straight razor and honed the edge every day on a strop bolted to the side of the sink.  He would apply the foamy lather he mixed in a mug with a horsehair brush.  A splash of Clubman after shave completed the process.  It was a morning ritual that I doubt he would have given up ever.  He would have guffawed and rolled his eyes at me for falling for the notion that multiple blades are better than one.  He was a very smart man.

Maybe it\'s just my thick-haired mane, but these blades struggle to cut the keratin. I end up having to pull the blade harder, the blade gets dull faster, and my skin feels like a pawn caught between the two sides.In short: get the regular Fusion cartridges if you need to actually shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5614,1915,20111225,B003983HZK,1,"December 25, 2011",A14BCNFXHTRJ13,Wish I had read the negative reviews,"Yes, I am a woman, and yes, I use men\'s razors. They work better, last longer, etc etc. However these blades are nothing like the Gillette blades I love. The lubricant strip that usually leaves my legs feeling silky smooth is nonexistent on these blades, and instead of a smooth close shave I have a rough \'morning after\' feel. Sadly I wasted about $25 because I trusted Amazon (this was sold through Amazon itself not a third party).The look of the packaging is very similar to regular Gillette packaging, and the look of the blades themselves are close, but the lubricant strip (while colored and appearing normal) does not work as it does on Gillette blades, and the blades themselves do not give a good close shave as Gillette blades do.Maybe I got a bad batch, but according to some of the other reviews it seems as if this is an ongoing issue, so maybe they are right and this is a counterfeit item. Either way, that\'s the last time I buy razor heads through Amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m extremely particular about my razors; used to use Schick Extreme 3, which to my way of thinking were better than anything from Gillette, including the regular ProGlide. But these blades work better than anything I have ever used. Smooth, comfortable and close. The single blade on the back side makes trimming sideburns and around the nose very easy.

It is well known that Gillette\'s razors are designed to provide an excellent shave that doesn\'t last so that you have to buy more razors, these are no exception. I go through 8 razors per month, so it is nice that they are so cheap here. They are really good razors at first, and for me, the cost of replacing them frequently is worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standard fusion shaving cream does not compensate for the irritation and on about the 4th day of use does nothing to help in comfort or compensate for drag.  I used Aveeno facial soap as the shaving cream, it stoped the irritation and drag.  I also nearly doubled the blade life with the Aveeno face soap.They need to deep six the Fusion aftershave lotion...the stink is like a warning signal or call for help  ( as in; help, please pity me )",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I did not have issue with the regular Fusion razor blades, I was willing to to pay the increase to see if the Proguide treatment and design revisions improved things.  Alas, they do.  I was hoping they did not, so I could stock up on older original Fusion blades as they went on clearance. But I like the new Proguide blades and do think they perform better, so I guess no clearance deals for me.  At least I can save some money buying them from Amazon- so I have that working for me.

When the Proglide Power razor went on sale for less than a new Fusion cartridge would cost me, I decided to give it a try.  Yeah, that was a no brainer.  :)  I liked the shave, and I decided to stick with it for another eight cartridges when this package went on sale.In my opinion, these aren\'t a big advance over the Fusion Power.  In fact, it doesn\'t seem much if any different to me.  The Fusion Power worked very well, and so does this.  These give a clean shave with minimal effort, even when I recently went five or six days without shaving over vacation.I was disappointed when the bottom glide strip on my first Proglide cartridge came loose.  I have never had a problem with a Fusion Power cartridge.  The two Proglide cartridges since then have held up nicely, though, so I think/hope it was an anomaly.So, I recommend giving these a try if you\'re unhappy with your current razor.

This is possibly the best shave he has ever gotten, and it left his skin smooth as a baby\'s face, and in great condition.  The shave was close, smooth, and he actually enjoyed using the razor.

It fits nicely in the hand, it\'s got an interesting shape, and it does what it promised to do.

To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days and there was no appreciable difference.I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.  The battery power works in the shower, so that\'s a nice convenience.  Naturally, with a battery, there\'s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3.  Since my old razor never bothered me, I won\'t be switching to these more expensive blades.  But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I liked the old version, but the lubricating strip wore away after only 4 shaves and I experienced discomfort frequently while shaving.  I was a bit skeptical when this new Fusion ProGlide came out.  I mean, how much better could it be?  From the first stroke of the blade, I could feel the difference.  NO PAIN!  It was smooth, comfortable, and left a swath of stubble-free skin that didn\'t need an additional shaving.  I finished shaving and was VERY pleased, so much so that I look forward to my next shave which never happened with the old model.

The color of the handle is different from the Fusion and it comes with a now ubiquitous blue light to indicate that it is working - just in case you happen to fall asleep during shaving. The blade separation looks different and the hair trimmer is certainly easier to cleaner than previous incarnations of the five blade format. But the shaving process felt no different and the results were certainly no different to my present Fusion electric razor. So I put a new blade in the Fusion and did - to the extent possible - a subjective side by side comparison of the Proglide and the Fusion. They seemed the same to me.We all know that the Gillette - now P & G - consumer model is on the blade replacement rather than the razor - but this version of the 5-blade seems to lack sufficient advancement in the technology to provide a better shave, The New Yorker columnist,  Adam Gopnik, actually wrote a nice piece on the razor wars that can be found as \'Reflections, \'The Fifth Blade,\' The New Yorker, May 11, 2009, p. 50 [...]The Proglide would fit right in with Mr. Gopnik\'s conclusions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Admittedly, not the best practice, but its habit now for 20+ years and I\'m not changing.This is an excellent razor.  Shaves quick and clean, even \'against the grain\' on the sensitive areas like my upper lip.  No razor burn, not irritation.  The vibrating action of the blade really seems to help over the standard versions.  The non-vibrating blades, even the nicer ones, always leave razor burn if I shave against the grain, so I am forced to go with the grain even though it does not seem to be as close of a shave.  This blade allows me to shave the way I want to, without the irritation I get with other blades.Even has a cool blue light on the power button that lights up when its turned on, not sure what good its for as the razor vibrates so its hard to forget that its on, but its neat anyway.Blade refills are rather expensive, but that seems to be a fact of life now on all razors unless you choose to go with the one piece, single use type.I have used the same blade daily for about 2 weeks now, and it just started getting uncomfortable.  I can live with that.  For anyone who used shave gel or foam, you could probably go a bit longer.I can unconditionally recommend this blade.  After all, you probably shave every day, why not use something that is comfortable and fast?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gaudy styling...this is no Apple product! The battery...uh, what? Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...But, I needed a razor and the introductory price for the razor and blade is cheap and so I one-clicked it.Only had a day\'s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby and I didn\'t have to go over areas twice. Even glided smoothy and efficiently over the adams apple area. Battery on one side, unpowered on the other. Didn\'t notice a difference.Not a hard test, not enough for a review either, so I didn\'t shave for 4 or 5 days and tried it again. Non-powered on the right side, it was a dramatic improvement over previous multi-bladed shavers. Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better. Just a hair easier. It does help with a thick growth, not a noticeable difference to me with an overnight\'s worth. Of course, this will be different for everyone.Is the motor worth it? Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here. Would two or three blades work just as well? Not likely the cost would be much less, so what the heck, the more blades the better. Play with those blades. They really are very different than anything I have seen before.I really don\'t think I can get a better shave. A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly. I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don\'t take much time doing it. The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it. It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.The little trimmer blade works well.This is a highly recommended product, one that actually may make some difference in your life if shaving has been difficult for you.

When my whisker grows, it immediately starts to curl inward after it breaks the skin. It then grows back into the skin which causes the red irritation mark. He said this is actually quite common and sometimes called razor bumps, but it is really ingrown whiskers.If I go more than 48 hours without shaving - 2 things happen.  I start to see red bumps all over my neck and worse - more than 1 of them will bleed.After my latest bout with this issue I decided to give this baby a try.

I have tried--and rejected--several different Schick razors over the years simply because they were uncomfortable and left me feeling as though I had just shaved with broken glass using battery acid for shaving cream. I always went back to my Mach 3, then Fusion and was pleasantly surprised to see that the Fusion was being re-tooled to be even better.No matter HOW great my shaves have been using Gillette products, invariably I wince each & every time I go into a store to purchase replacement blades. Damn, but they\'re expensive! For some stupid reason, the times when I need a new razor the most seem to be at the moments when I can afford it the least. Weird, but a painful & expensive fact nevertheless.I swore off using Schick products shortly after the release of the Quattro model several years ago. I borrowed my brother-in-law\'s once and on a brand new blade, got a MUCH worse shave than I did using my 1 month old--not to mention rather dull and oft-used Gillette Mach 3 razor. After that I simply gave up even considering purchasing Schick products EVER again. I have always stuck with Gillette since--however, in all fairness I have discovered a 6 bladed razor that I have only found at Walgreens which shaves JUST AS GOOD as my Fusion--not to mention are cheaper (by at least $3 per refill), and would often stick with that in the last year or so when money has been tight.I finally saved up and purchased a Proglide razor recently and found the shave to be pretty much as expected. But as I began to take stock in all the models I have used over the years, I found something interesting...and I went and tested my theory to see if I was imagining it all--and nope, I was right on the money. The simple fact of the matter is this: all things considered, the Mach 3 razor shaves I would say about 98% as close as the Fusion 5 blade razor...and I aslo discovered that the Proglide does not shave ANY closer than the original Fusion. NONE. Considering how freakin\' expensive Gillette products are, and especially how much more they charge for the Proglide than the Fusion, I\'m sorry, but I would expect if the product cost 35% MORE, that the razor would actually perform 35% better, too. Not so. And when I factor in that the much cheaper Mach 3 shaves essentially as close as the other two MUCH more expensive razors, well I think you can figure out where I am going with this...I also discovered quite by accident, that Consumer Reports did their own independant testing and came up with the EXACT SAME results. Interesting, huh?I have one additional thing to add: through the amazon Vine program I received a Schick Hydro 5 razor back in early August. I only ordered it because I figured as long as I would be getting it for free, then at least if I did not like it, I could throw it away and not feel as though I had wasted any money. I was exceptionally surprised when after my first shave I had decided that I would go out and purchase a replacement cartridge right away. Yes, it was THAT good. From what I have noticed having used it now for over 2 months (still on the first original blade, too) is that the Hydro blades stay sharper MUCH longer than ANY previous Gillette product I have used in the past. Imagine my surprise when I went to purchase a replacement 4pack cartridge and discovered it was just under $5 cheaper than the regular Fusion 4pack and nearly $7 cheaper than the Proglides. In fact, it was about the exact same price as what I was paying for Mach 3 cartridges some 5 YEARS ago. Cheaper razors that last longer and still give me a top notch razor-burn-free shave adds up to one very converted former Gillette fanboy.To sum it up: did the Proglide shave great? YES. In fact it was a superior shave all around. Would I recommend buying one? Well, that depends. Personally I doubt I\'ll pay for another Proglide razor ever again. I simply cannot justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper. Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...but I found that for ME, the opposite was true. While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process. Either way, if you have the money, buy what works for YOU and don\'t let anybody tell you different.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I packaged up the entire original package as new, including the box, original receipt, and the cheesy complaint card you are entitled to write as per their refund guidelines. It cost me $12 to send all of this. Months later (seriously - like 2 1/2 months later!)they sent me back a letter & my receipt claiming that they cannot fulfill my request because I \'did not include the UPC code\'. The UPC code was on their packing!!! I sent it all back like new!!! More than they asked for!!!So - not only did I waste my time and an additional $12...but Gillette is wasting resources mailing this joke back to me...hence their costly product.I attribute this little event to Gilette not caring for my original review here on Amazon (below)...Hey America! Are why are we falling for this? Surely there are more of you who have noticed this disturbing trend of late?I am of Italian heritage with a heavy beard - I shave more whiskers in one stroke than most peach-fuzz Caucasians shave in a whole week...So if I don\'t need all these blades & tacky gimmicks - then no one does.All anyone requires is the original twin blade Sensor - loud, proud & simple. Easy to use with well-balanced quality. That was the Gillette I stuck with for many years. The Sensor was not impossibly wide/no annoying rubber fins/no vibrations/no batteries/no hype.This gimmicky, bulky, and overpriced nightmare fails to last any longer than a simple Sensor twin blade - here\'s why:The 5 blades here work well for the open expanse areas of the face...great. But they are way too wide to get at any tight spots like under your nose, upper lip, or any side-burn/mustache trimming. Gillette\'s solution is to flip over to a single trimming blade on the back. But here is where this entire concept fails: now we are down to the use & life of just this one blade!Get it?Once this one \'trimming\' blade is dull, the whole $3.00+ blade goes in the garbage!So really - it does not last any longer than a twin blade! With the old Sensor, we had the advantage of two blades hitting all the tight spots.And then there is this useless & goofy \'power\' business. So now, not only are we being forced to fork over $3.00+ per blade...but now we also have to start buying batteries. Gillette\'s stance on the environment? Well evidently their position is to now have millions more batteries going into our landfills. Lovely.And yes, Gillette is clearly bullying the marketplace as we longtime loyal customers can no longer find our favorites in the stores. And if we do - they are now priced double of what they were just a few short years ago. In fact, last time I found my Sensors at Walmart - there was a big sticker on the box asking the customer to call a 1-800 number to inform them if we \'see this product being sold elsewhere\'!! So much for competition and the free market economy!I remember everyone used to just go into the shaving aisle at the stores, grab their fave blades and leave. Now these aisles are full of price-shocked guys standing around scratching their heads, wondering what to do.OK, I understand that Gillette cannot effectively inventory all the retailers with every generation of product they ever made. I also believe in the evolution and optional availability of an evolved product. But give us the option of buying a simple twin blade at an affordable price and keep it readily available. But here Gillette has us over the barrel and is literally forcing everyone to pay a premium for what many of us do not believe is any better (in fact - annoyingly worse).If not, then I would say that this is an opportune time for the competition like Wilkinson Sword to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price. They would clean house. Unfortunately, I myself have not experimented much with the competition because of hit & miss availability. Don\'t want to find something one week - and then get stuck without the next. Hopefully that will now change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More blades, more power, and whatever else their powerful marketing machine is able to drum up.  However, coming from the standard Fusion line, I can\'t believe the difference this razor makes.  Maybe it\'s the vibration, maybe it IS the thinner blades, but whatever it is, it works.My beard is very coarse and grows like a caveman.  I can be completely smooth in the morning and by 7:00 at night, my face feels like sandpaper.  Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  The ProGlide is like butter.  Easily lumberjacking the thousands of mini pine trees that decorate my face.  This is my first experience with a \'powered\' razor.  I\'ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  Perhaps this is the reason the ProGlide feels to smooth.  Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  My face stays smooth ALL DAY.  I do have to shave the next morning, but if I wanted to, I could go into work (like I did today) with a minor sandpaper face.  However there is a cost for all of this handsomeness and it\'s the cost of those blades.  $3.30/each from Costco.  That\'s outrageous, but my wife does love a smooth face and I can\'t deny her that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I usually got 2 weeks from the regular but only got about 10 days with the proglide.  Reason I can\'t be sure is I skipped shaving and it had to deal with a 2 day growth twice and that may have \'shortened\' the use.  I just wish I could find a razor that was more economical.  I had gone electric but suffered from irritation and when you figure the purchase plus the 2x a year blade replacement (yes electrics need blade replacement too) the cost came out the same.  When the 5 blade razor first appeared a news story did a comparision with the 3 blade.  There was no noticeable difference in the quality of shave that the review panel could feel.

I\'ve also read reports from anonymous Gillette factory employees hinting that the refill razors are of lower quality than the blades included in the complete razor package.  I guess the goal it to impress you with the starter pack with a comfortable shave and blades that last weeks, then make the money off you with the pricey refills of lower quality that require more frequent replacement.  I don\'t know whether this is evidence of that theory, or if these blades are not authentic.Either way, I was not impressed with these blades.

It costs about $9. The Gillette Mach3 Cartridges , 8 cartridges cost about $10. Now I\'ve tried this Gillette Fusion Power razor at a cost of about $12 with Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges, 8-Count Package costing about $20.For the extra $3 for the razor, it cannot be beat. Gillette has raised its own bar for excellent shaving. This razor has five blades instead of three, guaranteeing the closest possible shave with several cool features. The blue lubricating strip turns white when the blade reaches the end of its use. It comes with a AAA battery that fits in the ergonomically slip-free grip handle (with a low battery light indicator). This vibrates the five blades at a high rate to ensure a very close shave. The microchip in the handle turns the razor off after eight minutes. Plus, on the back side there is a `precision trimmer\' blade that cuts those sideburns exact and is gentle enough to trim around your moustache, goatee and nose. Gillette claims each disposable blade will last up to a month, but I have found Gillette blades (the three blade version) to last three weeks. So I expect this five blade version to last well past a month. That\'s amazing.The Gillette Fusion handle costs $3 more and the refills (8) cost $10 more, but they last longer and the shave is so much closer. Spend the few extra dollars and get a razor with blades that last longer than any other on the market. I suggest buying in bulk to save money.

This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90% of the replacement blades, I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop (presumably glue) all over the blade, with the single blade missing! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems, as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet, and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality. I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke, but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades, I think it\'s time to call a spade a spade. I shave my head and my face both, and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors, and even with a fresh blade, many times it feels as though I\'m shaving my face/head with a sharp rock. needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am currently a Mach 3 user and I love it so I wondered if this Fusion thing would make a big difference.  I honestly feel that the shave with the Fusion is of the same closeness at the Mach 3.  However the Fusion has a HUGE bonus the extra blade (six) on the back of the shaving headto hit those stray hairs that remain under the nose that the Mach 3 normally misses.  Also it is much easier to trim sideburns with the Fusion because you do not have to worry about hacking off a huge chunk with the mass of 3 blades with the Mach 3.  A bit pricey and if the razor came at the same price as the Mach 3 I would commit to the upgrade, (Very Hard for guys to change hygeine products, we love the good old reliables).  If you do not have a Mach 3 then I recommend purchasing the Fusion.  Bottom line: Close shave, nice sideburn and stray hair trimmer, nice overall design of the handle, and a good looking razor.

They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion Power blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else.

It\'s triple blade design seems like overkill, I mean really, I can get just as close of shaves with a classic DE safety razor, and have less razor burn. If you haven\'t learned already, more blades dragging across the surface of the skin means increased chance for razor burn, it\'s just that simple. So while this razor is less prone to give razor burn than the 4 and 5 blade designs, it\'s still going to be worse than a 2 or single blade design. We\'re talking about human body hair here, we\'re not using it to shave an angora rabbit.The 3 blades are spaced well enough apart that they don\'t easily clog, and rinse very easily. The handle is nicely contoured and easy to hold without slippage at most any angle, and is textured enough not to be slippery when all soapy. Speaking of soapy, those little goo-bars on the razor are awful. They turn to slime, clear slime like when you blow your nose with a bad head-cold. It\'s just stringy and disgusting looking. They also do little to help the blades glide over wet skin. I ended up with the worst razor burn I\'ve ever had by trying to use this razor on wet skin. Once I went back to foaming up my legs with a super-slick tallow shaving soap, I was able to get irritation free shaves.The little goo bars don\'t last past 4 shaves for me before they\'re gone. They don\'t last nearly as long as the blades stay sharp. Cost-wise I\'m not thrilled either, with the price of the cartridge refills. Once these cartridges are depleted I\'ll be happily going back to my M&Uuml;HLE R89 razor with Gillette 7 O\'Clock SharpEdge blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new holder is MUCH smaller and suctions to the wall. You just slide the neck of the razor into the holder, and that\'s it. I\'m not sure why they changed this. I would think wall space in the shower isn\'t really something most people are trying save, and now, your spare razor heads have to be kept outside of the shower. To some this may not be a big deal, but I ALWAYS change to a new razor head while I\'m in the shower.Overall, I still love the razor and the job it does, but the new holder design is, IMO, no good.

They\'re not perfect, but they\'re the best that I\'ve found.  When I saw this new Venus Pro Skin, I decided to give it a try because it\'s actually cheaper than buying a new pack of blades (less blades, so more per blade, but cheaper overall) and you get a new handle with it, which is always nice because the handles can get dirty over time.The box opened astonishingly easy.  No scissors required.  This handle is a little bit longer and has more of an angle to it than other handles in the Venus series.  I thought that was nice.  The see-through light blue color was very pretty too.  Compared to my old Venus, this razor looked sleek and shiny.  I become more skeptical when I examined the new razor heads, though. The razor is surrounded by two gel pads.  There\'s nothing backing them, no plastic holding them on.  They move easily up and down as you touch them.  I\'ve had experience with some of these in-head shaving gel products before and have found that they usually completely fall apart or all of the lotion/gel is gone in about two shaves, when of course the razors should last much longer than that.Using the razor I found that it felt very nice on my skin.  I could tell the gel was helping lubricate the skin, but it wasn\'t overly sudsy.  However large strings of gel kept coming off the razor.  This was a little bit gross.  Also the head was too large to fit into tight curves and made it really hard to shave certain spots.  As I expected, one shave used about half of the gel pad, which is a big disappointment.The big test for me is after I get out of the shower, though.  For the first time in ages I didn\'t have any nicks from shaving with a new blade!  I always dread switching blades because I always get cut up.  Also my legs didn\'t itch.  I frequently have trouble with razor burn and itching, and this product actually solved that for me when nothing else has.So where does that leave me?  This product worked wonders for protecting my skin when nothing else has.  I love it for that reason alone.  But the gel pad isn\'t going to last more than a few shaves, which would mean that I\'d have to buy a new head every few days.  That would be ridiculously expensive, but honestly maybe worth it considering how much I do suffer from razor burn normally.  I think if you have problems with razor burn, you should give this product a try.  If you\'re looking for a new handle for the Venus, this one is very pretty.  But if you\'re happy with your current shaving gel routine, these gel pads are bulky and won\'t last hardly any time at all.  For those people, I think this product is a waste of money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zellers was the only store that had them in stock, I could only assume the other more popular places like, Walmart and Shoppers Drug Mart were all sold out.At that time I had a chin strap with messy stubble on my neck and cheeks. So it was a perfect time to fix up my style.So I started with the trimmer, I love the feeling of the product, despite how cheap it cost, it surly does NOT feel cheap. The combs are easy to clip on and off. I used a size 2 to trim my chin strap down and looked great. The only downside i found with the trimmer is the numerous times i had to run thru the hair to make sure i got everything, I still ended up missing a few. Also the width is quite narrow but nothing to disappointing. Then i removed the comb and used the trimmer to line up my chin strap to easily shave around it, but it doesnt seem to trim close enough to do a line up.I moved on to the razor, I shaved around my chin strap, i love how smooth it glides across my face, but the shave was not very close as the disposable razors i was using before this. I had to go over a few times, still had missed spots and even going over that, it leaves a layer of very short stubble, no matter how often i go over it. Mind you i went with the grain, not against it. UPDATE: i tried shaving again, this time i applied more pressure to the device which did end up shaving alot closer but caused a bit of irratation on my neck. Its also not as smooth as it was the first time around, not sure why.Then i used the precision edging blade to finish off my style, used it around my strap to give it a final line up, didnt seem like it was doing much aswell, I had to shave the area a few times to actually get the left over stubble from the razor. I\'m unsure if its the product or i was unfortunate to have picked up a faulty one with a dull razor :\. So i plan on buying a pack of cartridges and i\'ll give this another go.So over all i\'m giving this a 3/5 for now, i will edit and update the info untill i give it another shot.UPDATE: Gave this item a second shot, in all honesty i like the product just because it does what it says it does. Don\'t expect a powerful device, considering its powered by a single battery. But its exceptional for the price, small, easy to storage, nice look and feel. Easy to maneuver. Its worth giving a shot. Im sure since this product was such a success, with all the positive feedback ive read through out numerous sites, they\'ll try to create a much better one in the near future.. at least i hope they do, cuz i\'ll def. be looking out for that one.  end result 4/5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6486,2801,20120314,B0062IWQVU,4,"March 14, 2012",A2FS81TQQXWZYB,"The perfect shaver and trimmer, but only good for the face...","I bought the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler after seeing it was supposed to be a great tool for facial hair detailing and lining.  And after owning it for a month or two now, it\'s definately a good trimmer to be battery powered, but not great as it is advertised.  First I\'ll list the pros...ProsGreat for shaving-With the fusion proglide heads, this razor is awesome.  It has the same quality, but better since it has the higher quality handle.  I threw away my old proglide handle in favor of this sleeker and more efficent design.  As far as the face shaving aspect of this product, it\'s excellent.Great for trimming your facial hair-Another aspect where the Styler is excellent.  I\'ve used it to trim my goatee and sideburns quite a few times, and it gives an even and effective trim.  Plus, it\'s the original reason I bought the Styler, since my Phillips Norelco beard trimmer cut and trimmed my facial hair unevenly.  With this though, trimming is very fast and simple.  I also like how the trimmer comes with three length combs, making it easy when I decide to grow a beard and blend my goatee with interchangable trimmer combs.  When trimming my goatee, I used the 3 guide comb, which is perfect for trimming the length on shaggy hair without completely oblitterating my goatee.  Then, when I wanna grow my beard out, I used the 1 guide comb to blend my goatee in with my stubble.The razor comes complete with a stand to hold everything-I couldn\'t believe for $20, I got a razor/trimmer/attachment combs/tray.  The tray that comes inside the packaging means your bathroom will be more organized than using traditional razors or trimmers.  It\'s also smart the way the tray has 3 openings in the back for each guide comb and one opening in the top for the fusion head attachment to rest in.  And the fusion attachment head is built efficently, since it has an attachment that fits neatly on top of the trimmer head.  It also looks cooler and makes storage easy and effective.Now onto the cons...ConsNot great for lining facial hair-While this trimmer is perfect for trimming facial hair and shaving, it\'s not great at lining a beard, sideburns or goatee.  This actually surprized me, since the Gillette campaign in the advertisements claims it\'s great for lining and detailing.  Specifically showing in the commercials how supposedly great it is in detailing and lining facial hair.  In that department, it\'s a bit of a disappointment, but I\'ve never found any cartridge razor that can line as well as a disposable razor, and this is no exception.  And as far as the edger is concerned, the few times I\'ve tried lining with it, it never did a phenominal job, more like mediocre at best, since in most instances I wound up using a disposable razor to correct it.Doesn\'t have a long battery life-Not really too surprizing here, since I\'m kind of OCD when it comes to keeping my facial hair looking neat.  Plus, I have used it more often than just on my face, thus a partial reason why the battery isn\'t lasting very long.  I\'d say the average battery life of the Styler would be a month if not used for body hair or any other non facial detailing purpose.  Since it\'s so efficent though, this isn\'t a major issue for me.  Others might see it that way however, since batteries are kind of costly to replace.Not great for use on body hair or lining the back of your neck-I really don\'t consider these two areas major issues, since the Styler is only intended for face use anyway.  I feel though that I must point out for those who think this might be great for trimming body hair or good for lining your neck in between barber visits, this isn\'t the tool for either purpose.  With this being a battery controlled trimmer, it\'d take you forever to use on body hair.  Plus, to me using something on your body hair that\'s intended for your face is kind of cross contaminating anyway.  I initially thought I might be able to use this for lining my neck hair in between trims, but this won\'t leave an even cut or line.  Something my old beard trimmer could do, but again not a big deal to me, since this product is for facial shaving and maintenance.Overall, I rate this 4 out of 5 stars since it\'s great at shaving and trimming facial hair.  Really, for about $20 bucks, this Styler is a quality invcstment for any guy.  It can do most things a beard trimmer can at half the cost(not counting the cheapo pieces of crap trimmers).  I wish this thing was rechargable, then it would be darn near perfect.  If you\'re expecting to be using this for any other purpose than facial hair, you might want to invest in a good body hair trimmer or hair clipper set instead.  Otherwise though, I have been happy with this purchase and would buy another set once it needed replacing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6512,2827,20120205,B0062IWQVU,2,"February 5, 2012",APTW8DVRUKIEN,Not the best shave and expensive.,"This will not give you the best shave you can get.  As is with multi-bladed cartridges, you will get skin irritation, ingrown hairs and spend too much money on replacement cartridges.  The best shave is with \'Traditional Shaving\'.  Its what was invented over 100 years ago and pre-dated razor blade cartridges.  Better, closer shaves and much cheaper.  Inexpensive razor blades call \'DE\' or double edge razor blades.  Why spend $4.00 per razor cartidge when you can spen as little as $.015 per DE razor blade!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It works as advertised has 3 connectors for different lengths, 4 if you count the one when not using the connector. I haven\'t used the blade yet. I have a beard and this thing works. I haven\'t used many but for the price I don\'t see why you would need to try any others when this one works at 17$. Highly recommend. If you count it as a con the only one would be it uses AA battery so just make sure you keep a few extra around.

6515,2830,20120129,B0062IWQVU,5,"January 29, 2012",A2JLQBD9IDT5QV,"The perfect daily groomer for your beard, and your hair","I picked up one of these at the local drug store last night after having a coupon to get $3 off. I had a similar styler, but the blades were dull and a pain to groom myself with. It\'s quick, fast and easy to use, helping you to always look your best with all your quick grooming needs.For as cheap as the Gillette styler was, it sure is my new favorite tool to groom with! It\'s got a lot of nice features that more expensive stylers have, but for around only $20, plus it\'s water proof for use in the shower! First off let\'s start with the fact that it uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges, how amazing is that? I can now toss out my old fusion power pro-glide handle since this one works even better. The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates just as well, if not better than the standard power handles on the disposable shavers.The handle is nicely molded, very clean look and provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not hard plastic, so you won\'t find yourself dropping the styler or having it slip out of your palms. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding.You can use the standard motorized blade directly on your skin without worrying about cutting yourself, or scratching up your skin. It\'s sharp, but only for your hair. It also includes 3 different style \'combs\' to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you\'d want to trim. With all these little plastic attachments here and there though, you\'ll need a place to store it all! Gillette is two steps ahead of you, because the packing it comes in also doubles as a stand and accessory holder for the styler itself, and all the little attachments included.One nice thing not many shavers or stylers have is the ability to open the compartment behind the blade to clean out hair that can cause jams. The Gillette styler has a hatch you can pop off, and snap right back down to clean out any hair or gunk so your styler never jams, and will always work reliably. This is a huge plus for me since my old one was becoming weak and dull from all the hair trapped in the mechanism slowing down the blade and motor.Besides the styler and the accessories, I received Gillette brand cooling lotion to use after shaving, and non burning shaving gel. I tried both, and liked them very much. The shaving gel made my hairs pirk right up after a few seconds, making shaving so much easier. I felt no burn or sting while using the gel, so it really does work. Afterwards I put some of the lotion into my palms and rubbed it onto my face where I had shaved, it did have a nice cooling effect, but I could have lived without the lotion, it has a nice light scent to it too.For under $20, the Gillette Styler really can\'t be beat. It\'s cheap in price, high quality, comes with tons of accessories and samples, and it does a good job. It would make a great gift to any guy you know, or a gift to yourself!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
