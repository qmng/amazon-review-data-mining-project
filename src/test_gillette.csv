When new, they give a very nice clean, smooth, and even shave on your face.After that, it\'s a MAJOR pain to clean out the whiskers that get caught between the triple blades.  I had to spend 10 minutes shaking the razor in both standing and running water to clean it out.  Now when you\'re up in the morning trying to get ready for work, you don\'t have that kind of time to spare cleaning a razor.Problem is, if you don\'t clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.Also, even after cleaning, it doesn\'t last very long at all.  On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &quot;indicator strip&quot; sooner.I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem.",,,,

31,32,20110818,B000052YHS,5,"August 18, 2011",A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,"Fast, effective, stupid-proof","The reason to buy this razor is so you won\'t have to think about shaving. There\'s no special technique, it\'s easy to clean, and it\'s disinclined to cut you. It doesn\'t feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I\'m using the same handle, and I\'ve since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can\'t feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don\'t reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won\'t fare as well. I\'ve bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.I\'ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it\'s difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it\'s been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge. Nitpicking, really.A safety razor would probably give you a closer cut, but if shaving is something you dispense with rather than an event to relish, the Mach 3 is where it\'s at.",,,,

The Mach3 is the best yet, though I have yet to try the new Fusion razor.Gillette makes all sorts of claims regarding the Mach3.  I am unable to tell whether any of the claims have merit.  I can tell you that the blades, though expensive, last a long time for me.  I have moderately tough facial hair.  The old disposable razors gave me a few days of shaving and they were history.  I have shaved up to two months with these razors and still got a good shave.I have read that there are controversies about the value of three blades.  I think the three blades help keep the razor at the optimum angle on my face for shaving.  I do get a pretty good shave as well.  I do use Edge Advanced Shave Gel in combination with my Gillette Mach3, which may help get me a better shave.Most men in the United States shave, whether we like it or not.  The Gillette Mach3 gives me the best and most consistent shave I have ever had.  Until I find a better razor, the Mach3 is the one for me.Enjoy!",,,,

All types of mach 3\'s produce an equal shave which is at the same time, close and the blades clean out well under a hot tap. but the overriding factor that made me come back to them was the 7 variaties of handle to choose from, so now i can have a different razor for every day of the week which overall makes shaving everyday more tolerable. i dont personally believe in the micro-pulses of the m3 power but the vibrations themselves must enhance the the performance somehow. if your thinking of buying one of the mach 3\'s then go for it, as you won\'t be dissapointed.",,,,

I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much closer and easier it shaved compared to the gels. I tried brand B foam later and it seemed to be more air less moisture. The Gillete product does come out less puffed up, which is due, I\'m speculating, to a higher moisture content. So the Gillette Foam is now my daily shave product.",,,,

The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they didn\'t even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs.

The price differance is not much worse, if you buy the new razors online at Amazon. The handle on this thing has much more style, and is a lot more attractive than the sensor 3 and really has a nice precise feel, in your hand. It shaves incredibly close, and does an excellent job, going againest the grain! You look forward to shaving, which is something that never happened before. And you feel like a million bucks when you are done! I have already ordered a champion one with the red and black color scheme, because I\'m a Chicago Bulls fan. My opinion, this is prabably the best bang for buck on the market. The other systems with more blades and even fancier designs are WAY to expensive, unless you are just looking to toss money away!

217,225,20090316,B0001LQGEM,3,"March 16, 2009",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,Average performance,"After using this razor for a short period of time, I feel compelled to tell others how it stacks up in the world of razors. With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one. The cartridges are still available in some stores, however. This review specifically covers the Sensor3 cartridge system.Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor3. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Sensor3 cartridges are noticeably smaller than the Mach 3 cartridges, by comparison. The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.The shave: 3 stars. I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving. I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days\' facial hair growth. The angle of the blade takes some getting used to. I noticed several times that I placed the blade on my face at the wrong angle, presumably because of my adjustment to the Mach 3/Fusion/Quattro razors which seem to have a more linear handle design. The biggest problem I encountered were several cuts. Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors. I do note that the shave was close, but comfort was lacking.Durability: 3 stars. This is the durability rating I give to the Sensor3 disposables. I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges. Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.Overall: The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable). For razor systems, one would be advised to choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.",,,,

It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.",,,,

Shaving\'s about as pleasurable as a molten lava enema.  Fortunately, the right products can make it a little more bearable.  I\'ve never anticipated the release of a shaving product of any kind before, but this razor got me really intrigued.  Could this be the razor that conquers my impossible face (and wallet) once and for all?Gillette have been the masters of shaving comfort for several years now.  Their introduction of the Mach 3 razor was a breakthrough, just like they said.  A lot of you likely still use the Mach 3, but it\'s a good bet the Fusion will make you want to upgrade.I\'ll admit, I was a little wary about using a five-bladed razor.  I felt the same way about the Mach 3; I envisioned pressing too hard and slicing into my jugular, or worse, going to work with an entire roll of toilet paper on my face.  Thankfully, the opposite happened, and I used the Mach 3 and M3 Turbo for years.  I even bought into the M3 Power when it came out, but found there wasn\'t much difference in closeness or comfort (which is why I chose the manual Fusion over the Fusion Power).  Still a really good shave, though.Anyway, about the Fusion.  First off, don\'t be intimidated by the five blades.  They\'re close enough together that you really have to try to cut yourself.  In fact, that\'s one of the beauties of this razor.  Even a face like mine, which is very susceptible to cuts, accepted the Fusion\'s blades with very little irritation.  The first couple of times I used it, I had to watch out for pressing too hard and suffered a couple minor nicks, but I quickly got the hang of it.  The blades really do all the work.  The head of the razor is bigger than the M3 as well, which actually does cut down on shaving time.I\'ve always liked the \'indicator\' strip on the top of the M3 blade that lets me know when it\'s time to change the blade, and it\'s here on the Fusion as well.  It\'s made with aloe, if you\'re interested in that sort of thing, which supposedly aids in shaving comfort.  You\'ll get about a week\'s worth of good shaves before the blade wears out, which works out to a pack of cartridges a month (about the same as the M3).  It\'s best to pick these up in bulk (packs of 8); if and when you switch to this razor, you\'ll need them anyway, and you\'ll save a little dough in the process.The extra blade on the back of the razor is rather neat indeed.  It does help even out your sideburns and touches up those tricky spots right under your nose and above your chin.  I wouldn\'t use it for beard sculpting or anything, but for tough areas it does a good job.  Just be mindful of that blade when you\'re shaving near your ears.  I accidentally nicked my earlobe shaving my jawline the first time I used it. Yeowch!Changing the blade out is just as easy as the M3 also.  Just pop, slide, and click a new blade in.The \'comfort guard\' under the main blades is a slight improvement from the M3, but it\'s not really a \'wow\' factor.  The \'ergonomic\' handle is pure gimmick; it does little more than make the Fusion look like a phaser from Star Trek.  I would rather just buy the blades and have them fit on my Mach 3, but what kind of marketing savvy would that be?  Oh well; the razor itself isn\'t exactly a bank-breaker, and you only have to buy it once.All told, this is the Porsche 911 of razors.  It\'s a smooth ride, it\'s comfortable, it\'s fast, and yes, even though the blades are pricey, it\'s worth it to me.  If I had my druthers, of course, I\'d use an electric (they\'re much less expensive in the long run), but they\'re just not compatible with my face and Rocky Mountain-ish peaks and valleys of my neck.  (Believe me; I\'ve tried five different kinds.)  The Fusion\'s the closest shave I\'ve gotten with a blade yet.  If you really saw the difference between the M3 and M3 Power on your face, you\'ll probably notice it with the Fusion Power as well, but I figure I\'m paying enough for the one without the motor.I\'m glad I made the switch, and after comparing with the Mach 3, I won\'t go back.

The problem with this blade (and also the Quattro, and also to some degree the 3 bladed razors) is that because the blades are so close together, the cut hair gets stuck between the blades more easilly.  This requires more time rinsing between strokes, so it overall doesn\'t save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive, so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it\'s important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades (compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel) helps in shaving large parts of skin, like legs or whatever.  But when it\'s your face with its nooks and crannys, I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort. The 6th blade feature was OK, but didn\'t feel like it was worth it.Remember, that with any NEW blade, you will get an awesome shave.  People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it, because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they\'re reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit----Recently got this as a gift.  Same problems as listed before.  I\'ll just use it until I run out of blades.",,,,

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,

I\'m done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave.  Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other \'detail\' parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front.  It just doesn\'t work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use.",,,,

During that deployment, I managed to use the same blade for 20+ days at a time. Did I mention I also shaved my scalp with the same blade....? Since my return home at the end of 2007, I\'ve been getting a month\'s use per blade on both my face and scalp. I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but, what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long? On the 1st of each month, I replace the old blade with a fresh one. The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months.... You have to admit, that\'s money well spent.I\'ve used all types of blades starting when I was 15...single, double, triple edge blades...Electric shavers, clippers, and even depilatories(which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it, spread it on, wait for it to cure, scrape it off, and wash the excess off my face). I\'ve never had a razor blade that shaved me so close, for so long.To close this review I\'d like to add that I\'ve been on Active Duty in the U.S. Army for 24 years, 7 months & 21 days now and will retire in 41 days (June 30th).

508,518,20100714,B000BUUVTE,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,

Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn\'t waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3\'s were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I\'ve had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an \'upgrade\' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you\'re handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, \'What were they thinking?!\' crosses my mind.  I\'ve discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3.

Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself.

It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It\'s now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it\'s thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers,  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.

Some have thick fast-growing hair, some thin slow-growing, some medium thickness fast growing, etc. Everyone\'s different. Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don\'t need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it\'s what works for them.So far, these Fusion Power\'s are the best for me. My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors. The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3\'s came out, and the Mach3\'s were equally tossed when the Fusion Power\'s arrived. The reason - the 2 blades hurt, I cut myself lots, and wore out in one or two uses. Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut. These Power Fusions However, I must emphasize: *have yet to cut me*. I think the vibrate function is to thank for this, but I\'ve yet to cut myself when the battery runs out either, so it may just be the blade.Here\'s what Gillette does not want you to know though: these things last a LONG time. You can use one blade for months with minimal degradation of the blade quality, as long as you use the vibrate function and cream. How do I know they don\'t want you to know this? Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they\'d like, and so there\'s a whole marketing bend they\'re on about checking your indicator strips to see if it\'s time to replace. My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn\'t as quickly disposable.That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me. No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I\'m barely buying one pack a year.",,,,

I\'m not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick.  I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it.  Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out.  I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades.

I have been using Gillette sensor-series products almost exclusively since the Gillette sensor debuted in 1990.I graduated from Sensor, To Sensor II, to Mach 3, to Mach 3 power.I normally shave wet, with no shaving cream, and with down strokes, although I use some upstrokes. I have tested the Mach 5 both wet and dry, with no cuts or major problems.I have used the Gillette Fusion for 1 week, and here are my findings.Pluses:1) An overall great shave.2) The Fusion shaves better dry than any previous Sensor model. (Although I rarely have a reason to shave dry).3) More blades. More microfins!4) The plastic handle, while bulky, is very nice. The plastic is gentle to the touch, aa nice departure from the rigid, cold metal of the M3.5) Comes with a coupon for $2 off additional cartridges.Minuses:1) The confort strip wear out WAY too quickly.  My Mach3 blades last 3 weeks, My Fusion blade needs replacement after 1 week. Hopefully, the replacement blades will be better than the original ones (if so, I\'ll edit this review).2) Since there are more microfins with a larger area, and sincen the microfins become more imporant to the overall shave, the microfins trap more hairs than ever. Even washing the blade doesn\'t get rid of all of the microhairs trapped in the microfins.3) The 5 blades make upstrokes more difficult and don\'t offer the precision of the M3 and previous models for the tough spots (e.g. under the nose). On the soft ares of the face (e.g., the cheecks), the larger footprint makes it harder to press close and cut hairs close to the skin. However, this problem is somewhat offset by the additional blades and microfins.4) As always, the blades are more expensive than previous version. At this rate of inflation, Gillette blades will cost $50 each by the year 2030. =)Overall, it is a great product. I am undecided if I will keep using Fusion or switch back to the M3 as my primary. I might use both together (as I previously did with the M3 and Sensor Excel).",,,,

I purchased a M3 Power razor about a year ago and had little complaint with it, the biggest complaint I had was that the button on the handle was in a bad position, mainly the space that I like to grip the handle.Unfortunately, it seems, the new generation of Gillette suffers from even more problems than the previous generation. The button is still in that same godforsaken place. On top of that, the downstroke, or rather, the stroke with the grain is almost completely worthless. I will admit, it didn\'t grab the stubble or tear at my face, and it was a smooth stroke, exactly like the previous generation, but it left a horrendous amount of stubble. The cause of this I believe to be the huge blue buffer pad on the bottom edge of the blade. Even the new blade on the back end of the razor is practically useless. It cuts even worse than the ones on the front.The only positive thing I can say about this is the redesign of the handle. Unlike the M3 Power, you can use your index finger up higher on the handle if you so choose to but your continuously pressing against it and bumping the button.My conclusion would have to be that this is a subpar razor for a radically outragous price. $14 for the Razor, $14 for 4 replacements, and $30+ after tax for 8 replacements. It seems like Gillette was more concerned about getting as much money out of your pockets as they could than they were about designing a better razor. I will be returning to using the M3 Power, if only to save myself time whilst shaving.",,,,

There is absolutely no way this is a 4- or 5-star product. I call shill.I\'ll start with the few good things about the razor:1. It feels very nice in hand. The \'grippies\' are in just the right place. It has a nice heft with the battery in. The size and shape fit the hand nicely.2. It looks very cool. I really like the orange and grey/silver meme that has been going through design the past few years. If anyone watches you shave, they will be impressed seeing you with this. However, I, for one, typically shave alone so this isn\'t worth much.3. The battery level indicator is very cool and effective. It\'s hard to describe, but I wish everything I own that uses batteries had this indicator.4. The single blade on the back of the razor is brilliant. It\'s not as effective as I\'d like, but it is much better at keeping a sharp sideburn line than the five blades. I suspect the angle/ position will be worked out in the future.Now the bad:1. It doesn\'t shave any better than any other razor I\'ve ever used. Yeah, it gives a pretty close shave. But my tried and true Sensor Excel blades, the handle of which I purchased in 1996, give just as close of a shave without any of the other problems listed below.2. It\'s very expensive. $30 for 8 cartridges?! Ridiculous. Absolutely not worth it. The Sensor Excel 8 pack is literally half the price - still more than I think they are worth - but gives a better shave.3. I\'ve never had a more uncomfortable shave. The blades catch my stubble, making for a very slow shave. Yes, of course, shaving with the \'grain\' of your beard reduces this problem but it still happens. Most people have swirling grain somewhere on their face. This razor makes shaving those areas very difficult and slow going.4. The blades have a short lifespan. I am only able to get 3-4 shaves out of a head before the stubble-catching problem gets so bad I can\'t use it. By contrast, my Sensor Excel blades easily last 7-8 shaves - about two weeks, though by the 7th or 8th shave it is catching pretty bad too. My straight edge doesn\'t have this problem at all, given a quick run over the strop before each shave.The overall experience is expensive and uncomfortable and results in a mediocre shave. It is a disappointing product and not worth the investment.",,,,

While I was impressed with the Mach 3, and more so with the Mach 3 Turbo, when I switched to the Quattro, I knew that was the razor for me. Close shave, smooth glide, rarely any cuts at all even on my difficult-to-shave face. Recently when I went to the store, they were out of the 4-pack of Quattro blades, and so instead of buying an 8-pack, I decided to try this brand new razor from Gillette. I\'d never had a 5-blade razor before (let alone a battery-powered vibrating one) and so I decided to go all out, even though I was very disappointed to find that the cartridges cost $3.50 EACH.It comes in a nice easy-to-open clamshell package with a cheesy-looking but convenient holder that can either lay flat or stand vertically, which is what I prefer. It comes with a battery, which was very easy to install, and is touted as being shower-proof. I wouldn\'t know, because I don\'t shave in the shower.The vibration was not at all what I was expecting. I don\'t really know what I was expecting since this was my first powered razor, but when they say \'gentle micro-pulses\' I think of a soft intermittent buzz. Not so. This razor is strong, and it vibrates like a cell phone, constantly, insistently and very noticably. I was surprised by how strong the vibration was for a small appliance.I used my standard Gillette foam shave cream, and set to work trimming my face. The first thing I noticed is that I couldn\'t really feel the razor on my face as it vibrated and shaved my whiskers. The second thing I noticed is that I also couldn\'t feel when my face was clean-shaven while the razor was vibrating. I rely on the way the razor feels and sounds on my skin to know when I\'m done shaving a spot, and the vibration drowned out any noise or sensation or any other feedback I might have gotten from the razor. However, it didn\'t make that much of a difference, because I had to go over the same spots four or five times in order to make them clean-shaven. I\'m not sure what the 5th blade is doing, but I don\'t have to shave the same spots that many times with even an old blade on my Quattro. However, when I was done, the final result was a pretty good shave, with a few nicks here and there--the Fusion doesn\'t work well with bumps on the face when vibrating.I also used the single trimmer blade on my sideburns. It seems to work as advertised, and it is easy to use for accurate trimming of the sideburns. The problem, however, is that the single-blade end is no good for shaving a larger area such as your entire moustache, but the five-blade side is way too large for such a task. I found it very awkward to shave my moustache area with either end.Bottom line: I will be returning the Fusion and exchanging it for a set of replacement cartridges for my Quattro. It still outperforms the Fusion in spite of having one less blade in the area of comfort and shaving sensation, and the cartridges are $1.50 cheaper each. I may go back to the Fusion sometime, but if I did, it would be the manual version, never the vibrating version. This was my first and last experience with a battery-powered razor.",,,,

I have pretty thick facial hair, though it is not especially fast-growing (no big problems with five o\'clock shadow and I only shave every two or three days - though on day three, I\'m pretty grizzled). The Fusion gave me the closest shave ever - especially on my neck around the Adam\'s apple, which is an always-difficult area. I usually find a few stray stubbles, even with my Mach3 Power that I\'ve been happily using for quite some time, but today my neck was smooth and clean with no \'re-do\'.The five blades of the Fusion are closer together and thus occupy about the same amount of space as the three blades of the Mach 3.  This results in a very smooth feel to the shave - you don\'t feel the five separate blades, just one shaving surface.  I did feel some tugging on the heaviest parts of my beard (I hadn\'t shaved since Sunday morning).I also found I didn\'t need to go back to \'re-shave\' certain areas.  My facial hair is pretty dense and there are certain spots on my upper cheeks, directly under my jaw and on my neck that I tend to miss or just don\'t get a close shave on the first go-round.  This wasn\'t a problem with the Fusion.The extra sixth blade works exactly as described and is a fantastic addition.  I was able to easily (and accurately) straighten out my sideburns and get those few stray and hard-to-get-at hairs under and next to my nose.Overall, I\'m very impressed.  I recognize that there is a certain amount of hype surrounding new introductions from Gillette - but it seems like they really do their homework.  When they first came out with Mach3 Power, it seemed like a gimmick - but I found it gave me a closer and more comfortable shave.  Now, with the Fusion, it feels like another leap forward in shaving technology...  I\'m sold and give the Fusion Power my unqualified recommendation.",,,,

I hated shaving every other day as I found the shave quite uncomfortable. But with my ever increasing stubble, I wanted to find an alternative.I found this one at Kroeger and decided to give it a try. I was very impressed with the shave, it was very smooth and much more comfortable than any two blade razor. What was most impressive was it cut far less than the other razors. The turbo option doesnt really improve the shaving experience though and so I shave without the turbo power. I do have to shave on the same spots again but I do not feel any discomfort as compared to the other razors. The trimming blade too is useful especially when working on the sideburns and underneath the neck, but it takes some time to figure out the \'correct\' way of holding the handle in this position.But alas, all good things have a price and this one might be too expensive in the long run. I will have to see how many shaves my blades last to get the economics right.In short, if you are still stuck with two blades and want to move to better options, I highly recommend this razor if you can afford the blades in the long run.

I mean, really, if you\'re a man and you\'re reading this, you probably already own/use Gillette products.  It\'s a given.  They really are the best.  They are also really the MOST EXPENSIVE.I used the regular Gillette Fusion for years now - and just made the \'leap\' to get the Fusion Power.  Why now?  I mean the blades are ridiculously expensive as it is, what\'s another buck or two on top of that?!Tried it for the first time today.  It works well.  The vibrating is a bit weird - it\'s like a hand massage while you shave.  Shaving doesn\'t feel like shaving.  That vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with.  It certainly is painless to use.  It worked well - my skin is smooth.  No telling if it\'s smoother than the regular Fusion.  How could you tell?  I don\'t know if it\'s a gimmick or what - but I did like it.  I\'ll continue to use it, since I bought the darn thing and have no choice.~ EDIT 4/23/2010:  I now hate this thing.  Here\'s why: Within one or two shaves, the \'lubricating strip\' is completely gone.  After that first shave with a nice new blade, it hurts like hell to shave with.  It\'s as if the vibrating effect speeds up the wear and tear on the blades!  It\'s horrible.  It truly is.  On the weekends, after a couple days growth, shaving with this thing is horrendous - I\'ve never had a more painful shave.  The vibrating thing is just a gimmick: aside from that first shave with a new blade, it\'s not nearly as good as the other non-vibrating shaving razors out there.  I find areas all the time that it just did a horrible job on - rough spots.  I can\'t use it on my upper lip - because the vibrating makes my lips chap!  Even turned off, shaving HURTS with this thing!  I\'m throwing it out.  I had this old spare new Schtick razor I keep around and shaved with that a few days ago - WOW.  It\'s awesome!  So smoooooth.

I was excited to buy this new line of product, as being certain it would have been better than the previous line Mach 3 Turbo. Result a real disappointment. Here are the reasons from a Gillette fan you can trust:1. 5 razors don\'t work. Over the years for the sake of competition they made double blades, triple blades than it was not enough they released 5-bladed razors like this one. However, since they needed to put the blades closer to each other to fit 5 blades in a limited area of razor head, it simply didn\'t work. Let\'s continue,2. This product has very sharp blades but since 5-very sharp blades are located very close to each other it resulted very bad maneuverability. You simply cut yourself easily if you made a slight side movement while shaving.3. Blades are so sharp it doesn\'t allow you to focus on flat surfaces for a close shave. It just goes through and if you insisted on getting for a closer shave you will cut yourself.4. You might think I have a sensitive skin type, BUT believe me I don\'t. Believe it or not with a Mach 3 I never cut myself never, never. I have very thick and strong hair, I can\'t use a regular razor for shaving. Only and Only Gillette Mach 3 handles my facial hair but not this one.5. This product has engineering flaws which is resulted from competitive 5-blade which are put very closely together and you cannot handle this razor well even if you are a surgeon. I know because I\'m  very successful with using my hands because of my profession. But thanks to engineers who developed this I cut myself with this razor, for the first time.6. It\'s your choice whether or not you buy this product but I want to remind you that for the first time I\'m taking my time and writing a review for a razor, be careful it\'s a razor not a Gillette anymore.A final personal shaving tip: If you want your high quality razor blades last longer than usual, do not rinse them with hot or warm water while shaving. If you use cold water for rinsing blades, you will see them lasting sharp for a longer period of time.",,,,

I do not understand the purpose of the vibrating feature, but to my surprise it doesn\'t cut me to ribbons, and does indeed seem to have the effect of cutting closer.  There is no substitute for the right shave cream (I use a product called King of Shaves), but the lubricating strip on the Fusion adds quite a bit of \'slick\' on its own.  I have never had a closer shave, and cannot imagine one.  I have had professional straight razor shaves at that barber, and have come home to let the Fusion finish the job.  Yes, the razors are \'price of oil\' expensive, but I find that they last a loooooong time (maybe 2 weeks out of each?), and actually improve with use (they work better with a little seasoning).

I\'ve been using this razor for several months, after waiting to hear from others just how well it works.  I have a fairly tough turf, shaving only MWF, resting on the weekends.  Up until this point, I liked Sensor Excel best, and detest every electric unit I\'ve tried. Since I really like the razor, I was surprised by some of the low rankings. I use Edge gel with extra lubricants, and I shave in the shower (yes, these things make a huge difference).Pro:-Blade life appears improved over my Sensor Excel-Vibrating handle not a gimmick, works well once you get used to it. Initially I found a lack of my normal \'feel\' when shaving, but quickly adapted-A beefy well-weighted handle with a secure seal for the battery.  Other razors have popped apart with the blade flying off on me if I dropped them, but not this one.  My Sensor Excel was notorious for this.-Large blade \'eject button\' is nice, yet doesn\'t let the blade pop off prematurely (see above)-The \'hole\' in the handle head is great! I have a wire rack that holds my shampoo and soap.  This same rack has a few \'hangers\' that this razor slides onto nicely-Very good battery life (still on the first one months later)-Plastic holder has a bigger \'foot\' to stay upright better and it\'s easier to see at a glance how many blades that I have left due to the clear sides, a feature that my Sensor lacks-On/off button flashes when battery gets low... hard to miss and allows you to get a least one shave-Best for last: a very close shave on a very tough faceCon:-Razor head is large, single blade on the back is a good idea and is sharp, but I can\'t seem to make it work as good as it sounds. It\'s a first generation idea that I am hoping gets some refinement.-Price... Ouch! Fewer blades per pack AND much more expensive. Buy in bulk, look for sales, save coupons-Plastic tray is much larger than my Sensor yet holds fewer spare blades (4).-Old blades from Sensor are not compatible with Fusion (you can mitigate this problem by taking your old shaver to work for those embarrassing days when you miss a small spot)Bottom line: Recommended if you\'ve got a rough face! Doing it all over again, I would buy it again.  Also, I recommend that you try different gels, shaving in the shower, different shaver brands as each face is different and Fusion is pricy.",,,,
772,798,20070425,B000BUW8WM,4,"April 25, 2007",A1YFX3KREPTCZ8,Better than I expected,"Before trying this razor, I was using the Mach III (which was a good razor as well, although I never used the Mach III Power); and despite my best efforts not to get sucked into advertising, I decided to try the Fusion Power after seeing the commercials. But now I\'m glad I switched.I only shave every other day, and rarely on weekends, so sometimes I\'ll go 3 or 4 days without shaving. And the Fusion does a great job with the extra growth. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the \'comfort guard\' helps make it a smooth cut. And the power part is a big help; once I\'m done, it\'s a closer shave than the Mach III was. I also have a goatee, and the main blade of the Fusion can actually trim the edges.There are only 2 minor negatives to the Fusion: Cleaning out the comfort guard is a bit of a hassle, and the blue guard makes it hard to see any hair (mine is dark brown) that\'s been caught in it; and the battery indicator is basically useless. It\'s been \'low\' for several weeks, and a brand new battery didn\'t make a difference. So I guess when the razor stops working I\'ll know the battery is dead.Overall, a good step up from a simple razor.Update (11/17/07): It seems I misunderstood the battery indicator, which I apparently didn\'t look at very closely when I bought the razor. I thought the battery symbol on the razor would indicate when the battery was low, and that\'s why I thought it was \'low\' for so long; I didn\'t realize that it was like that all the time! The entire area around the battery symbol and the power button will actually flash orange when the battery is low, as I discovered this week. So I apologize to anyone that might have read my review and was misinformed because of it. And now the only minor negative about the razor is still the issue of cleaning the comfort guard.On the positive side, however, it seems the Fusion will last quite a while on one battery: Mine was still going strong in April when I originally posted this review -- and I had had the razor for some time then -- and despite the fact that I don\'t shave every day, the original battery (which I put back in after a new one didn\'t matter) lasted until now.",,,,

I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.",,,,

The second thing I found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the Mach III, and with very little effort, and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore.

Maybe that\'s where the advances end since I could not tell a difference in shaving between this razor and the Schick Quattro and M3Power razor.  I don\'t feel like it gets a closer shave.  In fact, I don\'t notice any advantages in this razor at all.If you have never used a \'Power\' razor before, try it.  The vibrating that is put off by the batteries is very slight but definitely makes for a closer shave. Battery life is long, and one advantage this razor has is a low battery life indicator. That\'s about it though. The trimmer that was hyped so much is pretty much useless.  I am not a very hairy guy, but I tried it on my sideburns and it didn\'t do anything. Maybe I wasn\'t using it correctly but I couldn\'t tell what it was supposed to do.  As for under the nose, it was worthless there too.The major disadvantage of this razor are the blades.  You\'re going to pay an average of $3 per blade! Considering a blade lasts two weeks at most (which is how often you should replace them, regardless of whether they still work), prepare yourself for a $60 a year razor budget.  The M3Power blades are only $2 a blade, and backwards compatible with previous razors.If money is no object and you don\'t already have an M3Power, this isn\'t a bad razor, but it\'s not nearly worth the hype and price when compared to its predecessor.",,,,

But upon using the 5 blade wonder from Gillette I quickly found that the hype was worthwhile and the end result was the greatest shave I had ever gotten.  Smoother, quicker, and with less irritation then I ever had before.  I tried going back to the Mach 3 but it was impossible, the stakes had been raised.  It was only a matter of time before a womens razor with 5 blades would be released, could the magic happen again?You bet it could.Being in martial arts I found the benefits of shaving areas that men don\'t usually shave as opposed to staying hairy all over (go ahead and insert your metro sexual jokes here) and have used a womens razor for years so I know what I am talking about.  With the edition of the lubricant outer edge, the aforementioned 5 blades, a comfortable grip and a shaving station to put your razor back, this newest invention by Gillette truly is a work of art.  Razor burn is a thing of the past and irritation has been sent out to pasture as well.

After using this razor several times the results were that I always felt or could see hair the next day or two days later.  That leads me to believe that with 5 blades, it\'s still not a close shave.I also felt the razor head was surrounded on all four sides with way too much plastic; making the shaving of more delicate areas, bikini line, etc, a little more challenging.  I felt I was doing some serious contorting in the shower this morning, and felt if I could have removed some of the bulky plastic, I would have been much better off.I did like the shower case that suctioned to the shower wall, I liked that a lot.  I also enjoyed the fact that I didn\'t have any razor burn or bumps.All in all I just don\'t think it\'s worth the hype.

940,967,20080405,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 5, 2008",AWIF8AR75LL9L,So Far It Is A Great Razor,"One problem I have with razors is that the multiple blades tend to clog quickly, making shaving nearly impossible after the first few strokes.This Venus razor seems to do a good job so far- I find that the blades empty out pretty well so far when rinsed.The shaving head glides over the skin very easily and smoothly with no tugging or frustration.  The little rubbery fins seem to keep the head moving at a good pace with no problems so far.  It is flat and hugs the skin well and seems to rotate well without difficulty.I will keep using it and testing it, but I am not sure how expensive the replacement blades are- that is often the problem.  So many times the replacement blades are more expensive than the original razor or close to it.The handle was easy to hold on to despite soapy wet hands.  The wall unit  stayed up well so far on my fiberglass shower wall- it has two suction cups which seems a bit better than other ones I have tried with only one.The extra blade pack stores inside which I like, although it has to be cut into with scissors to get at it, so having it in the shower helps to keep track of it, but not for opening when needed.  You have to get out of the shower to open it.All in all I really like this razor so far- I have used it twice on my legs and it has stayed sharp and effective, but I will edit if I can in the future to reflect any changes in my opinion of this as time goes on.",,,,
942,969,20080402,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 2, 2008",A3H7ADUP07D93H,Works great but no better than Venus Divine,"When I was growing up razors were a simple affair.  A single blade and that was that.  I remember the first ads when double blades started showing up.  The idea, according to the advertisers, was simple: the first blade would pull the hair so that the second blade could cut it closer to the skin, something that to me defied all logic.  I didn\'t have to worry about it for a long, however, as after a while I switched to depilatories.About a year ago I decided to switch back to shaving and went to buy a razor.  To my dismay, pretty much every model had four blades. What in blazes did anyone need all those blades for?  The heads of these razors were huge.  And why stop at 4?  Why not 6, or 8?  All I wanted was a simple double-bladed razor.  No luck.  I ended up getting the Gillette Venus with three blades and I\'ve been quite happy with it.  Seems someone at Gillette, however, thought that more would be better, or at least more profitable, so when I saw this new red five-headed beast offered through Amazon Vine, I thought I\'d give it a try and see if it was all just marketing hype.  I mean, what the hec? You can always use another razor around the house, right?.  To tell the truth though, I wasn\'t really expecting to like it.  I figured it would be bulky and awkward and just not worth the extra cost of the replacement cartridges.Turns out that this is quite a nice razor in spite of the extra size of the cartridge, which is definitely larger than the three-bladed ones.  First of all, I should point out that all Venus razors accept all Venus cartridges.  I was able to swap cartridges just fine between the new Embrace and my old Venus Divine.  It doesn\'t matter whether you bought a plain Venus, a Venus Divine or a Venus Embrace razor.  You can use any of the replacement cartridges with any of the razors.  The biggest difference between the cartridges is not the number of blades, but the amount of lubrication, as I discovered when I accidentally ordered plain Venus replacement cartridges instead of Venus Divine cartridges.To test out this new razor, I compared it to my old Venus razor with a new plain Venus cartridge, using the new razor on one side of my body and the old one on the other.  Much to my surprise, there was a huge difference in effectiveness as well as comfort between the two, with the Embrace cartridge coming up with much more hair.  Also, the lubrication seemed to smooth over the rough edges of any dull blades.  When you have this many blades, some of them are bound to be dull, but at a cost of about three bucks a pop, you don\'t want to have to throw one out.Okay, this is way too long a review for a stupid razor.  In short, both the Divine and the Embrace are great, better than plain Venus cartridges.  If you already have another Venus razor, though, there\'s no need to buy a new one.  Just get a pack of replacement cartridges.Oh, and by the way -- the blade holder thingy fell off my tile in less than 10 seconds and only holds two replacement cartridges anyway.  Gillette should scrap these things, which are just going to end up in landfills.",,,,
944,973,20080402,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 2, 2008",A2V4P6IRCK1P70,Shaving for Dummies - in a good way,"I\'m giving this razor a 4 out of 5 stars because it gives a close shave, but not the closest. It\'s not as effective as previous Venus style blades. The good part is it\'s nearly impossible to cut yourself with this head. It is so wide, and the blades so recessed, that they don\'t really scrape the skin the way you expect. For those used to using the larger Venus blades, this will take only a little adjustment, because it\'s a little wider than the earlier models. For those used to normal shaving heads, this will seem odd and will take quite a bit of adjustment. I don\'t know about using it on more delicate spots - I don\'t think I\'d try.The blades are spaced so that they are surprisingly easy to rinse and they don\'t clog. The handle is probably the best Venus has produced so far. The shower pod is ok - the suction cups actually stick to the wall as they should and it holds a couple of spare blades.If you have trouble with nicks, or if you have boney areas around your knees or ankles, I think you\'ll like this set-up. For my part, it\'s ok, but I\'ll be sticking with the previous Venus blades, which are the best available, and give a closer shave. I might nick myself once in a while when I wouldn\'t with this one, but it\'s worth it to me to get the closer shave. Someone with more sensitive skin might prefer this model, and the moisturizing strips are just right - not too \'gloppy\' but still improving the \'glide\' factor.",,,,

The razor gives the expected 5-blade smooth shave. I tried it myself -- on my face, sillies! The soft green palette is pleasing to the eye, and the shaped handle has a rubberized grip that makes it easy to grasp when wet. The head is large and contoured, ideal for mowing down wide swaths of follicular profusion. The shower caddy is a neat idea. It is backed by two suction cups for gripping the shower stall (tip: works better when wet) that conceals a small, swing-out storage space for extra blades. The swing gets loose easily, so careful! I can\'t speak about price, but typically, 5-blade replacements are fairly expensive, unlike those for my trusty Trac II. Nice product, if the blades last more than a shave or two!",,,,

Unlike double blade or even triple blade razors that I\'ve use in the past, a single well placed passage led to a smooth, hair-free path.

I did not experience any of the slick and greasy feel that another reviewer talked about- however, I have felt this with other Venus blades, and I think this is mainly on the first use, and tends to lessen as the blade is used more.I think the Venus line is great- the handle is easy to hold, the blades easy to attach, and the whole product glides easily over skin.

I shave every day, and it just got to be too much. I switched over to the Soleil - small, disposable and easy to maneuver. When I saw this 5 blade Venus up for review, I thought I\'d take a chance.It does give a nice smooth shave. Is it significantly better than 4 blades? Not that I can tell.The head is HUGE - between the 5 blades, the moisture strips and the rubber \'comfort\' areas, it\'s a pretty massive beast, especially compared to the Soleil. This was a downside for me, as I felt that I couldn\'t necessarily see where it was going - especially in the bikini and knee areas.The rubber gripped handle is very comfy.Overall, it\'s just not my thing, though it\'s not a bad razor.

I really liked the feel of the rubbery handle and the blades moves easily under and over my chin.  It rinses very easily in the tap and the shave feels even closer than the \'Gillette Mach 3\'!  I\'ll probably get at least a few more days out of this.I don\'t think the suction holder for your shower is my style, but it is a convenience.

I have the Venus \'Vibrance\' and am quite happy with it, but decided to try the \'Embrace\' out of curiosity because I cut myself so often with just about any razor I use.  At the same time, it seemed like something with five blades would definitely cut closer and get most of the hair without having to go over multiple times and irritate my skin.  The question is, does it really hug to your curves and get all of your hair in one shave and leave skin smooth?  Yes, it does do a pretty decen job of doing these things, but I didn\'t feel it is a whole lot better than my three blad vibrance blades, except that it shaves just a little bit closer, which is nice.  So, overall, if you have sensitive skin, this might be a good razor for you.  If you like to just shave over an area once and expect to get all of the hair, this is about as close as you will get to that.  God Bless ~Amy",,,,

The lady schick is fine, but not much movement in the head and the shave is thus sometimes not as close as I\'d like. I also tried the Venus with the moisture bars, and that was kind of messy and not really a fit for what I was looking for.Here is what I was looking for and what I found with this Venus Embrace:I want a plain razor, I don\'t want soapy little moisture bars around my blade (one of the previous Venus razor\'s I tried).I want a head that can move with the contours of my body-hey, an armpit is not an easy thing to shave if the head has limited mobility, right?I would love a place to store the cartridges, and with this model the shower caddy opens to keep my spare cartridge-great idea!  Now I don\'t have to rummage around soapy and dripping to find a replacement in the drawer when my blade is dull- it is right there and ready to go!I like something easy to grip.  This razor is slim and sleek and has a nice indent for my thumb and has a sturdy gel grip.I want a razor that gives me a nice shave-this one does it.  Nice and close.The looks of the unit?  Well, not that important if it is good, but this one also has a good design, dual colored in green and glue, with a cute little circular shower caddy.I think it is a good value and I will definitely be ordering refills and keeping this one as my primary razor.I think this one does it all, it is simple, well designed, gives a great shave and has a pleasant design.

Well Venuse Embrace were on sale so I decided to splurge and get it. The rubber handle is great and you can easily hold your grip on the razor. The moisturizing strips are awesome and really make it glide smoothly. You almost don\'t even need the soap (but I still do soap up). If I miss a spot, I can just go right over it without re-soaping leg. I have sensitive skin, so I was worried the five blades would irritate me but its been great, no irritation. Also these blades are lasting a long time. I\'m onto my 5th shave (both legs(thigh & calf) and underarms)and I\'m still getting a great super close shave.  These are definitely pricey, but as a splurge I\'d get them again and recommend to others. Also the little shower caddy does actually work. I was just going to throw the thing out but decided to try it. I figured I would toss it if it fell off. So far its been good and staying place. This is a nice bonus since I can keep the razor out of the reach of my 2 year old daughter. I did keep it on a ledge but it was always knocked down.

The Embrace is the first time I feel like they\'ve improved on the original design.  The Breeze has a similar moisture ribbon, but it always melts off before the blades are worn out, and the heads are just too expensive for that to be tolerable.The moisture ribbon on the Embrace is pretty solid to the touch so you really don\'t get any more than you need and it doesn\'t melt prematurely.  There\'s no residue on my legs when I\'m done shaving, just smooth skin.  The best part is I can have both legs shaved from ankle to hip in one third of the time it used to take me to shave with other razors because I don\'t need to use shave gel, and the handle and the shape of the head make it really hard to cut myself, so I can just go zip-zop.The only issue I\'ve had is that it\'s slightly tricky to shave armpits with the Embrace because the head is so big, and it\'s a bit difficult to maneuver in intimate areas.  It\'s no less effective than other razors, it just takes some adaptation and adds a little time.  That said, all in all, my total shave time -- legs, armpits, intimate region -- is half of what it used to be, and that\'s more than worth the price of the Embrace.",,,,

When my husband tried it, he found the same thing, plus the wide head meant that it really couldn\'t be easily used as a man\'s razor because there were places it just wouldn\'t go-- like under the nose.Still... the Pros --Where this razor absolutely excelled was the \'nick\' test.  I found that no matter how fast I shaved my legs I never came close to cutting myself, even around the knee.

I got a smooth shave without nicks and I found the semi-solid handle to be ingenious.The five blades, on the other hand, seem a bit like overkill.  I shaved one leg with the five bladed Venus Embrace and another leg with my three bladed plain old Venus and I honestly did not notice a difference.  Both were smooth at the start without nicks, and both grew back at about the same rate.  I\'m of the opinion that the quality of your shave depends more on the quality of the blade than simply the number of blades.If you\'re looking to get this razor just for it\'s five blades, I can\'t say it\'s worth the cost.  As a razor, it\'s great, but it\'s not better than a three-blade as far as I\'m concerned.However, the semi-solid handle may be worth it.  It\'s comfortable to hold and use and moves with you to some extent.  It gets in the tight places better than other razors and helps to keep you from pressing too hard against your skin as you go.As for me, I\'m keeping my Venus Embrace handle and buying whatever cartridges are least expensive when I go shopping.

These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.I don\'t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it\'s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I\'ve never had any problems with the handle, and I\'ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.

I dropped my razor in the shower recently and the metal tabs that hold the whole thing together bent and tweaked the cartridge -- this had never happened in years of dropping store-bought Mach3s.

I can run the razor over my skin fast, with very light pressure, and it still shaves perfectly. For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area. With every other razor (even the Breeze, which was my prior favorite) I had to slow way down and go carefully or I\'d nick myself in those spots. So I can shave faster! I shave in the shower, and I don\'t find shave gel or foam to be necessary.My problems with razor burn and bumps in the underarm and bikini area are over. Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions. With previous razors I had to shave those spots repeatedly in different directions, using a lot of pressure, to get a close shave. That lead to painful razor burn, and so most of the time I just tolerated a rough shave there. No more! I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure. Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.There are two things I don\'t like about the Embrace cartridges:Cost: They\'re expensive! But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher cost.The size: They\'re big. The only reason this is a problem for me is the shower pod: Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they *don\'t* fit in the Breeze shower pod.  I ended up buying an Embrace starter pack with a handle and shower pod so I could store the cartridges in the shower pod.  I didn\'t realize until I opened the starter pack that the Embrace shower pod only holds *two* cartridges. So when you open a 4-pack of cartridges, you\'ll have to keep the extra cartridges somewhere else. One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else. It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \'cute\' over making it useful for storage. At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall so it doesn\'t get knocked onto the shower floor and stepped on.(Another reviewer reported that the shower pod keeps detaching from the wall. I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn\'t get bumped and rarely gets splashed. It\'s remained firmly attached for months. I also have a fiberglass shower. I don\'t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy tile.)Summary: The Embrace cartridge gives a truly superior shave. It\'s worth every cent.EDIT: April 11, 2011: Wouldn\'t you know it, shortly after I wrote this glowing review I got a bad batch. The bad cartridges didn\'t shave as smoothly and I had some mild razor burn with them. They also seemed to dull more quickly. Since the bad batch I had tried another box and they worked well again. I am not changing my five-star rating yet, but I will be paying attention to whether the bad box was a fluke, or a warning of quality control problems.",,,,

I tried AXE but found their clear gel to take more layers of application to work with the same effectiveness as Gillette.4) It doesn\'t degrade or melt when taken around in a gym bag. Over time some of the other gels I\'ve bought lose their texture or melt if they\'re not kept cool enough. I don\'t have that problem with Gillette. I can take it to the gym, leave it in my gym bag in a hot car all day long, and it still works perfectly later.Amazon sells these for a very reasonable price compared even with a place like SAMS, so if you like this deodorant, stock up and save some money.",,,,

Without this, I can shave in multiple directions (including completely against the grain), and still have annoying stubble from my upper neck to my chin. When I do take time and use this, however, I can get a close shave and get rid of that stubble only going through the area twice with the razor.

A few months ago a friend stayed with me and after trying my shaving cream he went to the store to \'get some real shaving cream\'.  He bought a can of this Gillette Ultra Sensitive Fusion Hydra Gel, claiming that it\'s the best.  He left it at my house, and eventually I tried it.  I was amazed at how much better it is that all the other stuff I tried.  After I used up that can, I bought this 6-pack from Amazon.

My commute to and from work involves a good deal of walking. Over the years of trying different antiperspirants (Old Spice, Arm & Hammer, Right Guard, etc...) I had finally found something that protected me all day...Degree. I\'d get into work with my shirt looking like I\'d just went through a bit of a downpour, but my armpits were covered.So Degree is my standard of performance to which I judge the Gillette by.I also have a favorite scent of Degree (Power, which used to be Powder...But I\'m guessing the Marketing team thought men would have an easier time picking up Power). In essence my Degree serves as my antiperspirant and cologne.Using the Gillette is certainly different and away from the norm...Instructions state that the product should be applied before going to sleep and you\'ll be all set for the following entire day! Supposedly you could even take a shower and still be protected!As well, the stuff goes on clear and clean. The next morning you don\'t even know you\'ve got anything on, and it delivers on its\' promise of all day protection as well.This product really is an excellent antiperspirant, the only reason I didn\'t give it a full 5 stars is that I feel too high a premium is asked for this product. Even at the current sale price, I can get almost 2x more of my usual Degree antiperspirant at 1/2 the cost of just 1 of these Gillettes (yes, taking into account that this is a 2pack of Gillettes)!!If you don\'t mind the premium though, and you want something clean, clear and WORKS as promised...Then I wholeheartedly recommend this product.",,,,

It dries pretty quickly so I didn\'t notice it for long. After removing the lid, the deodorant comes up through these 50 holes in the sub-lid. It\'s wide enough for a huge underarm so a lot was wasted as the product cannot be rolled back down. It does work, I loved the way it didn\'t let me get wet at all.  But, I think I know the reason for that. I don\'t know what the deodorant has in it but after about the third day I had it on, I noticed that at the end of the day my underarms were sticky....hard sticky. That night in the shower I couldn\'t get it off.  The only thing I can akin it to is the feeling that 80\'s fry-baby might have now. The sticky that comes from not removing all of the grease from the outside of the baby.  Just sticky.  I quit using it then.  Even after repeated washings with my hand and a washrag, it took me another two days to get it from under my arm.  I gave it to my husband to use and he hasn\'t complained. Of course, he does have hair and tends to use a liquid deodorant anyway.Another thing that bothered me was that upon looking underneath the sub-lid, the product was almost gone.

I shave a lot of stuff- legs, arms, armpits, bikini area, and my big toe. I can get away with shaving some areas once a week, but my legs need to be shaved at least every other day during the summer or there is visable black stubble. I have very sensitive skin that often gets razor burn and ingrown hairs. So I got this thinking, perfect! Three blades= close shave; built in shave gel= more convenient and faster.Well, there are several issues with this razor. During the first use, I noticed two things: One, there is a lot of slobbery goop coming off the razor... and two, the shave gel bars that sit above and below the blades make it very difficult to get a close shave. They do flex a little, but especially when they are new, they are cumbersome and they block the blades from getting close enough to the skin, especially in contoured areas like the knee and the bikini area. It does moisturize well, though, and at least for the first use or two, you won\'t need to use any shaving cream. I didn\'t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn\'t able to shave.By the third use, those gel bars have worn down a little (or a lot) and you can get a closer shave. But now with less slobbery gel goop, you are very likely to have irritated skin or little cuts. I have to use soap to lubricate my skin before shaving if the cartridge is not brand new, and I keep cutting my armpit with this razor and I didn\'t seem to have that problem with the regular Venus razor.The gel is either gone or falls off by about the fifth or sixth use. These cartridges are just way too expensive to have to replace them so often. I found that leaving the razor in the shower cuts it\'s life even shorter so I keep it in a cupboard when I\'m not using it... so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn\'t serve much purpose. Maybe if you are the only one who uses your shower and you shave every time you\'re in there you can get some use out of it.I like using this on my legs during the summer when I shave every day and I don\'t want to spend the extra time with shaving cream. I don\'t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble. I wouldn\'t buy this again- the regular Venus is easier to maneuver and shaves closer. Even if I have to buy shaving cream again.",,,,

What I like best about these razors is no shaving cream or additional lather is required. Just wet the blade and shave away. It couldn\'t be easier. I *hate* to shave and this definitely makes the whole experience a lot more pleasant and easy. The blades are a bit more expensive then the cheap, pink daisy razors that I have always used, but they last for a long time.I have been changing the blade about once every 10 days and I typically shave every other day.

Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn\'t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough. The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin. This interference can also lead to nicks because it\'s difficult to gauge how much pressure to apply to get the razor to meet skin. The gel bars, the selling point of this product, are meant to be a substitute for soap or some other shaving gel. But if you tend to use soap anyway, they are superfluous.That said, this is a decent razor. Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.",,,,

This three bladed shaver glides easily, works well over sharp angles and with its built in shaving soap is the perfect touch up razor before a quick run to the pool.I mounted the included razor case (using the material provided) to the left of the shower head and keep it there in its holder. So far I\'ve managed four shaves off of one blade and I anticipate more.

It comes with a handle and two razor cartridges. The razor handle will hold all Venus razor cartridges, not just the Spa Breeze ones. The entire package was very easy to open and the razor handle and cartridges come in a nice waterproof container that can be stored in the shower, although it\'s not all that sturdy. The package comes with a bracket so you can hang the razor in the shower, however, I couldn\'t figure out how to use it. While the razor cartridge packages are conveniently waterproof, I had a hard time opening them and ended up having to use scissors, which damaged the shaving gel bar a bit.The Venus Spa Breeze Razor was just okay.

You need to be careful how you store the razor in the shower especially if you can\'t figure out how to hang it - put the razor face down and the shave gel bars are activated and the razor becomes messy to use. The handle fits pleasantly into the hand and the cartridges snap on and off quite easily. The shaving gel bars are a unique feature and work quite well, but don\'t expect lather like from regular shaving cream. The razor provides a nice smooth shave although I did knick myself a bit, causing my leg to bleed.Venus Spa Breeze Razor is an interesting concept that is perfect for people that may be traveling and don\'t want to pack shaving cream. However, I\'m not sure how long the shave gel bars last, which makes me a bit wary. In the end, I prefer regular razors and shaving cream.",,,,

It\'s worth the price yet I wish it wasn\'t so high.  I can get quite a few good shaves out of one cartridge if well maintained.  It left my legs very silky smooth.  It didn\'t even feel like I was using a razor.  It felt more like it was gliding on my skin.  This is absolutely a good razor to buy.,,,,

I always found that women\'s razors worked better for this area because men\'s razors are meant for the face (I use the Gillette Fusion for this every other day activity) and have tried quite a bit since I started with this habit back in 2002/2003.  Like with the men\'s razors the products keep getting better with time and the Venus Spa Breeze is no exception.  With this latest incarnation the soap has been attached to the blades and a nice scent has been added as upgrades.  The old Venus blades always worked great but this upgrade is definitely a worthwhile one.  The pros are that the soap produced makes for a smoother shave and more clean and the smell really is nice.  The cons are that I would imagine these new blades are much more $$$ than the old Venus razors with regular cream and the soap attached doesn\'t allow you the same kind of control that you had before.If you like not having to lather up and don\'t mind spending the extra money this is a fine product.  If you want to save some cash and just use lather + the standard Venus product you can\'t go wrong there either.  Gillette makes the best razors around and I don\'t think they will be losing the shaving title any time soon.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,,,,
1591,1643,20090423,B001JQLNFA,5,"April 23, 2009",A4UFU4WKYEUGO,A Lady\'s Razor,"Nicely packaged. The blades are in little plastic capsules that sit inside a plastic housing with a lid. This is a big switch from most ladies razors I have tried. Because the blades are sealed, they don\'t loose their moisturizing gel every time you turn on the shower. The casing comes with a little mounting bracket that is not hard to place or figure out. I have really bad eyesight, so fishing around for a razor without my glasses on can be entertaining.The razor and stem are ridiculously feminine. It really does go right past any attempt at simple functionality and well into something a 14 year old girl would throw a tantrum for. It\'s marvelous. The stem is a very elegant swirly pearl color with all these interesting rubber bits that make it easy to hold. It is easy to hold. I think you\'d really have to make an effort to drop it regardless of how soaped up you get. But you won\'t drop it because you will not want to.The blades are surrounded by these wide pink lip like things that look, to be quite honest, like something you\'d find in a adult movie used by the goddess of immaculate hairlessness. They are squishy and smell wonderful. They also work quite well if you get them damp so you can have a safe dry shave, or touch up.The Venus Breeze razor is really over the top but does function quite well. I tried it out on three day old leg stubble and was left with baby soft skin. I like it. It\'s a private, sweet smelling indulgence that works.",,,,

I thought the shave gel strips would make the razor not shave close or that the shave gel strips wouldn\'t really be able to take the place of shave gel.  Then, I gave it a shot.  Wow!  The shave gel strips are quite effective and the razor shaved as close as any razor without the strips.  On purpose, I didn\'t use lotion or anything after shaving my legs to see if there would be any kind of razor burn from not using a shave cream, soap, etc.  Nothing!The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was due to what you get for the price.  The package says it is a one count, but goes on to say there are two of the head pieces included.  In other razors, this would typically mean there is one full razor (handle and head piece) and two refill head pieces.  On this, you get one handle and two head pieces.  At $10.99 a package, that makes these $5.50 each which is pretty pricey for a ladies razor.  I\'m also a little concerned that the life of the razor might be short because once the strips are gone, it is just a plain razor.  I\'ll have to update to let everyone know how long the strips lasted.UPDATEUnfortunately, this razor didn\'t stand the test of time.  The first shave was great.  The second was okay, but the strips were drying up.  On the third shave, one of the now dried up strips fell off.  On the second razor in the pack, it lasted about five shaves before one of the strips fell off.  So, I can\'t recommend this product.",,,,

The two \'shave gel bars\' do the job nicely, providing just enough lather to smooth your shave. The green tea scent fades pretty quickly (after a few uses), but that wasn\'t a concern.I\'ve used other Venus razors before, and my favorite is still the 5-blade Venus Embrace. But the Spa-Breeze, seems to be a less expensive and even \'Green\' alternative, thanks to the fact that I can use it without shave cream.The 5-blade embrace does deliver a slightly closer shave, but I\'d still say the Spa Breeze is worth a try if you\'re not \'addicted\' to a 5-blade razor.",,,,

It did take some getting used to in the beginning figuring out the angle to get the best cut with the upper and lower moisturizing bars sticking out further than the blade, but now it\'s a \'breeze\'.  It\'s also nice that you don\'t have to worry about applying shaving cream to hard to reach places or that it will wash off - it\'s always on your razor!  As a busy mom with a one and three year old, I\'m not shaving every day, but I definitely found myself shaving more often because it took less time.

I will also say that my beard typically comes in patchy and the hair on my face is usually pretty coarse.  Everyone\'s face is different and this should be taken into consideration.  This razor feels very comfortable in my hand and perhaps even lighter than most razors.  Traditionally, I have shyed away from Gillette razors as they have a tendency to provide a more painful shave for me.  There seems to be more tugging and pulling then other razors I have used.  I have always found that a Schick Titanium typically gives me a more comfortable shave.  The Proglide is no exception as I still found it to be pulling a bit much to my disappointment.  I also noticed a bit more irritation on my face the next day, but nothing too bad.  However, I will say that this is, by far, the closest shave I have ever had with any razor.  I believe I actually said \'wow\' when I was done shaving.  In my mind I had to determine what the trade off was.  More comfortable versus closest shave.  For now, I am sticking with the Gillette in hopes that my face gets a little more used to it.I knocked off two stars for the following reasons:1) Price!  The razor is not too expensive, but a 4 pack of blades is about $16 at my local gorcery store.  By far, the most expensive blades in the aisle.2) Lack of comfort...it tugs and pulls a bit...and left my face slightly irritated.Overall, its a good razor.

But with electric, it was frustrating because I could never get the satisfying shave a blade can get me.After seeing all the advertisements for the Proglide I couldn\'t resist so I decided to try it out.  I put on some shaving cream and tried this bad boy out and it sent chills up my spine as I glided this thing across my sides and chin.  I even went against the grain and it was just so smooth.  Now for the ultimate test.... I grimaced as I anticipated pain as I was about to shave my mustache area and I couldn\'t believe how it just cut away at all my hairs.

It was (and still is) a truly revolutionary, advanced and innovative shaving system that made shaving virtually painless and hastle-free even for men with tough beards and/or sensitive skin. The ProGlide is the latest incarnation of the Fusion and it does offer some advantages over the original Fusion but not nearly enough to justify switching over (especially when considering that the replacement cartridges will be even more expensive than the manual Fusion\'s!). When I shaved my head with the ProGlide, I honestly noticed NO difference whatsoever (neither better nor worse) than when I shave with the manual Fusion. When shaving my face, I did notice that the ProGlide DID do a slightly better job than the manual Fusion at shaving tricky and hard-to-reach areas (especially the moustache area just below the nostrils and around my Adam\'s apple) but this is probably because the ProGlide\'s cartridges are supposedly 15% thinner than the Fusion\'s. I should also point out that the ProGlide\'s handle feels more sturdy and offers a (somewhat) tighter grip than the (manual or Power) Fusion\'s and that the design is more elegant but (of course) beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The Bottom Line: Fusion ProGlide offers some minor improvements over the manual Fusion but nowherenear enough to justify upgrading to an even more expensive product when an already excellent one is available.",,,,

If it does what it says, I was finally ready.  I was tired of the electric razor, shaving my neck was always a difficult adventure, always had to pre-shave so that the hairs were not too long, or the electric would yank those hairs out!So I finally took the plunge, while out picking up a few things, I grabbed the Gillette Fusion Proglide, and took it home, hoping that it was as easy as it sounded.  Since shaving with a electric was a different animal, and I wasn\'t sure how to go about it, I checked out the Gillette site to find a nice video on pre-shaving rituals, and much more.So after dinner I went at it, this rookie prepped his skin and hairs, and foamed up with the gel that came with the razor.  I started slowly, and softly, and there was barely any feeling.  As I started to figure out how much pressure I could use, and what was the best direction to shave the parts of my face, it was a snap.The first shave took me as long as my electric, but I that\'s the first time rookie shave, it will, and did get easier as I went along.  It was sooooo easy to shave my neck, and absolutely no tugging, and didn\'t get a nick or cut.Being the first manual razor I\'d ever own, and being an absolute rookie at this, the Gillette Fusion Proglide was  the best shaving experience I\'d ever had, and I would recommend the razor to everyone!",,,,

But is it sigificantly better than the original fusion? This is what I\'ve found. I shave in the shower, warm water, using a unscented Gillette shaving gel. The handle of the proglide has a slightly different shape, more of a knob at the end. I suppose the knobv makes it easier to grasp the end of the razor when making gentle swipes alog the skin, sort of an artist at work. But the handle of the original fusion is also okay, and I don\'t think the new handle is much of an improvement, if any. The blades in  the cartridge are great, more than marginally better than the original. A few easy swipes do the job for most of the face. I\'ve found the razor shaves closer than the original about the neck and above the upper lip. Result is the shave time is quicker with a good result. I also believe a proglide cartridge will last longer than the fusion. I\'ve used one cartridge for about twenty shaves, and so far it is doing the job. thus, since the cartridge seems to give more shaves, that fact ought to offset the extra cost. Bottom line is, the new proglide fusion is great, better than the original, but since the original fusion cartridges also do a great jobb, I plan to use them up before switching over to the proglide.Update april 2011 - I think the proglide works best for men who shave every day, and against the grain for a close shave. The blades are thin and close and work best with short hairs. When shaving with two or more days of growth, hthen it\'s best to first shave downward, with the grain, and then up against the grain to get a close shave.",,,,

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.

Wow!  This thing actually shaved me well, didn\'t but me up and even had a nice trimming blade on back.  I thought that a four blade razor would be too wide/long to shave well, but I was wrong.  The best part about the Fusion is that the blades last a LONG time.  I mean it\'s nothing for me to get two or three months out of a single blade.  Amazing.The only downside is that they are expensive, but considering how well they shave and how long they last, I still come out ahead.

OK, that\'s a bit of exaggeration on my part, but to be perfectly honest, it actually is the best razor that I have ever used...hands down. I usually only shave once a week (to my family\'s dismay), so my stubble is quite long. I use to have to trim down my semi-beard with an electric razor and then shave, but now I use the ProGlide and it literally \'glides\' through my stubble for a nice clean shave. I also like how the stubble doesn\'t get caught in between the blades. I use to have to bang the razor against the side of the sink to get the captured stubble hairs to come out of the razor, but those days are now long gone.If anyone is reviewing replacement blades (as I am doing here), there should be no question as to the satisfaction of the product (proved by the continuing purchase of the product).",,,,

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.

Then again, I\'m a daily shaver and my hair isn\'t so long after one day that it needs to be \'guided\' into the razor blade.  :)I do like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave.  I never get nicked or scratched when using a Fusion blade unless I\'ve been using it too long; the first nick is a sign that the blade is dull and needs to be replaced, which sometimes happens before the lubricating strip indicates a replacement is warranted.

Also just like the old Fusion blades, you have to be really absent minded to get a nick. I\'d say on average I get about 4-10 shaves out of them before I become frustrated and throw them away.

The proximity of the blades to each other causes rapid build-up of shavings, requiring more frequent rinsing. You pretty much have to rinse the head after each row. Very tedious.3. Even this bloodthirsty capitalist grows weary of Gillette\'s program of forced obsolescence.  I was perfectly happy with the Mach 3 system; now you can\'t even find the blades.

Since I have a unisex name,  I occasionally get men\'s products. Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it. I\'ve never used a razor with the vibrating feature on it before, but I found this great for my legs, especially my knees and ankles. I\'ve NEVER cut myself using this blade, because with the vibration turned on, it\'s pretty much impossible for me to press down too hard. It doesn\'t vibrate too much to where it\'s noisy or annoying.As far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth. I can go 2-3 days between shaves, and when my hair starts to regrow, the hair is finer and not as \'stubbly.\' I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I\'ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus. I also love that this works so well on my underarms. Because it\'s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I\'ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before. This shaves super close without cutting or razor burn. And my legs are smooth ALL day, even if I shave at 8 in the morning. They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night. Ladies, you know what I\'m talking about.I haven\'t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy. The blades seem to last a while, at least 3-4 weeks shaving every other day or so. However, when they go dull, they go dull quickly.The only things I didn\'t like about this razor: one, it didn\'t come with a blade refill, like every other razor I\'ve ever bought, so that was kind of annoying. Also, the refills are expensive. Don\'t buy the \'power\' refills if you don\'t use the trimmer- that\'s the only difference between the \'power\' blades and the \'manual\' blades, and there\'s a dollar difference between the two. I don\'t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out that it\'s just an exposed blade on the opposite side, but I can see how men might find it useful.Overall, this is my favorite razor.

He\'s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.His current razor is a Mach 3, so he did side by side comparisons between that one and this Fusion Proglide. He did the typical half-the-face test where he shaved each half with one of the razors. He did comparison tests where he tried it powered and non-powered.For all of these tests, the result - the shave closeness - was about the same. This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.As for the *process* of shaving. running the Fusion Proglide with the power off felt similar to using the Mach 3. However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \'pull\' - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  I\'ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.He was expecting the trimmer blade to be pretty useless - but it turns out it was pretty convenient for trimming. You can\'t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.He used it for a half dozen shaves, and the blade still has a little life left, which is on par with a Mach 3.For people who already have a Mach 3 and didn\'t care about the \'shaving process itself\', there\'s no real reason to change blades. People who are having issues with tugging and pulling might appreciate the smoother shaving experience with the Proglide.On the issue of blade cost, if you buy the Proglide blades in bulk, you can get blades closer to $3 a blade. Still, this can seem expensive compared with other options.In the end we\'re hoping when we run out of Mach 3 blades that the blades for this one might have dropped in price and we\'ll move over to the Proglide. However, but it\'s not like we\'d toss out the Mach 3 and the existing blades in order to use this.",,,,

1998,2070,20100702,B003987CL0,1,"July 2, 2010",AU70G084OYMMM,Nothing special about this razor when compared to the others.,"I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age. The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better but that was always not the case. So I\'ll briefly compare this to the other razors I\'ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel. The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade. Thats all I have to say about that.The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner. Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same. So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave but I still decided to stick with the comfort of the Mach 3. So up till now the Mach 3 was my razor of choice.Now the story changes a bit:I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided. I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking I would never use anything else. BAD DECISION!!!! My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power. At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I\'m getter older so it\'s my skin\'s fault. I would get ingrown hairs and it was then embarrassing to go out. I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved. I tried various skin treatments to rid of the irritations and redness but nothing would work. The problem with the fusion was that the blades would only last about 3 shaves and then irritate the hell out of your face. ONE DAY I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY ANOTHER RAZOR.I then bought the Schick Quattro Titanium and boy was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion. It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever. They would stay sharp for months and wouldn\'t clog if a shave gel was used.(I know people complain that it clogs but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh it doesn\'t).Now Hydro 5 vs. Fusion ProglideHydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5. At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water. The shave was not as close as I would have wanted. The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge. Still I kept on using it since it came with 2 refills anyway. The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.Fusion Proglide: I bought the sneak peek package just to try the razor before it came out and all I can say is AWFULLLLLL!!!!!!! This time I couldn\'t even get one good shave from this crap. Turns shaving into gliding my A$$!!!! It\'s very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot. So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I\'ve ever used so far. The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind the exaggeration but you know what I mean).Final verdict: Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers. They are nothing but marketing now. Up until the Mach 3 they were my razor brand but the fusion and fusion proglide are nothing but scams. They look cool but I think they are face wreckers. Then again I have sensitive skin so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise. Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help. So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin. It will not clog with Zirh or Anthony Logistics shave gel and causes no irritation. The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates. Sorry for long review but I just had to share my experience.",,,,

I usually shave every day or two but to test this \'gliding\' i wait about a week so the hair would be almost too long for a hand held razor, but to my amazement it still managed to not have any tugging on the hair. This razor also has a single blade for trimming which is good over all but tends to clog up pretty fast.

I thought that this one would be an improvement and I was excited about getting the pro glide version. Like a dummy I didn\'t test it first and got the bulk set from Costco.This is by far the worst razor ever. There was no gliding at all, it was more like grinding. It irritated the hell out of my skin and it was the most uncomfortable shave ever. It felt as if it was pulling each hair out of my face and I was bleeding everywhere. At first I thought that OK maybe its was this specific blade I was using so I got another blade, the same. The next morning I pulled out  an old unused single blade disposable I had for emergencies and it was much more comfortable then this one. I absolutely hate this razor, I ended up giving away the other unused blades. I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor. Felt great. Best shave ever. This did everyting that the Pro glide promised to do. I had no irritation of the skin and the shave was very comfortable and close.I would NOT recommend this razor at all. I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I thought that this was supposed to the best for sensitive skin...WRONG.Do yourself a favor and don\'t spend you money on this overpriced crap.

Razor handle has a nicer and more expensive \'feel\' to it. It has a little heft, so to speak.CONCERNS / ISSUES:1. The razors are materially more expensive than the Mach 3. It\'s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money. If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I\'d go with this one.2. The razors are thinner. I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.3. Amazon has great info and instructions. The razor itself does not. It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box. For example, I really wasn\'t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head.

I figured this was just an attempt to sell us something all us fusion owners already had and my suspicion was furthered by other reviews posted here, which said the proglide was not much of an improvement over the fusion. But I decided to try it as I love new toys and though I really like the fusion I don\'t think it is perfect as occasionally it does give me razor burn. So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion. I don\'t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced. Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn\'t think it was perfect.

After buying the Proglide on Saturday and shaving that evening, I didn\'t shave till Tuesday night & that\'s cause I wanted to. I could have went a couple more days but I like a smooth head so I shaved. I couldn\'t believe how close a shave I got with this blade and went for days without any razor burn or irritation at all and that\'s going with the grain. I always liked going against the grain cause it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was, my head couldn\'t take the pain afterwards so I stuck with going with the grain. With the Proglide I\'m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road I\'ll give it a shot because just going with the grain I get a damn close shave.

First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  However, once you power it on, the vibration allows it to glide smoothly over your body.  When I shave with my normal razors I always get pin hole knicks all over my body (about 8-15) and come out of the shower bleeding. With this razor, I only had one knick--simply amazing. Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.I also had my boyfriend try it and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily but he could get use to that.

As such, my review will not apply to men who want to know how it glides on the angles of their face, or how it trims the hair near their nose, etc.  Sorry.If you\'re a woman reading this - here\'s what you need to know:First of all, I\'m a teensy bit OCD when it comes to shaving my legs; I shave them every day and sometimes twice a day.  I know - it\'s stupid - I can\'t help it.  Anyway, I thought a power razor would be an easy way to do a quick shave when I\'m doing a 2nd shave of the day... so I wouldn\'t have to get in the shower a 2nd time.  I imagined that the reason for a power razor was that you could use it dry.  No.You still need wet skin to use this razor, and really - wet skin with some sort of lubricant (body wash, etc) is best.  I don\'t really understand why you need a vibrating \'power razor\' when you still have to have wet skin and shaving cream (or similar) to use it.  What is the advantage of the power?  Why not use a regular razor if you\'re doing all that anyway?  There\'s probably some reason that I don\'t get, and I\'m certainly not going to take away stars for my own ignorance, but I\'m just telling you in case you thought you could use this razor dry.As a razor in the shower, it shaves well.  The shave is close and smooth, with no nicks.  Personally I prefer the Schick Intuition since you can skip using the body wash with that (as it has it\'s own lubricating bar).  But this one shaves very well, and an advantage over the Intuition is that it has a \'floating\' head that goes over bumps like knees more easily and smoothly than a stationary blade like the Intuition.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the replacement heads are pretty pricey, and seem to get dull fairly quickly.BOTTOM LINE:  As long as you know what you\'re getting, it\'s a good comfortable razor that\'s easy to hold and shaves well.",,,,

I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn. Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head. I have been shaving my head for 10 years and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head, I couldn\'t believe how baby skin soft my head felt. Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head. I shave my head once a day and sometimes twice. On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times. I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried. I have had no razor burn or cuts with this Power Proglide razor.  I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush. I can honestly say that there is not too much difference with using these shaving gels/soaps with the Gillette Power Proglide.The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin. I can usually get about 5 complete head shaves (several times with the grain and against the grain) and beard shaves  with one razor before I need to replace it. The trimmer is quite helpful to trim around and outline my beard, goatee, mustache and even the occasional eyebrow. The only negative for this razor is the price.If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.",,,,

But for most guys, it simply doesn\'t deliver the closeness the \'old-fashioned\' 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:1) They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  But in the current Proglide commercial, the cartoon is altered to show the second blade doing nothing except scraping the skin, with the hair ending up sticking out above the skin surface.  Major BS here by Gillette.2) If you\'re not comatose, you\'ll notice on their \'Take the Proglide Challenge\' commercials (the one with the used-car salesman guy), they are actually comparing Proglide vs. a DISPOSABLE RAZOR!!!  What does that prove?  How low can Gillette go???Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn\'t totally worthless.  They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  Bottom line is, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.

I lathered up and was amazed as the razor glided effortlessly over my face and through the stubble, giving the smoothest, most comfortable shave that I have had. Not a bit of drag or irritation was experienced, so I let my beard grow for a week, thinking that this time it would fail the standard it now set. To my amazement, the shave was still superb with no irritation. I finally tested it by shaving daily with the same results.Concerning the lubricating strip, it is a definite improvement, being more slick and lasting longer while the handle allows a more secure and comfortable grip than its predecessor. I\'m still on my first blade after 4 weeks and the shave is still very comfortable. The single blade at the back of the blade head does a great job especially above the top and lower lip, and the soft blue glow of the power button does add a cool touch.

Despite their abundantly mass-produced stock, they have been well-built (some more than others) and have stood the test of time.  These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I\'m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  While Gillette\'s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  Where I know some bumps on my cheeks and chin should be, the vibration may confuse me and cause me to improperly shave and leave some spots thicker than others.The blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I\'m considering doing the ol\'-fashioned wet shaving.All in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.",,,,

More blades, more power, and whatever else their powerful marketing machine is able to drum up.  However, coming from the standard Fusion line, I can\'t believe the difference this razor makes.  Maybe it\'s the vibration, maybe it IS the thinner blades, but whatever it is, it works.My beard is very coarse and grows like a caveman.  I can be completely smooth in the morning and by 7:00 at night, my face feels like sandpaper.  Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  The ProGlide is like butter.  Easily lumberjacking the thousands of mini pine trees that decorate my face.  This is my first experience with a \'powered\' razor.  I\'ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  Perhaps this is the reason the ProGlide feels to smooth.  Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  My face stays smooth ALL DAY.  I do have to shave the next morning, but if I wanted to, I could go into work (like I did today) with a minor sandpaper face.  However there is a cost for all of this handsomeness and it\'s the cost of those blades.  $3.30/each from Costco.  That\'s outrageous, but my wife does love a smooth face and I can\'t deny her that.",,,,

They increased the number of blades, but used cheaper and duller blades, so the end result was a lot of grabbing and pulling on my skin, something I never experienced with the Mach 3.  The construction was also cheap, I had a Fusion break apart on me after a year.  I\'ve never had a Mach 3 break, over 10+ years of use.The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  But the trimmer would get clogged with hairs, which is annoying.The Fusion Proglide replaces the Fusion\'s dull blades with sharp blades that don\'t tug or pull on my skin, they just glide through and cut as they\'re supposed to.  Plus, this keeps the trimmer while improving it\'s design to allow hairs to wash away without clogging.",,,,

The wet shaving methods and products are far superior to other shaving mechanisms, but the time it took to safely use a double edge razor took up 25 minutes of my morning for a three pass shave avoiding major nicks along the way.  Using the Proglide I can confidently shave at a pace that is about 4 times faster without nick concerns.  The floating blades so effectively follow the contours of my skin that I get as close as shave as I ever have before.  The benefit of the power micro-vibrating effect is the blade cuts while it \'floats\' over the skin.  It is a great combination to safely cut against the grain in places where I dared not take my double edge razor.  Total time for a wet shave with three passes was about 10 minutes and this was the first time I\'ve used it.  I would expect it to be about 5-7 minutes next time.In defense of double edges, they still remain the best performance/price ratio of any disposable razor.",,,,

We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs.

I have used Gillette products since I first started shaving, way back in the winter of \'97-98.  At that time I was borrowing my dad\'s Mach III to shave my sparse mustache (lip hair).  Since then I graduated to the Mach III, Mach III Turbo, Mach III Turbo Power, and finally the Fusion Power.  These blades last me (again at 2 per week) for about 1.5 months before they are noticeable duller.  Thus, this is good value (I paid $19 for the 6 pack last time I ordered.).

(my first razor was the Gillette Sensor)I do believe this gives me the best shave from Gillette since I started using their cartridge razors.  The problem is that with each new razor comes a price increase.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor cartridges sells for $3.50-$4.00 per cartridge...Ouch!!  Thinking for years that buying the 4 and 8 pack refills was a rip-off, I looked into DE shaving.  I bought an old Gillette Super Speed safety razor and a sample pack Double Edge razor blades and started learning the proper way to shave.  A little math now...at $3.50/cartridge for Gillette Fusion I will spend $182.00/year for razors.  I can\'t use them for more than a week.  In fact the proglide razor seems to lose performance after the 3rd shave for me, but I push it to 6 shaves.  I can buy a 100 pack of Astra DE razor blades for $15.75.  That\'s (rounded up) $.16/razor.  I can use them for 1 week also, so I spend $8.32/year for DE razors.  After a couple month of learning to shave with a DE razor I\'m now getting the same (if not better) results than I get with the Fusion Pro Glide.  The only advantage that the Fusion ProGlide has over old school DE razors is that it is a little quicker, but $173.68 per year in savings is enough to get me off the cartridge razor bandwagon, and into the Double Edge Razor bandwagon.

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,

Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies.  The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing.  They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry.

The idea of a 5-blade razor may seem extreme to some but it really does work well and (with proper preparation) will give you the smoothest shave possible. For me, the best thing about the Gillette Fusion system is I can shave (both my head and face) with virtually NO irritation, redness or razor bumps AND get it done very quickly (at least in comparison to single or twin-blade razors). Case in point: I used to literally tear up my neck (especially around my Adam\'s apple area) years ago when shaving with single or 2-blade razors but with the Fusion I get a nick-free shave almost every time.",,,,

The shave cannot leave spotty stubble, and the blade can\'t dull after 2-3 attempts either.These Fusions are the best blades I\'ve used for the task. I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face. The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.Even with a week\'s growth on the head, the blade is up to it (granted, I\'m pretty bald, so we\'re not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here). It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that\'s needed.The one flaw is not the blade\'s fault - but it\'s still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you\'re using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.I\'ve cut myself quite a few times, usually on the fingers when I\'m switching hands, or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick. It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot. It can be the kind of cut you\'ll actually need to pay attention too.Other blades can cut too, of course, but this razor\'s series of blades will make it quite a bit worse. If it was just my face, I probably wouldn\'t make the mistake, but since I\'m shaving my head I can\'t always see what I\'m doing, and that can be the problem. I\'ve never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.That is not the blade\'s fault - it\'s mine! But I can\'t imagine I\'m the only one whose done this. I know we\'re all careful with blades, but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.But - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised.

The idea of 5 blades that are battery operated to vibrate in an orange handle seemed like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Very gimmicky and overkill and bordering on kitsch.  But rather than going through the hassle of returning them I popped in the battery after rolling my eyes at this corporate invented need and gave it a try.  As much as I wanted to hate it, I found it to be a definite notch up the shaving food chain.  The blades are very sharp and the vibration somehow seems to allow the head to glide more smoothly and evenly over the beard.  The shave and closeness were the best I\'ve ever experienced.  Even the single blade on the opposing edge for maneuvering in tight crevices like under the nose worked perfectly.  All this comes with a cost.  When I surfed over to see what the cartridges actually cost I was horrified.  Soon they\'ll need to be locked in a glass container at the grocery store with an armed guard in front of the display.  Second, not sure if it\'s planned obsolescence engineered into the cartridges, but the blades seem to last only a few shaves, making them even more costly.  The blades being mounted so close to each other also make them hard to rinse and they clog easily.  Buying in larger quantities lowers the cost per unit somewhat.

This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90% of the replacement blades, I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop (presumably glue) all over the blade, with the single blade missing! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems, as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet, and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality. I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke, but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades, I think it\'s time to call a spade a spade. I shave my head and my face both, and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors, and even with a fresh blade, many times it feels as though I\'m shaving my face/head with a sharp rock. needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase.",,,,

EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as \'Clean Shower\' or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.)Then I set the razor so it\'s standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I\'d also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I\'ve been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I\'ve nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I\'m very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.)Note to Gillette...

However I got the razor and 1 blade free in the mail and gave it a try.  I have been using the same blade for 4 weeks now and I love this thing.  I feel like that thing performs wonderfully well.  The shaves are close and it has minimized the need for shaving in reverse which i need to do.  Also i feel that the strips on this last longer because i still get that squeeky clean and smooth feeling each time.  Another big plus is how easily the hair is cleaned from this blade.  The running water removes all hair thanks to the design that leaves the front and back of the blades fully exposed.  I must say that this product exceeded my expectations.  However, i have taken off a star due to its expensive blades (almost $3.50 per blade, retail).

I am currently a Mach 3 user and I love it so I wondered if this Fusion thing would make a big difference.  I honestly feel that the shave with the Fusion is of the same closeness at the Mach 3.  However the Fusion has a HUGE bonus the extra blade (six) on the back of the shaving headto hit those stray hairs that remain under the nose that the Mach 3 normally misses.  Also it is much easier to trim sideburns with the Fusion because you do not have to worry about hacking off a huge chunk with the mass of 3 blades with the Mach 3.  A bit pricey and if the razor came at the same price as the Mach 3 I would commit to the upgrade, (Very Hard for guys to change hygeine products, we love the good old reliables).  If you do not have a Mach 3 then I recommend purchasing the Fusion.  Bottom line: Close shave, nice sideburn and stray hair trimmer, nice overall design of the handle, and a good looking razor.

They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else.

Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren\'t secured in their package.  Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  And since you\'ve already bought the item, there is no need for overly attractive packaging either.  The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can\'t re-use the packaging from the store).As far as longevity, I\'m probably about as tough of a test case as you can imagine.  I\'ve got thick, stubborn hairs on my next that lay sideways and reverse direction in certain spots.  Every time I shave these razors get a good workout.  When a razor is too worn, it is a painful experience and leads to immense amounts of irritation.  Needless to say, I notice pretty quickly when these get dull, and the razors from Gillette through Amazon take just as long to dull as do the razors from Gillette through the grocery store...this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.

It\'s triple blade design seems like overkill, I mean really, I can get just as close of shaves with a classic DE safety razor, and have less razor burn. If you haven\'t learned already, more blades dragging across the surface of the skin means increased chance for razor burn, it\'s just that simple. So while this razor is less prone to give razor burn than the 4 and 5 blade designs, it\'s still going to be worse than a 2 or single blade design. We\'re talking about human body hair here, we\'re not using it to shave an angora rabbit.The 3 blades are spaced well enough apart that they don\'t easily clog, and rinse very easily. The handle is nicely contoured and easy to hold without slippage at most any angle, and is textured enough not to be slippery when all soapy. Speaking of soapy, those little goo-bars on the razor are awful. They turn to slime, clear slime like when you blow your nose with a bad head-cold. It\'s just stringy and disgusting looking. They also do little to help the blades glide over wet skin. I ended up with the worst razor burn I\'ve ever had by trying to use this razor on wet skin. Once I went back to foaming up my legs with a super-slick tallow shaving soap, I was able to get irritation free shaves.The little goo bars don\'t last past 4 shaves for me before they\'re gone. They don\'t last nearly as long as the blades stay sharp. Cost-wise I\'m not thrilled either, with the price of the cartridge refills.

This new holder is MUCH smaller and suctions to the wall. You just slide the neck of the razor into the holder, and that\'s it. I\'m not sure why they changed this. I would think wall space in the shower isn\'t really something most people are trying save, and now, your spare razor heads have to be kept outside of the shower. To some this may not be a big deal, but I ALWAYS change to a new razor head while I\'m in the shower.Overall, I still love the razor and the job it does, but the new holder design is, IMO, no good.

They\'re not perfect, but they\'re the best that I\'ve found.  When I saw this new Venus Pro Skin, I decided to give it a try because it\'s actually cheaper than buying a new pack of blades (less blades, so more per blade, but cheaper overall) and you get a new handle with it, which is always nice because the handles can get dirty over time.The box opened astonishingly easy.  No scissors required.  This handle is a little bit longer and has more of an angle to it than other handles in the Venus series.  I thought that was nice.  The see-through light blue color was very pretty too.  Compared to my old Venus, this razor looked sleek and shiny.  I become more skeptical when I examined the new razor heads, though. The razor is surrounded by two gel pads.  There\'s nothing backing them, no plastic holding them on.  They move easily up and down as you touch them.  I\'ve had experience with some of these in-head shaving gel products before and have found that they usually completely fall apart or all of the lotion/gel is gone in about two shaves, when of course the razors should last much longer than that.Using the razor I found that it felt very nice on my skin.  I could tell the gel was helping lubricate the skin, but it wasn\'t overly sudsy.  However large strings of gel kept coming off the razor.  This was a little bit gross.  Also the head was too large to fit into tight curves and made it really hard to shave certain spots.  As I expected, one shave used about half of the gel pad, which is a big disappointment.The big test for me is after I get out of the shower, though.  For the first time in ages I didn\'t have any nicks from shaving with a new blade!  I always dread switching blades because I always get cut up.  Also my legs didn\'t itch.  I frequently have trouble with razor burn and itching, and this product actually solved that for me when nothing else has.So where does that leave me?  This product worked wonders for protecting my skin when nothing else has.  I love it for that reason alone.  But the gel pad isn\'t going to last more than a few shaves, which would mean that I\'d have to buy a new head every few days.  That would be ridiculously expensive, but honestly maybe worth it considering how much I do suffer from razor burn normally.  I think if you have problems with razor burn, you should give this product a try.  If you\'re looking for a new handle for the Venus, this one is very pretty.  But if you\'re happy with your current shaving gel routine, these gel pads are bulky and won\'t last hardly any time at all.  For those people, I think this product is a waste of money.",,,,

2700,2785,20120430,B0062IWQVU,3,"April 30, 2012",A3537EPEV8HXBW,Not great but OK,"This is a good idea, but the trimmer is not worth the price. The blades are excellent though. If you want to use the trimmer to do some edging, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. It\'s not powerful enough to do edging. It works fine trimming with each of the combs, but edging is out. My 20 year old Con-air trimmer does better due to more power (2 AA batteries as opposed to 1 AA battery for the styler). And the replacement cartridges prices are insane, although you can get the 6 cartridge replacement from Amazon for cheaper than you can a 4 cartridge replacement at any store. I suggest buying the fusion proglide razor instead of the 3-in-1 trimmer. Not worth the money for the trimmer",,,,

The edge trimmer located at the top of the blade head for line shaping is only average, but the close shave using the blades is smoother than any used before. The three beard trimming combs for length do a great job, but I wished there was a few longer lengths available. I recommend this this styler to anyone.",,,,

I shave and trim my beard, so I figured it would be nice to have them all in one. The fact that they come from Gillette gave me the confidence to try it without hesitation about the quality of the product. They did not disappoint - it is a very well made device, versatile and compact and they don\'t force you into buying a new type of razor heads - the ProGlide ones from a regular razor fit. I am glad I bought it!",,,,

I wish the trimmer length was adjustable (though since i usually go shortest length, it\'s fine - I never seem to remove the guide for the shortest beard length), and wish the razor wasn\'t a snap on snap off piece (same for the trimmers).  I don\'t seem to use the razor blade - I use my separate Fusion razor for shaving.  In the end, I have a really good $20 trimmer, which isn\'t a bad thing.",,,,

I had let my beard get out of hand in the last month or so and when I saw this on the television I decided to check it out. The price is what really drew me to the item. I used the clickable coupon that was available on Amazon and I think I ended up paying less than $15 for the item because I\'m also a Prime member. The item arrived 2 days later and I was trimming away. I actually enjoyed using the product. It looks and feels like a quality shaver and trimmer. I also like that it is powered by batteries because I use rechargeable batteries. I actually haven\'t used the shaving part of the unit because I really hate shaving. I was able to trim my beard on my neck so closely that it shaving wasn\'t really necessary. Still I\'m impressed with how the razor attaches and vibrates. I\'m sure I\'ll use it eventually, even if just out of curiosity, lol. Love this purchase.",,,,

Does it give a smooth shave...of course it\'s a Venus razor, is this the most expensive cartridge...YES. Is it the best....NO. The Olay strips do not last more than 3 shaves. It was never exposed to direct water so I was really disappointed in them. The very first shave is AMAZING! It\'s so smooth & glides over you skin without even feeling like its touching, by the 3rd shave, it\'s the WORST Venus cartridge I have ever used.Sticking with Venus, but not buying into the hype from the Olay strips!",,,,
