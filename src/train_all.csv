With flossing and this brush I intend to m�ke this a daily habit for the rest of my life.  It is a godsend!!

I am tough on regular tooth brushes and usually would have to change every two weeks.  This is such a great & durable product.

Thanks to Amazon, they are available easily online.  The center polishing portion of the brush is fantastic for giving your teeth that slippery smooth feel of \'real clean.\'  I recommend these as your main brush or as a suppliment to the other brushes used with most of the Oral-B handles."

Manual razors, especially disposable ones, are more effective for me, but with my skin as sensitive as it is, I\'m usually decorating my face with little bits of tissue when I\'m through.With this razor, I get the best of all worlds.  With 5 blades, it\'s hard to miss a spot, and it takes less time overall to get the job done.  The vibrating gives it an extra \'kick\' and makes the shave more effective.  The best part is that there is virtually no sign of irritation.For those who are having trouble using this razor against 2- or 3-day-old beards, just be patient and let the razor (and its vibrations) do the work.  Pull your skin so the part you\'re shaving is good and tight and the stubble is separated as much as possible.This razor gives me, by far, the closest shave ever, and with no irritation.    "

The comfort and overall maneuverability of the design are wonderful.  I am able to easily get a great, close shaving angle on my cheeks, neck, and chin, plus the blades are consistently sharp and smooth.  I can count on this razor to give me a close, comfortable shave without great effort or the need to shave some areas several times to catch what escaped the first, second, third passes with the razor.The only issue I have with this razor involves difficulties shaving right under my nose.  I can\'t seem to make the razor catch those whiskers without the scary prospect of inserting part of the razor head into my nostrils.Still, this is the best I\'ve found.    "

Though it neither possesses zillions of blades nor vibrates, it shaves closer than razors that do. Cartridges for it are also slightly cheaper than those for the Mach 3 or other high-end razors.These 5-count packages (bundled in packs of 2) are also a phenomenally good deal, especially if you purchase them using Amazon\'s subscribe-and-save. My only complaint is that, in these bundles, the blue lubricating strip normally at the top of the razor has been replaced by a white and noticeably less lubricating version. Still, this is a good buy.    "

I have tried many conditioners over the years, and have found most of them leave a heavy residue on my hair that weighs it down.  Other conditioners seemingly did nothing, leaving it dry, fly-away and badly in need of styling product.  This one seems to have found that happy balance between heavy and light.Right now I am giving this product four stars, as I do not know how well it will perform over a period of several months.  Will a residue built up on my hair?  I just don\'t know yet.  Indications are positive, however.Pantene has a reputation for good products, so I am very hopeful that I have found a product that will serve me well for the long run.Update:  October 2010I am still loving this product.

The main thing that made me purchase it was that it had an indicator (on the clock/timer) that let you know if you were brushing your teeth too hard. I was told by my dentist to stop brushing so hard (slightly receeding gumline) and this toothbrush has helped me tremendously. My teeth have never felt more clean and I am no longer having sensitivity issues. It makes me feel like I have just had a cleaning at the dental office. It seems a bit pricey at first but I have always been able to find the brushheads cheaper than manual toothbrushes so it makes up for it in the long run. I highly recommend using the sensitive brushhead if you have sensitive teeth and receeding gums. This toothbrush is amazing, try it!"

896,476,486,20060211,B000BUUVTE,5,"February 11, 2006",A1OAN01CO11VIX,Best Razor Design,"I moved from a SensorExcel (2 blades) to this and this one is much better.I had a full face of hair (I hadn\'t shaved in about 4-5 days), enough to start a beard. One slow stroke across each section of skin with this razor was enough to clear out the hair with more precision than the SensorExcel could after 3 or 4 strokes.That is: a *new* SensorExcel blade in the same situation (4-5 days worth of hair) did worse and resulted in at least 3 cuts on average (whereas this blade resulted in no cuts). So clearly the new design helps. It does exactly what the ad says: spreads out the pressure of the cutting edges to reduce (eliminate in my case) the effect of your skin wrapping around the blade and causing cuts.But I believe you must use this blade SLOWLY. If you have the full face of hair like I did, that would be about 2 square inches per stroke, then wash. You can look into the blade and see very easily how full it is because with all those blades stacked so tightly together all the hair stays on the surface.This makes it easy to clean, too. Just run your thumb down the blades and you will easily unclog them. Compare this to the SensorExcel: once hairs were stuck in the abyss, they were usually there for good, requiring frequent blade changes. Hopefully this means the expensive blades will last longer (and thus prove to be worth the expense).This razor *is* an example of improvement via technology. I cannot agree that it is *revolutionary* but it is a good idea and it *is* the best razor design (I\'m comparing to double and triple razor designs, which I have used in the past). So it isn\'t the best on a revolutionary scale but it is the best.This razor\'s product execution was also an example of ridiculous marketing strategies gone over the top and if you want a laugh (or to be offended by the sheer obfuscation of information via distracting animations, interface, and sexual innuendo), I suggest checking out its website. The company could have made a greater profit had they foregone the ridiculously over-interfaced website because I doubt it convinced anyone. My first thought on entering was \'do I have to defeat the first boss before I can see their explanation for why a Power version of my razor is better?\' Along with the handle and cradle design, I would call it one of the most absurd and gaudy product executions I\'ve ever seen.However, the company luckily stumbled upon the best razor design in the process.

I\'ve used the fusion power for about three years and I\'ve been very happy, the blades stay sharp for a long time, they shave very close and don\'t leave terrible bumps anywhere you shave. I thought maybe the ProGlide blades would be even better, but they weren\'t. I\'ve never had a worse shave, the blades were dull as soon as they touched any hair. I would take a two blade disposable blade over the Fusion ProGlide. Don\'e ever get these blades as replacements, you\'re better off with the Fusion Power blades.    "

For an unassuming non-specialty brand, it delivers excellent cleaning properties and better performance than many of the specialized brands I\'ve tried. My scalp is very sensitive and I have a hard time finding shampoo that does not leave my scalp dry and itchy. This Pantene Pro-V leaves my hair feeling clean and does not dry out my scalp like many other brands, even ones that claim to be moisturizing.It is clear with no FD&C dyes, pleasantly-scented (floral) and produces a thick, sastifying lather. I am a male with short-medium length hair. A dollop the size of a quarter is all I needed to work into a rich foam that covers my entire head. One bottle should last me more than 6 months at this rate, making this product an excellent value. Highly recommended. "

Then it started to work for another 10 seconds and stopped again. The handle became warm after the second charging.I have called Oral-B\'s customer service this morning. They told me to charge toothbrush again.(Their argument is that when I was charging the unit, I was leaving it power \'on\'.) I did again with power \'off\' and this time it even does not function! The handle is become warmer!The toothbrush did not even touch the toothpaste!I know this problem may not be pervasive, but it indicates problems of the lower quality control of Oral-B and its unprofessional customer service. With these two serious problems, as to this power toothbrush model, I may not trust this brand anymore, unless they could provide me evidences to prove their high quality of their products.My recommendation is to try other brands or Oral-B\'s more advanced power toothbrush models.

However, there were a few issues I had.First off, it\'s a bit messy. You twist the bottom and sometimes it comes out, sometimes it doesn\'t.Sometimes you just have to keep twisting. Once you apply, if you put a shirt on right after, chances are it\'s going to get on the shirt.The first day I somehow got it on my hands after putting my shirt on and went to eat breakfast. Didn\'t taste very good.Secondly, when showering the next day it leaves an odd waxy residue that literally has to be rubbed off (it catches your finger).But I suppose that\'s why it\'s such a powerful antiperspirant and deodorant.Both are fairly non-issues, but are important to consider if looking at all of your options.If you can live with it being a bit messy, it\'s definitely a very powerful deodorant and antiperspirant.At the current discounted price it\'s around 4 bucks each in the pack of 6, which is a bit expensive-- but it\'ll definitely keep you fresh all day.

They give a great close shave & the blades don\'t get dull as quickly as most razors I\'ve tried.For a good shave, wash skin before shaving, then hold a HOT towel to the hair/skin area you\'re about to shave. That will soften the hair and open the pores.I also recommend Kiehl\'s brand \'Blue Eagle\' or \'White Eagle\' shaving cream. It\'s about $20 a jar but it\'s by far the best shaving cream I\'ve used. It\'s so thick you can even reshave each area many times without getting razor burn or irritation.Using cold water on the area after shaving will close the pores more quickly and help avoid razor bumps and dirty pores, etc...

My hair is very hard to manage. I have a combination of frizzy and staight hair. It\'s also very oily and thick. This conditioner makes the difference between a good hair day and bad hair day. I try not to use the same conditioner everytime I wash my hair, because I\'ve heard it\'s better to alternate, but I like this one so much, I find myself using it 99 percent of the time. It\'s especially good if you looking for something to give your hair more volume, without the frizz.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More "

I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Also, before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.    "

You know, when he gets the polisher out and rubs your teeth with it.  That is pretty much the same sensation you get with this brush.  I had to learn to not hold it against my teeth so hard because it was vibrating my entire head.I have to caveat.  I also own a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  To be honest, I think that the Sonicare feels better on my gums and also I think it does a better job overall.  HOWEVER, I hate my sonicare because of the way it grows mold.  The new sonicare models get your nasty toothpaste-spit mixture inside of the brush head where you can\'t see it growing mold.  Unless you actually unscrew the head and wash it out every day, and leave it taken apart to dry out, you will get mold inside your sonicare - and once that happens the brush pretty much smells like mold for the duration of its life (there may even be mold inside of the handle itself which I just cannot see without breaking it).This is not the case for the Oral-b Vitality.  The vitality features a snap-on type head which has no cracks to allow water to seep through.  The new sonicare features a flexible head, which I believe creates the problem with the mold (the old sonicares did not flex nor did they have the same mold problem).  The Viatlity head does not flex, it\'s just a straight snap-on piece with a rotating brush head at the top.Another thing I like about the Vitality is that it has changeable heads.  There are different heads which you can attach for different uses: Floss-Action, Pro White, and Dual Clean heads.  I use the Floss-Action and Pro White attachments - 2 minutes for each attachment.  The Floss action feels somewhat similar to a normal brush and gets all the stuff off your teeth, but the Pro-White has a weird yellow rubber thing in the middle of the bristles which rubs up against your teeth and whitens/polishes them.The Vitality also beats the sonicare in that it\'s brush heads come in packs of 3 for $20, whereas the sonicare offers packs of 2 for $20 (however, I believe the sonicare claims it lasts for 6 months and the vitality for 3).BATTERIES - the sonicare lasted about a month on a single charge - the Vitality only lasts about 2 weeks.That is all I can think of to put in this review.  The only reason I gave this brush 4 stars instead of five is because I wish it had more of a Sonicare vibration action - however it has an interesting rotating action which takes some getting used to.  The Vitality just doesn\'t feel like it cleans the gumline as well as the sonicare did - but at the same time it feels like it cleans the surface of the teeth better than the sonicare."

The lubrication strips are better than others I\'ve tried--you really don\'t need shaving cream or soap, and they last quite a while.The Venus has the added advantage of a holder that suction-cups to the shower wall, so you don\'t lose the razor.  So far it has stayed put.  Inside the holder is a spare blade, so if you decide it\'s time to change blades, you don\'t have to venture dripping from the shower to find a refill.Yeah, the blades are expensive.

You know those scenes in lowbrow comedies where a character finds out that they\'ve eaten something disgusting, and desperately try to clean out their mouth until they feel better? Yeah, the scene that followed was kind of like that.Maybe I missed something in the instructional booklet (and I DID read it,) but I had no idea I should be on the look-out for mold in such a random place in my toothbrush. A Google search has shown me that a lot of people have the same problem, and they fix it using things like bleach, hotel towels (\'Because it\'s too revolting to even use my own towels on it\') and an independently-created product that attempts to seal the stupid little hole.Personally, I\'m not going to use a hygiene product that can cause way more harm than good.

I mean, it\'s a toothbrush after all. WRONG. Once you\'ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you\'ll never go back.Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  Always have.  Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  However, I went ahead and gave it a try.In less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  I put on the toothpaste and away I went.  The best thing is the size of the rotating head: it\'s about the size of a tooth.  Gee: what a novel idea! As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  This allowed me to work on my teeth while moving towards my gums.  In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.One of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth. This was something I could NEVER do with a regular toothbrush.  I also have some very deep pockets in my gums that have a tendency to hurt and bleed. However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  Oral-b is a reliable brand and this is in keeping with the brand recognition.  I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  It\'s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera! ;)"

This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives. While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.Second thing to note, this shouldn\'t be a flossing replacement. You\'d think it\'d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely unnecessary.Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.So, with that, you\'d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right? Well, maybe not. For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn\'t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush. I don\'t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn\'t feel radically different from using a medium bristle brush.These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth clean.Finally, these heads seem to fit my teeth perfect, but I should note, I have a large mouth and large teeth. As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they\'d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/mouths.All in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone."

Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option. So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested. The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power. That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you\'ve ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your  shaver), you\'ll come to appreciate that gillette\'s blades can last a very long time. The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful. I\'d like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can\'t without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution. That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.Gillette probably hates customers like me. I use a cartridge for up to 6 months without replacement. Partly because I don\'t shave everyday (when you have a beard, skip a day and it\'s not really obvious). I\'m still on the first cartridge so I can\'t tell how dull it\'s become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it\'s 4 months now). Maybe I\'ll update this review when I change my first cartridge. :)Update: I\'ve changed cartridge/blades but only because the old blades look worn, but with the power on, it shaves as well as the new blade.

They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case).

The idea of 5 blades that are battery operated to vibrate in an orange handle seemed like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Very gimmicky and overkill and bordering on kitsch.  But rather than going through the hassle of returning them I popped in the battery after rolling my eyes at this corporate invented need and gave it a try.  As much as I wanted to hate it, I found it to be a definite notch up the shaving food chain.  The blades are very sharp and the vibration somehow seems to allow the head to glide more smoothly and evenly over the beard.  The shave and closeness were the best I\'ve ever experienced.  Even the single blade on the opposing edge for maneuvering in tight crevices like under the nose worked perfectly.  All this comes with a cost.  When I surfed over to see what the cartridges actually cost I was horrified.  Soon they\'ll need to be locked in a glass container at the grocery store with an armed guard in front of the display.  Second, not sure if it\'s planned obsolescence engineered into the cartridges, but the blades seem to last only a few shaves, making them even more costly.  The blades being mounted so close to each other also make them hard to rinse and they clog easily.  Buying in larger quantities lowers the cost per unit somewhat.  Personally, I\'m hoping beards come back into style to create some downward pricing pressure.    "

I purchased a M3 Power razor about a year ago and had little complaint with it, the biggest complaint I had was that the button on the handle was in a bad position, mainly the space that I like to grip the handle.Unfortunately, it seems, the new generation of Gillette suffers from even more problems than the previous generation. The button is still in that same godforsaken place. On top of that, the downstroke, or rather, the stroke with the grain is almost completely worthless. I will admit, it didn\'t grab the stubble or tear at my face, and it was a smooth stroke, exactly like the previous generation, but it left a horrendous amount of stubble. The cause of this I believe to be the huge blue buffer pad on the bottom edge of the blade. Even the new blade on the back end of the razor is practically useless. It cuts even worse than the ones on the front.The only positive thing I can say about this is the redesign of the handle. Unlike the M3 Power, you can use your index finger up higher on the handle if you so choose to but your continuously pressing against it and bumping the button.My conclusion would have to be that this is a subpar razor for a radically outragous price. $14 for the Razor, $14 for 4 replacements, and $30+ after tax for 8 replacements. It seems like Gillette was more concerned about getting as much money out of your pockets as they could than they were about designing a better razor. I will be returning to using the M3 Power, if only to save myself time whilst shaving.    "

While the packaging looks OEM, the quality of these heads is vastly inferior to ones purchased off the shelf at Target/CVS/etc.  The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  I\'ve used Oral-B electric brushes for over 10 years, and these heads behaved very differently.  After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!) during operation.  Also, I noticed that the \'blue indicator bristles\' never changed color at all after 8-12 weeks of use.  I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  I have noted other reviews echo these same problems.My opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...I am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product."

Ever since the original release, the blue ones, I rarely try other brands anymore.  The thing that I find a little unusual about the Moisturerich blades is how close they seem to resemble the Breeze blades which are some of my least favorite blades. The moisture gel feels slimy, and while that might switch to smooth after you rinse it away, it\'s not a lather and not at all pleasant while using it. Like the Breeze, the gel is used up rather quickly unlike the Embrace which lasts awhile.This isn\'t a bad a blade since it still shaves close and doesn\'t feel like you\'re scraping your skin, but the other blades just work better with less fuss.

Yeah, I remember. What a sensation! What a shave! What a waste of money. The expensive Mach 3 line has practically surpassed every razor out there in quality shaving and design. But it will never surpass the meaning of the word \'deal\'. And now, just a couple of years back, we were introduced to the Mach 3 TURBO, the special edition of a Mach 3 razor. Hmmm, silver all the way through. Shiny! Very dashing. Wow.....shaves well too, now that the three blades are coated to reduce friction. That\'s a relief! The razor has an evil price tag of about $11 canadian, and the razor cartridges go for about $10 for 4, or $19 for 8. I guess the Gillette head honchos needed a new fleet of \'Porsche Boxter\' convertibles and a few yachts. Well, if they get us to spend the money on their stuff, then we\'ll make them look richer than real estate dumbbell Tom Vu and Sly Stallone put together. I love a good, comfortable, gash free shave. And the Mach 3 is a terrific razor to get this wonderful shave I look forward to every morning. Mind you, the Mach 3 Turbo is just....well, too good of a razor. Kind of like an oversensitive Ferrari sport steering system. It\'ll get to every corner and turn...with scary precision. So, anti-friction coating or not, it\'s a serious blade. Yesterday, I went and bought the less expensive Schick Extreme 3, and even with it\'s three blades, it gives me a shave nearly as close as the Mach 3. Okay, so that\'s an A- shave, and not an A+. Still, the \'Extreme\' is a terrific razor, cuts the hairs well without leaving me the feeling that I have to be \'so\' careful with it, and is a much more reasonable price for both the razor and blade cartridges than the mighty Mach 3. Sigh. What\'s this world coming to? All this wasted money spent to find a razor that\'s a good price and gives you a great shave. Yeah....guess you could say that recently, I went to extremes. (groan) I know, I was never good at jokes.    "

This Pantene conditioner seemed worth trying.  It does prevent tangles and adds moisture, but I do find it hard to rinse out.  As others have commented, frequent washing is often the culprit in drying out curly hair and making it unmanageable, so this may be the trade-off with any curly hair maintenance regime.  Hair looks nice and maintains volume, but almost-daily washing is required because it apparently works by leaving residue on the hair. "

The Sensor Excel blades were the first among Gillette razors to add rubberized \'microfins\' at the bottom of the cartridges...a standard they have included on every Gillette produce since Excel\'s debut. But with so many razors brought to market since its rollout, how does Sensor Excel stand up to competition today?Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor Excel. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Excel cartridges are noticeably smaller than, say, Mach 3 cartridges (about 1/3 smaller). The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than most razor systems today. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are very easy to shave as a result.The shave: 4.5 stars. One can tell that this truly was Gillette\'s workhorse model for quite some time, and that a lot of research & development went into the creation of this system. The Sensor Excel offers a comfortable shave with minimal drag, leaving the user feeling clean and smooth. As stated above, the blade angle and smaller cartridge design allows for easy precision shaving of sideburns and moustache/goatee areas--an ideal choice for men who maintain those types of facial hair. It is noteworthy that, as a person with sensitive skin, I felt no facial sensitivity after shaving with the Sensor Excel--something that I cannot say about newer razors such as Quattro and Fusion. For those with sensitive skin, this would perhaps be a wise choice.Durability: 2.5 stars. This was where Sensor Excel disappointed me. I get, at most, three shaves out of one cartridge. Drag and other issues resulting from dull blades arose quickly after two to three shaves. It\'s safe to say Sensor Excel has been surpassed by newer razors that have better blade coatings. By comparison, during my testing of the Gillette Fusion I got almost two weeks out of one cartridge. However, with the steep cost of blades for newer razors, Sensor Excel may still be a more affordable option.Overall: A fine razor offering a no-frills kind of approach to shaving. No advertising or fancy marketing to deal with when it comes to Sensor Excel--just a razor that does what it\'s supposed to do, well. Durability comes into question here as newer razors offer better blade coatings, but still a smart choice for those who don\'t buy into (and don\'t need) the uber-bladed razor trend. Recommended.

After some experimentation I came to the conclusion that something like a sensor two-blade razor was basically as effective as other more expensive options with three or four blades on them. This cost savings is further multiplied by the fact that, in order to fit more blades on those other razors, the blades are made much thinner and are more prone to wearing out. So a sensor blade like these are much cheaper and seem to last longer.

Once I got over the shock of the gigantic sized cartridge, I was okay.What comes in the package:  One handle, one cartridge and a suction holder (which didn\'t stay suctioned anywhere in my bathroom).The handle: Is smooshy and has a soft gel-like grip.  I loved this.  It doesn\'t slip around in the shower and fits nicely in my hand.The cartridge: Did I mention this was huge?  I was trying to find a common object to compare it to.  I ended up using money. The cartridge is almost as wide as two quarters.  There is still portions on left uncovered above the quarters. The razor itself has 5 blades-nice.  On either side of the blade is an Olay bar-which is what makes this so huge.  I\'m assuming these will shrink with use.The shave: I was not brave enough to use this without soap on my legs.  I usually just squeeze shower cream into a bath puff and lather my legs. So, I don\'t use a thick lather...just enough to help the razor glide and not give me razor burn.  I did notice that there was an improved smoothness to the shave.  Even with my usual shower cream, there was not a big lather. For me, this is a plus. For others, the lack of shaving cream/gel thickness may take some getting used to.The shave was close. My skin was smooth afterwards.  It even did well under my arms.  Now, if you were to use this anywhere between your underarms and your legs, there may be issues since the cartridge is gigantic. This is a bummer.The cartridge refills run about five dollars each.  A bit pricy but if you are no longer buying shaving cream, the cost evens out.  The plus is that you can use the refills on any Venus handle (per the product description of the replacement cartridges).  However, this handle is better than the Venus handles I\'ve used in the past, but if you have a handle...it\'s nice to know you\'re not being forced to buy a new one. Brownie points for Gillette.The front of the package has a sticker guarantee that states \'Love it or 2x money back\'.  My final thought for this review is: If I would have paid for this product, would I take advantage of the guarantee?  My answer is no.  Although the size of the cartridge is what is keeping me from giving this 5 stars, the bars on the cartridge are superior to the nasty little sticky moisturizing strips on other razors.  The shave was good.  If purchased on sale, it would be an excellent buy.I will update my review to note how long the bars last on the one cartridge that I have (shaving every other day...down from my previous daily OCD shave).

Having to go through all 3 settings to turn it on/off is annoying.  It\'s definitely not like the Sonic and doesn\'t tolerate much pressure at all - making it difficult in tight spots as it just stops if it thinks there is too much pressure being applied when it isn\'t always about the pressure.  Gonna stick with Sonicare.

Gillette keeps inrocuding newer, more expensive razors.  The latest, Proglide Fusion has been so heavily disocunted that I deided to give it a try.  It is a perfectly fine razor once you get used to maneuvering the rather large head in tight spaces, like around your nose.For the first couple days, I shaved half my face with the old and the other half with the new and really couldn\'t see/feel much of a difference.  I continued to use the new one for about 3 weeks and then went back to the SENSOR.  It shaves every bit a well as the newer one and for about one third the cost for the new blades.  I rue the day when they stop making these blades.  This seems to be in the planning stages as they are now encouraging people to not buy MACH3 and switch to Proglide.  For what it\'s worth, I also prefer the SENSOR to the slightly pricier SENSOR EXCELL.    "

I decided on this model because it had the separate timer - something I had come to really miss on my older model. It had the timer on the handle only, making it impossible to check during operation. And while it buzzed after each 30-second segment was up, I often didn\'t really remember whether it had already buzzed to signal that the full two minutes had been reached and kept brushing longer than that.But it turned out that the separate timer on the Oral-B 5000 is all around tedious to operate. First, one has to remove the timer stand, then the battery cover because the buttons to set the timer are hidden underneath the cover. Whether this was a misguided attempt at keeping the design minimalist I don\'t know. But having to fumble with this already didn\'t work for me - I can\'t help but wonder: What were they thinking?In the end, the timer never worked anyway - it is set to demo mode when one takes it out of the box, and the buttons in the battery compartment also serve to set it up for regular operation. Trouble was that my timer could not be reset to normal operation. It kept cycling through demo mode time and again until I gave up and returned the whole thing.As to the toothbrush itself, it seemed to work great, just as I was used to from the previous model (and the only reason I gave this 3 stars at all). But since I had gotten this particular one because of the timer, I decided to order the 4000 model instead and just put up with the timer in the handle - at least I know this will work.One last word: My old Oral-B toothbrush came with a nice, very sturdy fabric case. This one in contrast has a rather flimsy plastic travel case. Another disappointment. My conclusion: Too expensive for what it offers."

In my mind, I couldn\'t imagine a more comfortable shave than what I was already getting with my Mach3.  Yesterday, I was at the store to buy a new Mach3 because my old handle had worn down over the years, and I finally decided to give one of Gilette\'s newer razors a try.I ended up getting a manual Fusion Proglide, and I was absolutely thrilled during my first shave with it this morning.  It was by far the best shave I have ever experienced!  The Proglide is so smooth, it hardly felt like there were any blades on the thing as I ran it over my skin.  It felt so nice, I am looking forward to using it again tomorrow morning (instead of waiting my usual two days).Unfortunately, although the razor package that comes with the handle is not much more expensive than some of the older Gilette razors, the replacement blades are noticeably more expensive.  I generally use my blades longer than most, but if you tend to run through new blades pretty quickly, using the Proglide may end up getting costly.  Regardless, I am now hooked on this thing already and will be sticking to this product.  For me, it\'s definitely worth the increased price, because I can\'t imagine having a better shave than what I experienced this morning!    "

That\'s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger.  It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference.  After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it\'s smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."

I don\'t like using serums because they involve combing my hair with my fingers to saturate each strand, leaving it stringy and flat once it dries. Detangling sprays are the way to go. I\'ve used a lot of different brands in the past, and really you can\'t go wrong with many of them. But this one is special because it\'s specifically for my hair type. My hair has never looked so curly before. I wash my hair, spray the detangler lightly (too heavy and your hair will look greasy within a few hours), distribute it with my fingers, and leave it to dry. It turns out perfect every time. Without it my hair is just a frizzy mess.The second ingredient is a silicone called amodimethicone. I\'ve heard some bad things about silicones, but I think people are just paranoid about cheap hair ingredients.

When I\'m at home, I like to shave with something that feels like it\'s built to last. After all, you don\'t drive a Power Wheels toy to work. HOWEVER, sometimes the need arises for a disposable razor...and when that time comes, consider reaching for a Gillette Good News razor.Aesthetics: 3 stars. There certainly isn\'t anything to look at on this razor. Lately, many of the big names (Fusion, Quattro) have been marketed in special colors and designs. This is plain razor with a plastic blue handle. The end. Yet, in its understated styling, it still has good features for a cheap disposable: pivoting head (non-pivot style available), lubrastrip, good blade angle.The shave: 4 stars. Yep, this thing ranks right up there with the big boys. It is a close and very comfortable shave. If you\'ve got sensitive skin (like me), the Good News performs quite nicely. It\'s a close shave without ripping a layer of skin off. Cuts are highly unlikely (unless the blade is dull, of course). The lubrastrip provides a small level of glide, but a good shaving cream/gel is recommended with this razor.Durability: 3 stars. I\'ve had disposables that lasted just one shave, others that last a week or more. This one is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack with regard to durability. I typically get three shaves out of a Good News razor.Conclusion: Good shave, ideal for people with sensitive skin. They don\'t last long, but the upside is that they are among the lowest-priced disposables on the market. Recommended.    "

I find myself wrapping my thumb around the handle to hold it while brushing and, sometimes inadvertently, hitting the Mode button. So, I\'ll be brushing in one mode and then the brush will switch to a different mode -- this makes me have to hit the Mode button 3-4 times to cycle back through to the mode I want to use. Again, this is my fault, but I also blame it on the design of the brush.2) I find the brush head bristles to be way too hard/harsh. I have these brush heads: Floss Action, Precision Clean and Pro White. I am going to buy the so-called Sensitive brush head and give it a try. If you have sensitive teeth/gums, like I do, then you may want to reconsider buying this brush or make sure you buy the Sensitive brush heads from the start.Other than these two \'flaws\', this is an awesome brush!"

The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  It\'s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  And children may find it more fun to use.How many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  Typical for Oral B\'s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn\'t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  Separate on and off buttons, are located on the handle.The Pulsar is being packaged and sold in various quantities.  At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B\'s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work."

971,551,571,20060905,B000BUUVTE,2,"September 5, 2006",A3J6GVLYFFCVGB,Not for thick beards,"Let\'s get this straight from the beginning:  I hate shaving.  I have a very thick beard that grows very fast -- if I shave first thing in the morning, I actually need a shave again by 5 o\'clock.  And I have to go over every area at least twice to get a close shave.  I spend an inordinate amount of time doing something that I hate.  So, I will gladly try any new product that promises to make shaving a bit easier.With five blades, the Fusion looked to be the holy grail of shaving.  I\'ve been using a Mach 3 for years, and it works better than just about anything else (though my Panasonic linear electric is great in its own right).  I figured if three blades are good, five should be better.  Right?Well, unfortunately not.  The five blades on the Fusion are on a head about the same size as the Mach 3, which only has three blades.  This means the blades on the Fusion are much closer together, which Gillette says will give you a closer shave.  This might be true for average beards, but if you have a thick beard, the blades are actually TOO close together.  I find that the Fusion just kind of skips over my whiskers without cutting, especially if I shave with the grain.  So, I actually have to spend a longer time shaving with the Fusion than I did with the Mach 3, and I have to go against the grain more often.  I\'ve switched back to the Mach 3.However, one thing I really do like on the Fusion is the single blade on the back.  That is really excellent for shaving those hard to reach areas under the nose, and for straightening out sideburns.  I just hope they come out with a Fusion Platinum Edition or something, with a bigger razor head that spreads the blades out a bit more.    "

I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn. Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head. I have been shaving my head for 10 years and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head, I couldn\'t believe how baby skin soft my head felt. Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head. I shave my head once a day and sometimes twice. On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times. I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried. I have had no razor burn or cuts with this Power Proglide razor.  I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush. I can honestly say that there is not too much difference with using these shaving gels/soaps with the Gillette Power Proglide.The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin. I can usually get about 5 complete head shaves (several times with the grain and against the grain) and beard shaves  with one razor before I need to replace it. The trimmer is quite helpful to trim around and outline my beard, goatee, mustache and even the occasional eyebrow. The only negative for this razor is the price.If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.    "

Until it dawned on me that I\'m still having gum problems so I switched to a new Periodontist who informed me that the Sonicare was tearing up all my gum grafts that were done.  He highly recommended the Oral B.  So I switched and what a huge difference.  It goes around the tooth which is what their instruments do at the dentist.  After using it for a almost 3 months, I can see a huge difference!  My gums and teeth feel clean but not all tore up.  I can\'t wait to go back to the Periodontist and show him the difference in my whole mouth.  The ORal B 5000 has a little digital clock that shows you when you\'re brushing too hard which has made a big difference in the way I brush and a 30 second timer to show you when to switch quadrants.  I\'ve always thought that really scrubbing my teeth was the way to go but not so! This brush shows you how to do it right.  I\'m excited about my new findings as I\'m spent so much time, money and pain in improving my gums. I feel for the first time, I\'m getting it right!"

Those are shaped more like a conventional toothbrush, rectangular,rather than round like this unit.  I always thought the Cross Action did a good enough job so I never splurged on a more expensive unit.  Well, after trying the Oral-b 3000, I find I like the 3000 much better.  I have less of a tendency to \'brush\' my teeth with the 3000, and I know you aren\'t supposed to brush with an electric toothbrush, just move the brush around slowly.  Being smaller in head size, it is easier to maneuver and I feel it does a better job getting  to all the teeth surfaces.  I love the added bonus of the 30 second timer on  the 3000.  At first I thought something was wrong when every 30 seconds it would seem like the toothbrush was powering down, but it just is a timer to let you know to move on.  It has a 2 minute timer so you can focus on doing 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  How fun is that!  The red \'too much pressure\' light is also handy, and I had to push pretty hard to get to light up, such that is was uncomfortable on my teeth.  Some of you may need the warning light, but the pain was enough for me to stop the pressure.  I do like this toothbrush, but I also agree that it is costly and buying replacement heads are costly, so it is a continuing investment.  Still, these clean so much better than manual toothbrushes.  My kids have been using them for years and between the two of them they have had 1 cavity.  So perhaps these do pay for themselves in the long run."

This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90% of the replacement blades, I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop (presumably glue) all over the blade, with the single blade missing! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems, as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet, and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality. I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke, but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades, I think it\'s time to call a spade a spade. I shave my head and my face both, and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors, and even with a fresh blade, many times it feels as though I\'m shaving my face/head with a sharp rock. needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase.

As women we have all probably figured out what our favorite brands are and what features we find best to suit our particular needs. I use light absorbency tampons which for some reason are rather difficult to find in retail stores, and when I do find them they are typically 2 times the price of others and there isn\'t ever a generic cheaper version. I purchased this 3 pack of 20 count tampons because there was a coupon offered at the time and with subscribe and save they ended up only being around 3 dollars a box. I have always liked the comfortable plastic applicator of the tampax \'pearl\' series, the compact style (1/2 the size of a regular applicator tampon) is such a wonderful feature, especially if carrying in your purse and they\'re small enough that you could inconspicuously tote one around in your pants pocket if need be. Just in case any of you aren\'t familiar with how the compact feature works...you remove the 1/2 sized tampon from the wrapper, hold the bottom textured part of the applicator, then simply pull out the base piece which will lock into place once completely pulled out (it aligns itself behind the cotton tampon inside) then viola you have a full sized tampon to use! Very convenient! I guess that\'s everything :) Reminder to you ladies out there...always remember to use the appropriate absorbency for your flow or you risk serious injury, even death form toxic shock.

After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up. Unfortunately i cannot tell you if they will last a long time since i just got mine about a week ago but i can tell you the difference between the two brands.The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you\'re not trying to, just when you\'re normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you\'re doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B\'s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i\'m brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B\'s. It\'s a bit annoying.The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy ine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They\'re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, but i\'ve yet to see how often they break. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They\'re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you\'re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain."

(2) when accidentally tapping the back of the brush on your tooth, it is not as \'jarring\'.  (3) auto-pause feature when applying too much pressure;  i have been over aggressive on the gums when brushing manually.*WHY YOU COULD LIVE WITH SERIES 1000:i bought this 5000 at a good price driven by an impulsive \'get the most expensive/best\' psyche.  honestly, (1) the timer is useless, i usually brush from 2-3 minutes regardless.

I have found this line of shampoos and conditioners not only gives me volume that looks like I have double the hair I actually have (you should see it tonight), but also improves the health of my hair, preventing and seemingly repairing breakage and split ends. I used to be plagued with split ends and now they are a thing of the past. I like this volumizing product because it enables me to do braids, thick ponytails and upswept styles with various accessories. My hair is also totally straight, so this product and other Pantene products have eliminated the need for a body perm. I will probably buy the product again.

As such, my review will not apply to men who want to know how it glides on the angles of their face, or how it trims the hair near their nose, etc.  Sorry.If you\'re a woman reading this - here\'s what you need to know:First of all, I\'m a teensy bit OCD when it comes to shaving my legs; I shave them every day and sometimes twice a day.  I know - it\'s stupid - I can\'t help it.  Anyway, I thought a power razor would be an easy way to do a quick shave when I\'m doing a 2nd shave of the day... so I wouldn\'t have to get in the shower a 2nd time.  I imagined that the reason for a power razor was that you could use it dry.  No.You still need wet skin to use this razor, and really - wet skin with some sort of lubricant (body wash, etc) is best.  I don\'t really understand why you need a vibrating \'power razor\' when you still have to have wet skin and shaving cream (or similar) to use it.  What is the advantage of the power?  Why not use a regular razor if you\'re doing all that anyway?  There\'s probably some reason that I don\'t get, and I\'m certainly not going to take away stars for my own ignorance, but I\'m just telling you in case you thought you could use this razor dry.As a razor in the shower, it shaves well.  The shave is close and smooth, with no nicks.  Personally I prefer the Schick Intuition since you can skip using the body wash with that (as it has it\'s own lubricating bar).  But this one shaves very well, and an advantage over the Intuition is that it has a \'floating\' head that goes over bumps like knees more easily and smoothly than a stationary blade like the Intuition.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the replacement heads are pretty pricey, and seem to get dull fairly quickly.BOTTOM LINE:  As long as you know what you\'re getting, it\'s a good comfortable razor that\'s easy to hold and shaves well.

I\'ve been a fan of oral B products ever since I was 18. I first bought the regular manual toothbrush and wasn\'t satisfied. I then bought the oral B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush, used it for about a month, and stopped. From then on I stayed using the man�al brush and was silent for about 3 years. This year I decided to give Oral B P.C. 5000 a shot. BOY o BOY, I cannot believe I didn\'t get this one earlier! When I first got it and after I took it out of the box, it was kinda confusing setting it up, and i� takes time getting used to it, but give it about 2 days you should have no problem. The Smart Monitor keeps you well-focused on which area you should brush. The brush heads that came with it are nice too. Mine came with the pro whitening heads and floss �ction. I\'m buying precission clean head soon. Overall it\'s easy to set up just give a little patience. I keep mine charging next to my bed on top of the dresser, sometimes I caught myself staring at it for a while because of how cool it looks :) Just to conclude and give you all a run-down of this amazing Electrical/rechargeable toothbrush:PRO:***Easy To Set Up***Smart Display Monitor that syncs with your tooth brush.  (Letting you know when and where to brush)***2 Brush Heads Included (Pro Whitening and�Floss Action)***Sleek Look***Nice Confortable Grip***Different Mode to Choose From. (Gentle,Whitening,Gum, and Deep Clean)***Wamning Indicator Lights Up if brushing too hard***Cool Little Station to put Brush Heads and to charge the handle.***Coupons ($15�off next dental visit and $3 off on brush heads purchase)***Makes brushing teeth exciting!CONS:***No Lighting signals, when chaging.  (For example: for SonicCare, when you charge the toohtbrush, the light  will turn orange. Green means its fully charged �nd Red means is low)But other than that this toothbrush is top notch!!!Like I said there\'s nothing better than Oral B 5000 PC SmartSeries.

In either case, the razor cannot be gripped too firmly because your leg IS going to hurt with a dry shave.  The lotion comes out of this razor on the second leg, and never in any quantity to be any help.For a quick shave, try some body lotion and a regular razor, but only if you have a little hair, and remember to lightly press.UPDATE:  It seems to work fine as long as you keep the razor totally satured with warm water and make sure you use a light touch.  I also put lotion on my leg before shaving because of the bad stinging that happened once after shaving.Works for a quick shave if you\'re not looking for perfection.    "

Cuts my skin, not a close shave, requires too much pressure to bring blades in contact with skin.","I recently discovered Gillette\'s Venus line of razors (I know, they\'ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite). Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \'what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel so I don\'t have to lather up my skin?\'. Apparently, something other than these Venus Spa refills with the shave gel built in.I don\'t know; maybe I just got a bad batch of razor cartridges, but the one that I opened up doesn\'t really release any shave gel until I\'ve moved well beyond a leg or forearm or two. When it DOES release that gel, it\'s more as a concentrated, thin \'string\' of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair. Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger\'s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor\'s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \'lips\' to get the \'teeth\' to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it\'s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades. Just not well executed.I\'d read all of the reviews for the single packs of Venus Spa cartridges, so I knew that there\'d be a 50/50 shot that I\'d actually like these, but putting them into use for myself solidified it for me. You shouldn\'t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that\'s what I feel like I need to get these to work right. As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I\'ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges. At this rate, I\'d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much. THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference. THESE razor cartridges? Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o\'clock shadow every day, and I didn\'t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble! If you like one of Gillette\'s other types of Venus cartridges, stick with those. As has been proven to me before, the grass ISN\'T always greener on the other side! And the stubble may actually be longer!    "

While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.ADVANTAGES:Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It\'s not the most powerful brush I\'ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.DISADVANTAGES:Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it\'s nice to have the option and this one does not.Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it\'s power would rate 3 stars.OTHER COMMENTS:Does it whiten teeth?  It\'s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.

It is very easy not to brush your teeth long enough especially if you are in a hurry.  The timer doesn\'t allow this to happen.Now, some extra PROs:Previously I was a diehard Philips Sonicare user for many years.  But, I was having some problems with my gums and deep plaque buildup.  I finally decided that there must be something better and more effective.  After much research online and with my dentist\'s input, I decided on the Oral-B.  I absolutely love the deep cleaning feature and brush head.  Actually, I never use any other head or brushing strength other than the deep cleaning mode and brush head.  The brush head has numerous styles of bristles that accomplish different things from deep cleaning, removing plaque, cleaning between teeth, massaging gums, etc.  You couldn\'t give me my Philips Sonicare back.My original hesitance was the price.  But, it was worth the money considering I only have one set of teeth and gums.One minor CON:  The user manual was not written to be user friendly.  It does a poor job of explaining how to set the Smart Guide Clock features.  Just be prepared to read it carefully and keep it nearby for a few days.  When you consider all of the awesome features, the user manual is not worth losing a start or a half star."

After using the blade wipe it off on a towel and then cover the blade with a few cotton balls held in place by a rubber band. Then put the shaver in your sink drawer. You can easily have 3 weeks of use with this method. The reason why people\'s blades wear out in a week is because they dont dry off the blade and they leave it next to the sink.

One wouldn\'t expect them to last for months, but more than a 2-3 showers seems reasonable at this price point. The blades themselves are good, though, and last considerably longer after the moisture bars have worn down, so it can still be effectively used with shaving lotion -- which, of course, defeats the point of this skip-a-step design. I gave it 4 stars anyway because it *does* -- for the first shave or two -- do as promised, give you a simple nick-free shaving experience without using any additional gel/lotion/cream. Also be aware that they\'re superior to \'normal\' razors primarily just on long, smooth planes of skin, like legs or forearms. In smaller or less flat areas the moisture blades may not actually be able to make contact with your skin because, by necessity, they do not sit exactly flush with the razor blades.

The razors were ordinary razors, from Gillette. Those razors don\'t come into this tale. But attached to the outside of the pack of ordinary razors was one special razor, a sample of another razor model. This is its story.At first, the special razor lay in the bathroom drawer, watching as ordinary razors were used and thrown away, used and thrown away. It was a lonely existence as the only one of its kind. No bright colors or fancy features made this razor stand out from the crowd. Razors came and razors went as the tough-bearded man shaved his sensitive face.Then one day it was the special razor\'s turn.The first shave was fine, a nice close shave that didn\'t sting that sensitive face. It might even have ended that day, if the rough-bearded man had thrown the special razor in the trash. But he didn\'t, for he was frugal too.The second shave was fine as well.And the third. Unusual, thought the rough-bearded man.But the fourth time he shaved his sensitive face with the special razor is when he began to suspect that this razor was special, indeed. What razor stays sharp for four shaves? And a disposable too! The man felt his smooth skin and wondered if it could be. He set the razor aside just in case, on the slimmest hopes there could be another smooth shave. How wonderful, how magical that would be!The next day came, as they always do. And the rough-bearded man lifted the special razor to his sensitive face. And shaved.No pulling! No stinging! A smooth and silky shave! It was all true. Then the rough-bearded man knew that this was not merely a special razor. Nay, this was indeed -- a Magic Razor!He asked the razor its name. The razor said, \'Gillette Custom Plus 3 Sensitive\'.The rough-bearded man with the sensitive face smiled a wide smile with his smooth skin. Some say the razor smiled too.The End    "

It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.    "

From the first time I brushed with this Oral B 5000, I was astonished at how clean my teeth felt.  I honestly think they felt even cleaner than when I would have them cleaned at the dentist.  I even find myself brushing a third time some days, just for the great feeling.  My only disappointment with the unit is that I didn\'t clearly understand it only came with one brush head.  My husband utilized that Floss Head while I waited a few days for our set of 4 Precision Clean Brush Heads came in.  (I think that the floss head would have been too large for my mouth, so I did not order those for us.)  Using the simple Precision Clean heads, my mouth feels terrific.  While I have had gum problems in the past, I find less bleeding with this brush than my manual toothbrush which I had been using.  As some others have noted, my teeth are markedly whiter in perhaps only a week of use, with my usual whitening toothpaste I will add.  I do like the little remote timer.  I thought it more for my kids, but I truly like seeing the time rack up.  I now think I will be using the Deep Cleaning (3 minute) setting as I am never quite done with each quadrant before it beeps and pauses to alert me.  I am unsure how the whitening (pulsing mode) helps, but I use it after a full brushing, and it certainly isn\'t hurting.  My family of four is now happily using this unit.

The Fusion  has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days\' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade.

I can tell you that the blades, though expensive, last a long time for me.  I have moderately tough facial hair.  The old disposable razors gave me a few days of shaving and they were history.  I have shaved up to two months with these razors and still got a good shave.I have read that there are controversies about the value of three blades.  I think the three blades help keep the razor at the optimum angle on my face for shaving.  I do get a pretty good shave as well.  I do use Edge Advanced Shave Gel in combination with my Gillette Mach3, which may help get me a better shave.Most men in the United States shave, whether we like it or not.  The Gillette Mach3 gives me the best and most consistent shave I have ever had.  Until I find a better razor, the Mach3 is the one for me.Enjoy!    "

I got mine as a Christmas Present 2 years ago.  It took me just over 4 months to use the three cartridges that came with it.  There is no downside.  It was both the best shave, as well as the most economical one I had ever experienced.  I admit that I was a little taken back by the cost when I finally ventured out in the spring to buy some replacements.  Around here they either lock them away in some little Fort Knox in the store, or even enclose them in security boxes that sound an alarm if you try to open it or run out the door.  I can only imagine that too many men, (and some women too) have considered larceny over cheaper blades if they can\'t afford the fusions.  The fusion cartridges may be a little steep, but the truth is 8 of them in a pack can easily get your average Joe through an entire year of shaving. Here on Amazon, I got 8 refills for $20 and free shipping!  That\'s not only a good $5.00 cheaper than the best place here, but that\'s not including the savings on the sales tax.  Believe me when I tell you that I spent over an hour one night searching for replacement blades online and finally settled on Amazon as unbeatable.  Nobody even came close with the free shipping.  If you\'re not already a Gillette fusion shaver, become one.  If you are, buy the cartridges here.  Amazon not only has the best price for them but it is actually easier and more convenient to buy here.  You will never be tempted to resort to larceny....    "

They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn\'t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades?

But when I brushed with it this morning I was really surprised by how much better this handle is from the 3D Excel. I also realized why I have been using electric toothbrushes; manual toothbrushes do not even come close. It felt like I went to the dentist. Absolutely worth the $50 I paid (after mail in rebate) including shipping. I still think the wireless display (Smart Guide) is a marketing gimmick, but I may be proven wrong over the next several weeks of use.I have not used the 3000, 4000 series or the Sonicare, but I would definitely recommend this over the 3D Excel handle and definitely over manual toothbrushes."

But thanks to the new Pantene Medium-Thick Hair solutions line, we finally have our own choices in hair care!I have very thick, long hair. I grow it out over several years and then have it all cut off and donate it to Locks-for-Love (an organization which makes human hair wigs for children with medical conditions who have lost their own hair). But just because I donate my hair doesn\'t mean I don\'t also want it to look great while I\'m still using it. :)Like many other people I dye my hair, curl it, flat iron it, style it, blow-dry it, and sometimes just like to put it up in a hair clip. I have always been in need of a shampoo and conditioner that was made for those with thick hair, and Pantene has finally created it!This Pantene Pro-V Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner (and the shampoo from the same line) work wonders for making my hair super soft and manageable. It calms the straggler hairs yet still allows hair to be manageable for styling with curling irons without going flat. It gives hair just a touch of shine, but in no way makes it greasy. The scent is not overpowering in any way, and it makes hair so soft you can brush right through it while soaking wet.This 33.80 oz bottle is HUGE. I had no idea exactly how large it was until it came. This is not the bottle you find on the shelves of your local grocery store or Wal-Mart/Target. This is Sams Club/Costco size. It\'s about as long as a loaf of bread! This bottle is over 2 lbs of conditioner, so even those of us with a lot of hair will find it takes a long while to use it all.* * * This is NOT a line for those with thin or fine hair * * *I always end up seeing posts/reviews from those who say they have thin/fine hair and shampoos/conditioners like this make their hair limp and lifeless. Yes, if you have hair that you would consider \'thin\' or \'fine\', this will just weight it down. This line is made for those who have an abundance of hair and are wanting to get it smooth, soft and under control. Please check out one of the other lines for those hair types. This is not the one your looking for.If your hair is long, thick, poofy, coarse, or any other variation of these, I highly recommend trying the Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions line. It\'s the best line of hair care I have found that offers products for these hair types. Now even those of us with long, thick boring hair can have a mane that looks phenomenal! "

I figured this was just an attempt to sell us something all us fusion owners already had and my suspicion was furthered by other reviews posted here, which said the proglide was not much of an improvement over the fusion. But I decided to try it as I love new toys and though I really like the fusion I don\'t think it is perfect as occasionally it does give me razor burn. So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion. I don\'t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced. Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn\'t think it was perfect. But the proglide is so good I\'m not sure what the next step in shaving evolution will be as I feel this is as good as it gets. Definitely worth the $11 or so to switch from the fusion    "

If you have sensitive teeth this brush is still good just do not use a toothpaste with SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) OR use a sensitive toothpaste like Sensodyne.

Too Pricey for What it Does, Though","I have SLE and sjogren\'s (another autoimmune disease that has pretty much destroyed my salivary glands).  I do not have enough spit in my mouth, which leaves my gums fragile and my teeth prone to cavities - even in the front.  My dentist is great and is working with me to save my teeth and gums, but I have to stay on top of things.I have been using a sonicare for a couple of years.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The sonic waves sort of pummel out the junk between my teeth and loosen it up even places that the toothbrush cannot physically go.  However, that brush brutalizes my gums and the sonic action sprays stuff everywhere - my sink and mirror look like a crime scene after I brush.  The Oral-b 3000 cleans physically only - no sonic stuff, so it only gets the stuff the bristles can get to.  That amounts to teeth that are slightly less clean in spots than what I get from the other brush.  However, my gums barely bleed at all when I use this on the sensitive setting.If your main concern is gum disease, and you\'re a good flosser, I would recommend this over the sonicare, because you\'ll be able to massage your gumline without damaging good tissue.  Press the start button twice for the sensitive setting, and you\'re good to go.I deducted one star for the price point.  I think a brush this expensive ought to include sonic technology.  Sonicare has the essence for $40 less than today\'s price for the oral-b 3000,  but if you need a decent brush that will not hurt your gums, this is probably worth the added expense.  I give it an 8.5.  It cleans better than the lower-priced oral-b products - almost as well as the sonicare.  The sensitive setting is a really nice feature for people like me with fragile gums. And replacement heads are affordable - much less expensive than the sonicare."

That aside the problem with this pad is that while designedfor heavy flow, it actually is not a good pad to depend upon when you have heavy flow. The fatal flaw is that all liquid hits the pad at a specific spot, but goes under what you can visibly see. So in other words, when you check the panit may seem as though there is only a little bit of fluid. However, once you remove the pad you seethat all of the fluid is kept away from sight under the initial layer of cotton. The reason this isproblematic is that it interfere with your ability to correctly judge when the pad is actually FULL.And if you misjudge that, the pad will overflow!Typically all other pads you can visible see how much fluid is on it  and can easily determine when itneeds to be changed. But with infinity, while it may hold a lot, it\'s to scary to trust. To get an accurate understanding of how full the pad actually is, you need to look at the back. I think thispad is best used for average flow. and heavy flow should be left to any other pads in their line thatdon\'t use this \'hide the fluid\' technology."

Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  The icing on the cake is the low price of this brush. Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  This is an excellent product. 4.5 Stars*** Positive Points: ***- Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)- Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3). The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).- It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base. You simply stick the raised portion of the charger into the end of the brush.- Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries- Brush vibrates to let you know when you have gone over the recommended 2 minute brush time.- 2 year warranty*** Negative Points: ***- Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.- There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.- The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouthOverall:  This toothbrush cannot be beat for its price.  I deducted half a star because there is no indicator light telling you the battery status, though this is a minor issue."

While I have been blessed with a cavity free mouth, I still hate enduring the scrape of the dentist\'s tools against my teeth. And I know it\'s just a matter of time until the dentist breaks out his drill...It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  You can probably chalk it up to \'user error\'....  I wasn\'t brushing properly, nor long enough to really keep a clean mouth.I did a bunch of research on electric toothbrushes to see what the fuss was about. Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  hmmm...  more research led me to this model - the motorized head rotates in the recommended pattern and the handle buzzes/vibrates in 30 or 45 second intervals to help you judge the brushing time of each section of your mouth.  Recommended time is 30 seconds per quadrant.  But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn\'t enough for me.  What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up) the amount of time you have been brushing.  If you look at the picture of the box, you can see the digital display, it\'s a little bit bigger than a business card, and about an inch thick.  As you are brushing, the display will track the quadrant you are brushing, and when your brush handle buzzes, the digital display will move to the next quadrant - giving you a visual que to move on to the next section of your mouth. It will even tell you if you\'re brushing too hard! When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds... the smiley face will wink at you!  :  It\'s a flirty toothbrush!My husband and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  We absolutely love them.  We recieved them two days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.  I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn\'t a big deal. I never have to wonder if I\'m brushing properly or if I\'m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \'fresh from the dentist\' clean mouth.  The handle holds its\' charge for a long time, I can brush for 2 1/2 minutes twice a day, for 9 days before having to recharge - however, I usually keep the brush handle in the charger when it\'s not in use.I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  The travel case is a hard, sturdy plastic to protect the brush handle, and the detachable brush.  It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly. My toothbrush will never again travel in a ziploc baggie.  :) Yay!I did have a little bit of sticker shock when I purchased two of these at the same time, and then again when I saw the cost of replacement brush heads.  But I feel like I am taking good care of my teeth, and I know my next dentist appointment will be less stressful.  Also - I know P&G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time. This makes me feel like I\'ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  Plus P&G offers coupons on their website all the time, so I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.This model isn\'t just an electric toothbrush - It\'s quality control for your mouth!  I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  Happy Brushing."

Of course, like a fish attracted by something shiny I hopped on the internet to take a look at electric toothbrushes. I probably spent 5 hours reading everything I could on these. A lot of people were talking about the one that has a UV cleaner in it. I call gimmick. Anyways, I ended up with this one and was extremely skeptical.1. The timer is separate from the brush and sits on your counter and has a picture of a smiling tooth on it, kind of hard not to feel like this is a joke2. What the heck, charged this puppy up and waited till after dinner3. Initiate brushing sequence4. Having the handle buzz after 30 seconds to let you know to move to a new quadrant and having it show on the timer is very useful. It makes it seem like it is going by really fast.5. If you brush too hard the handle stops pulsating till you back off. I literally put the brush head on each tooth and just move down, not really doing any real brushing but just letting the vibrations do the work.6. After I spit and rinsed out my mouth, it literally felt like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. They stay smooth almost the entire day depending on what you eat.This was $$$ well spent in my opinion. I highly recommend getting one of these. Don\'t forget, you are supposed to change your brush head every 3 months or so. Might want to price that into your purchase."

The little rubbery fins seem to keep the head moving at a good pace with no problems so far.  It is flat and hugs the skin well and seems to rotate well without difficulty.I will keep using it and testing it, but I am not sure how expensive the replacement blades are- that is often the problem.  So many times the replacement blades are more expensive than the original razor or close to it.The handle was easy to hold on to despite soapy wet hands.  The wall unit  stayed up well so far on my fiberglass shower wall- it has two suction cups which seems a bit better than other ones I have tried with only one.The extra blade pack stores inside which I like, although it has to be cut into with scissors to get at it, so having it in the shower helps to keep track of it, but not for opening when needed.  You have to get out of the shower to open it.All in all I really like this razor so far- I have used it twice on my legs and it has stayed sharp and effective, but I will edit if I can in the future to reflect any changes in my opinion of this as time goes on.

I hated shaving every other day as I found the shave quite uncomfortable. But with my ever increasing stubble, I wanted to find an alternative.I found this one at Kroeger and decided to give it a try. I was very impressed with the shave, it was very smooth and much more comfortable than any two blade razor. What was most impressive was it cut far less than the other razors. The turbo option doesnt really improve the shaving experience though and so I shave without the turbo power. I do have to shave on the same spots again but I do not feel any discomfort as compared to the other razors. The trimming blade too is useful especially when working on the sideburns and underneath the neck, but it takes some time to figure out the \'correct\' way of holding the handle in this position.But alas, all good things have a price and this one might be too expensive in the long run. I will have to see how many shaves my blades last to get the economics right.In short, if you are still stuck with two blades and want to move to better options, I highly recommend this razor if you can afford the blades in the long run.

Your Oral B toothbrush was meant to be used with Oral B heads. The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand. As far as the advertised \'Pro White\', I cannot attest to that.

These toothbrushes also feature  electronics that keep the motor voltage constant - and hence maintain optimal orbital brushing speed - even as the battery voltage declines as they discharge. So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops. So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries! This feature also means despite the lower voltage of using 2x 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, you get the same brushing speed and power as using 2x 1.5V Alkaline cells. This is great! as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.Build quality of the units is great as you\'d expect for a Braun, even for a cheaper unit. The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section. This guarantees moisture vapour can\'t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term service.The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can\'t get into the internals.The 2-minute timer is a nice feature. At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing but if you wan\'t to keep brushing, you can as it doesnt turn the motor off.Overall this brush is great, especially for the price. The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific. The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber. All these problems are remedied with this Braun model."

I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.While I have no complaints about its power, the fact that it utilizes two cleaning brushes gives it a much larger brushing surface than with the single brush found on my Soniccare.  While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist."

The toothbrush works well, is well designed, and seems very durable so I\'m pleased.  I wasn\'t sure if a hundred dollar toothbrush was for me, as I was in the practice of using a regular toothbrush for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time (while I surfed the net, usually), so I thought I was doing ok.  Let me tell you, this Oral-B feels AWESOME and it really makes my mouth feel cleaner in a shorter period of time!  I tried using my old toothbrush again, just to see, and it didn\'t feel right.  I\'ll never go back!!I usually use the regular (30 seconds per quadrant) clean in the morning and the extended (45 seconds per quadrant) clean at night.  After the last alert goes off I usually spend about another minute or so hitting the tongue, roof and cheeks, as well as a quick run around the base of the teeth and gums.  Feels great!As far as cleaning the brush, I let it run for a little under running water, then I remove the brush head and rinse the inside.  I then dry both using a towel, then keep them separate to air-dry a little more.  So far that keeps me from worrying about stuff growing inside or anything like that."

Personally I\'m glad she got the thing on discount. It\'s no better than the M3 Power razor I have. The difference in closeness of a shave was minimal to nonexistant, more closely bordering the latter I\'m afraid. On top of which, the new head design renders shaving with the grain, or the downstroke, completely useless. And the detail trimmer on the back of the head is dull and useless right out of the packaging.The single improvement this razor has over the last generation is that the handle of the blade is more comfortable in the hand and balanced better. The downstroke is useless, the upstroke is the shave. The total shave is overall the same except that I can\'t use the downstroke at all anymore. And at the jacked up price they\'re pumping out these beauties at, it\'s not worth anything at all. I\'ll stick with my M3 Power. Sorry Gillette. Your new thing just ain\'t the best a man can get.

4681,1508,1543,20090924,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 24, 2009",A1OZA52DFY3SHD,"Good for your teeth, better for your gums","The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great product at a pretty good price, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s perfect.I\'ve been using an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush for about 4 years now and I really like it.  The Oral-B Professionals have the circular brush head and work differently than the Pulsonic or Philips\'s Sonicare toothbrushes.  Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I\'m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.The Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  It\'s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  The brush head of the Pulsonic is a breeze to take on and off; you slide it onto the unit and then give it a quarter-twist.  The brush head locks into place.  I hate how the brush head gets stuck on my Professional model, so this is a big advantage of the Pulsonic.  The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there\'s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  When it\'s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional\'s circular head.  The Pulsonic assists in cleaning by sending out sonic pulses, similar to a jewelry sonication cleaner.  This is used to blast off debris and break up bacteria biofilms that are populating your teeth and gums.  The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  Here\'s where I feel is the key difference that should determine which type of toothbrush you should get.  I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  The Pulsonic requires you to make tiny circular motions over your teeth and assists your cleaning with the sonic vibrations.  The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don\'t get me wrong, it\'s much better than a manual toothbrush.  But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  I\'ve never had a cavity, but the dentist always complains that my gums are a little too puffy or too red.  After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  I don\'t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.The other thing I\'ll mention about the Pulsonic is the base.  The base has a small footprint size and the Pulsonic simply rests in a small hole in the base.  It\'s a bit wobbly, but it works alright.  The problem I have, however, is that there are only two spots for brush heads.  The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have their own brush head(s) it\'s an annoying inconvenience.So I think the choice is up to your specific needs.  If you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush and commonly have cavity problems, then maybe you want to go with one of the high-end Oral-B models that have a circular head.  If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I\'d recommend the Pulsonic.  I\'m not a dentist, so that\'s just my opinion.  For my needs, though, I\'ll be sticking with the Pulsonic.UPDATE:I went to the dentist recently for my standard 6-month check-up.  I\'ve never had cavity problems before, but the dentist had always warned me that my gums and gum pockets were borderline beginning to show problems.  Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  While the hygienist was cleaning my teeth she asked, \'do you use an electric toothbrush?\'  When I replied yes, she said, \'yeah, I can tell.\'  So, there ya go.  I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they\'ve been in in years.  With that, I\'ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush."

Overall I think it works very well.I bought it about a month after my previous (2-3X the price) electric brush broke, so I\'d been using a manual brush for a bit. After a week of using the Pulsonic my teeth were noticeably whiter and have gotten whiter since then. I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past- my soda drinking youth eventually caught up with me I guess:(. I\'ve had this brush for a year and my dentist says my teeth and gums are in great shape.My only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn\'t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right? If you\'re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don\'t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic."

Make sure it\'s fully charged before first use and every full charge will last you at least a week depending on how often you brush.I think it\'s a very good investment for your dental hygiene and replacement heads dont seem to be too costly if you buy it from Amazon as well or go to Costco or BJ\'s to get them at a slightly lower price than retail stores.

It\'s not that I didn\'t brush after every meal when I was doing it manually; it\'s that these toothbrushes do a significantly better job. Furthermore, although their use has never actually whitened my teeth, it slows down the degree of stain accumulation from tea, coffee, etc., so that I do not have to bleach my teeth as often.Having said all that: This model does not work any better than my trusty Oral-B S-200. It also has the same drawback, that the rechargeable batteries do not last forever and when they give out, you must buy a whole new unit. When in use, the toothbrush sounds louder than the S-200 and different, resembling a dentist\'s drill.  For anyone thinking of using older heads they have around, my S-200 heads do not fit on this model--the shaft is different. The brushes themselves are round instead of the traditional oval--I can\'t see any advantage to that but perhaps a dentist can.Is this toothbrush worth using?  Absolutely.

Design, power indicator, its power which seems to be more powerful than the M3, the aloe strip and the extra blade on the back of it! BUT, this thing has one blade too many in the front, this razor WILL CUT YOU if you are not careful! You could probably kill someone with it! The blades on the cartridges are extremely sharp and shaving time increases to over twice the time as with the Gillette M3, due to that extra fourth blade and the size of the cartridge, which forces you to be extra careful and shave very slowly, so as not to cut yourself. If it only had one less blade in the front, it would certainly be the best razor in the world! Gillette, if you are reading this, consider this advise seriously and remove that fourth blade, because you created one hell of a scalpel. I am rating it two stars, despite the many pluses already mentioned, but since its primary and only purpose is to shave, I cannot honestly say it does a good job. I\'ve used disposable razors that are about $0.49 cents that are faster and better. I do not recommend it, unless they remove that fourth blade.

The biggest problem with long curly hair, besides women telling me it isn\'t fair for a guy to have curls when they don\'t (only heard this about two million times over the last four decades), is that it can be an ordeal to get a comb through after a few days without washing, such as backcountry hiking, etc.Enter Pantene conditioners. I just started using them a few months ago, so this one for curly hair is right up my alley. I am normally one of those weirdos who uses as much organic stuff as possible, both food and other stuff such as shampoos, toothpaste, etc. I just don\'t like putting manmade chemicals on my body or in the environment. But this stuff is so efficient that I need only a tiny bit to do all my hair, less than half compared to the Nature\'s Gate Organics I normally use. Plus, it detangles the biggest mess of knots in seconds! I swear, it takes me ten minutes of careful slow work to get a comb through with almost every other conditioner when me locks is all dreaded up, but this stuff somehow detangles them in no time flat.It\'s almost a miracle! For that kind of performance and efficiency, I\'ll deal with a few chemical components, especially as it takes so little of this stuff to do the trick. I still use my organic stuff more than half the time, but switching it up with this Pantene is working great for those times when I\'m in a hurry, or my hair is so knotty that I\'ll pull out big clumps while trying to detangle it.In short: if you have long, curly hair that often tangles, I haven\'t found a better conditioner that will detangle hair quicker, and with less product needed, than this stuff. Plus, it\'s really pretty cheap at 5 clams for a big bottle, which will last you dozens of uses. Very fairly priced indeed.Zero complaints from me about this stuff.Highly recommended."

Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies.  The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing.  They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry.  I can get more than a month of shaves out of a single cartridge before the blades dull and start to nick or pull at the skin.  Buying a 12-pack of blades lasts me longer than a year . . .    "

The Pantene curly hair series conditioner doesn\'t condition my dry ends as much as other conditioners do, but at the same time it didn\'t make it worse as some products have, so I can\'t really complain.The conditioner is quite clingy in the shower, meaning it\'s really hard to massage into the entire length of my hair.  It wants to say where it was first applied, which is quite odd.  It rinses clean and smells nice.  I don\'t use more of it than I do any of Pantene\'s conditioners.When I use the conditioner and just let my hair air dry without product, my hair becomes what I suppose could be called \'curlier.\'  In fact, it\'s as though my hair gets separated out into a series of almost ringlet-like strands.  However, it\'s frizzy, and when I comb through my hair it loses those ringlet things and just becomes a fuzzy bunch of waves.  It is easily tamed by some (other brand) of mild leave-in conditioner and/or spray curl enhancer.  In comparison, I have some Pantene conditioner for dyed hair from their previous series and, while it doesn\'t leave my hair in those ringlet-curls, it also doesn\'t leave my hair frizzy either.When I use the curly hair series conditioner with product in my hair and let it air dry, the hair avoids the ringlet look and turns into what\'s more of an 80s perm, but not frizzy at all.  Combing it out produces a pretty nice series of controlled waves, but there is a tendency to frizz during the day.  Again comparing it with the Pantene conditioner for color-treated hair, it works about the same but provides more controlled waves than the color-treated version does.In all, I personally wouldn\'t buy the curl series conditioner.  Actually, I\'m not sure if I\'d buy any of their product as their current line exists.  See, I\'ve used many Pantene products over the years, and years ago I used Pantene curl products and liked them.  The conditioner was much better than this version; however, Pantene reformulates and repackages their products every few years, which not only means you lose the type of Pantene you liked to use, but also that it\'s hard to stick with Pantene as an overall brand.  I did (and do) continue to use Pantene, always buying whatever series had stronger conditioning than their ever-present Classic Care line.However, with this new series there is no high-conditioning product.  Right now they have Classic Care as they always do, plus curly, color treated, fine hair, medium-thick hair... well, my hair is 3 out of those 4, which do I choose?  I suspect everyone\'s hair falls into more than one of Pantene\'s categories.  It\'s possible there isn\'t a product in their current line-up for me to use, which means I\'ll have to wait 2-3 years until they reformulate yet again. "

It comes with three toothbrush heads: sensitive, floss, whitening. The sensitive brushhead one will forever remain in the closet. Really unless you have someone in your family who has different teeth from you, either you will be using the floss or the sensitive, not both, so really it comes with two brushheads, not three.2. It took me a while to read the manual, I didn\'t think it was all that clear on what I was supposed to do (I\'ve never owned one before) but it turns out that it\'s a lot easier than the manual suggests.3. I\'m not certain if the pressure signal works appropriately. After starting to use it, my teeth started to become more sensitive. Even though the timer thing didn\'t indicate I was brushing too hard, I decided to use less pressure and my teeth stopped being as sensitive.4. It doesn\'t tell me anything about usage of toothpaste.

Then I tried the Venus Embrace Razor.  I will never go back to my original razor choice again.First thing I noticed was how the Venus 5-blade razor with its ribbon of moisture \'zipped\' across my skin and removed all the hair smoothly, easily, quickly, and completely on the first stroke every time.  I had not even realized the \'drag\' I was experiencing with my original razor choice until I felt how smoothly the Venus razor did its work. I had just shaved my legs the previous day, but my razor had \'given out\' just before completing my shave and one leg had not gotten a smooth shave.  Trying Venus Embrace the next day, not only did I get an immediate and smooth shave on the \'unfinished\' leg, but on reshaving the \'completely shaved\' leg, I found that that I actually had not gotten a really thorough shave on it the day before either.I have always resisted those shaped, fat-handled razors because they look bulky.  My regular razor was thin and straight-handeled.  Now I see what all the hype is about.  The handle is comfortable, fits perfectly into the hand, is soft to the touch, and is wonderfully positioned.  It just feels \'good\' in my hand.  Actually it feels \'great\'.No \'suctioned-cupped\' item has ever seemed to work for me.  If they stuck at all, they were generally on the floor the next day.  Therefore I originally didn\'t intend to even try the showerpod.  After reconsidering how helpful it would be to have all my shaving utensils available inside the tub/shower area, I positioned it where I thought it would be handy if it would stick and affixed the suction cups.  Voila, it not only stuck, it is still there weeks later, never having come \'unstuck\' even once.While I regret my stubborness to give the newer-styled ladies razors a chance; I am completely sold on this Venus Embrance razor and anticipate it will be a long time before I think about changing razor brands again.

For me, the soft rubber \'rumble strip\' that Gillette adds to these newer models just gets in the way and prevents me from getting as close a shave as I get with the good old Sensor. Another problem with the Gillette Fusion is the location of the pivot point between the handle and the cartridge; it\'s just plain awkward. That, coupled with the ribbed rubber strip, creates major shaving frustration. In any case, Gillette makes the best blades, at least for thick barbed wire beards like mine. Schick blades are garbage by comparison. They seem dull even when they\'re brand new, which leaves me a nicked-up, bloody mess.

The gaudy styling...this is no Apple product! The battery...uh, what? Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...But, I needed a razor and the introductory price for the razor and blade is cheap and so I one-clicked it.Only had a day\'s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby and I didn\'t have to go over areas twice. Even glided smoothy and efficiently over the adams apple area. Battery on one side, unpowered on the other. Didn\'t notice a difference.Not a hard test, not enough for a review either, so I didn\'t shave for 4 or 5 days and tried it again. Non-powered on the right side, it was a dramatic improvement over previous multi-bladed shavers. Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better. Just a hair easier. It does help with a thick growth, not a noticeable difference to me with an overnight\'s worth. Of course, this will be different for everyone.Is the motor worth it? Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here. Would two or three blades work just as well? Not likely the cost would be much less, so what the heck, the more blades the better. Play with those blades. They really are very different than anything I have seen before.I really don\'t think I can get a better shave. A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly. I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don\'t take much time doing it. The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it. It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.The little trimmer blade works well.This is a highly recommended product, one that actually may make some difference in your life if shaving has been difficult for you. It is new and better technology.    "

Right before they arrived, I NEEDED new blades, so I bought a pack at the store.  That pack was horrible...I felt like I didn\'t shave my legs at all.  I couldn\'t even really feel it against my skin as I was shaving like you normally do.  I literally had to go over each swipe like 3 times...and still wasn\'t a good smooth feel.When I got the blades from Amazon, the first pack I opened were the same thing.  I was ready to scream considering what you pay for the razors and the blades...a disposable would get you the same result.  I tried a blade from the second pack then, and that one worked MUCH better.I really think Mach is going downhill in their products, and it has become a \'you might get lucky and it works well\' with the razor blades.  Some are fine...some are horrible.if it is worth it to you to take a chance, then...you might get lucky.  As for me...I think I am looking for a new razor.    "

I\'d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it\'s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you\'re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.I have one implant, and some \'erosions\' on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it\'s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.Don\'t throw away that manual toothbrush, though.  There is still one mouth maintenance chore that the Oral-b does not handle well -- brushing of your tongue.  The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \'tooth\' brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  If you check my other reviews, you\'ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed."

Although both blades have the same shape and 3 blades, regular Venus blades cut me up without fail. Sometimes I wouldn\'t even notice and I\'d find blood on my white towels or sheets. I noticed a major increase in irritation and even had some bumps become infected. Even my lower legs, which have always been the easiest place for me to get a perfect shave felt rough after using these blades. I\'d always find patches I missed later, too.I always use a very high quality shaving cream to reduce irritation but even it can\'t compete with the amateur performance of Venus blades and I can tell you exactly why. Regular Venus blades do not have the comfort coating, smoothing cushions or multiple moisture strips of the Divine. In my book, those features are definitely worth paying more.    "

One of the reasons is that it\'s strong enough to really clean your hair but not so harsh that it dries your scalp.  In the past I\'ve had highlights and I\'ve used this shampoo without any detrimental effects.  Granted, if I colored my hair again I would use a shampoo made especially for treated hair (probably Pantene, since I\'m a creature of habit).As far as conditioning I have to say that it is very light.  For my daughter, for example, who has fine, straight, but remarkably easy-to-tangle hair, we still have to use a detangler.  So it\'s a lighter conditioning effect than if you used a separate conditioner.  Personally I like this because it doesn\'t \'weigh\' down my hair, just controls the humidity frizzes.OVERALL, a gentle, thorough cleanser with gentle conditioning that makes combing after shampooing easier.Pam T~mom-blogger "

I\'ve experimented with this razor for the past few days.  I will not be permanently upgrading to this.  For some reason, Gillette appears to have completely bought into the notion that five blades gives a better shave than just two or three.  Like the Fusion Power, the Fusion Proglide Power has some of the same problems.  The most obvious problem it has is cost (just like the Fusion Power).  For the quality of the shave you get, the cost of replacement cartridges is not justified.  To be fair, I have noticed a slightly more comfortable glide with this over the Fusion Power.  The blade stabilizer and microcombs do appear to be a modest improvement in this regard.  Also, the Fusion Proglide blades appear to last a little longer than the Fusion Power blades - but not by much.  The micropulses still do not provide a greater degree of comfort over a razor that lacks this feature.  Also, I have not noticed a closer shave with this razor over the current one I am using (which is now the Schick Hydro 3).  When comparing it my current razor, the Fusion Proglide Power definitely lacks the level of smoothness and comfort.  Last but not least, just like its predecessor, I\'ve discovered this five bladed razor tends to nick my face more often than a double or triple bladed razor.  Gillette needs to get back to basics by realizing it is much easier to keep a satisfied customer who gets a good, comfortable shave as opposed to introducing new brands of razors that have gimmicks, and that are, not to mention, ridiculously overpriced.

Almost all the reviews for the 1000 said the pressure sensor didn\'t work or was innefective. So I ended up getting the Vitality ($24.99) instaed of getting the 5000 ($119-149) that I would not have been as happy with. I spent hours looking for a review that told me this exact info so, you\'re welcome.

I did read some reviews that said the heads wrer a little large, I have a small mouth and while the heads are thicker than a manual brush it was by no means unmanageable or uncomfortable.

I have sensitive skin that is dry but also tends to itch a lot once new hair growth starts.  I usually have to use a sensitive skin gel with a razor, even the ones that have strips on them.  I decided to use this in the shower on my legs with the gel I had...worried I shouldn\'t use it alone.  Halfway through I ran out of gel so I had an accidental test with this razor alone on one leg and the combo of gel/razor on the other.  The next day when itchiness tends to rear its ugly head, I didn\'t feel any dryness or irritation from either side.  So the Venus works on my hyper sensitive skin.  I was surprised, after two weeks of hanging in the shower on its included hook, be it as high up and away from water drops and steam I could get it, it didn\'t show any telltale signs of rusting, which I have gotten with other Venus line razors.  It has made me take out razors from the shower and dry them then put them in a bedroom door to give them the longest life. Not this one.  I could use this for a long time, well, until the soap wears off, without the blades getting dull or rusting.  I did, however cut the edge of  my ankle with the razor, it is sharp, caution should be taken with it.  It\'s pretty powerful for what it is though I do have fine blonde leg hair.  That might be why it cuts through it all like butter.    "

4770,1597,1638,20080904,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 4, 2008",A1ZM846Y7AUYD,A Breakthrough in Power Toothbrush Design,"I have used many different power toothbrushes over the past several years.  All have been from the Sonicare and Oral-B line of products.  I have been amazed at how the technology and design of these products have changed over the years.  They continue to get smaller, more powerful, and now tend to include multiple operation modes and interchangeable brushes and accessories.  Although there is clearly nothing wrong with scrubbing your teeth the traditional way, with a good old-fashioned toothbrush, I find that the power toothbrushes tend to remove stains better and keep my teeth whiter.Gone are the days when a power toothbrush was a rather bulky, noisy product.  Oral-B has introduced a new, extremely slim, power toothbrush that is not much bigger than a traditional (manual) toothbrush.  The new Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is truly a breakthrough in power toothbrush design.  Weighing a mere 1.8 oz., with the brush head attached, the dimensions of the handle and brush assembly is roughly 8 1/4\' long and only 11/16\' (just under 3/4\') around at the thickest part of the handle.  The brush head is about 2/3 of the width and 3/4 of the length of a traditional toothbrush.  The charging base measures approximately 1 3/4\' - H x 1 5/8\' - W x 3\' - D.  While I like the small footprint of the charging base, I find it a bit too light, which causes it to slide around on the countertop too easily.Some of the manufacturer boasted features of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush are as follows:* Provides Gentle Sonic Vibration - More than 27,000 Vibrations per Minute* Multiple User Modes:  Clean (normal) and Sensitive* Super-Thin Bristles for Precision Cleaning, Polishing  and Whitening*  Professional Timer, Providing Tactile Feedback at 30-second Intervals for Changing Quadrants of Your Mouth, and Once the Dental Expert Recommended 2-minute Brushing Time Has Been Reached* Provides Up To 30 Minutes Of Use Between Charges* Reduces Up to 94% of Surface Stains in 2 Weeks* Lightweight Slim Handle Provides Effective Maneuverability and Control* Warranty:  2-Year LimitedThe current Pulsonic S15 kit includes the following items:-  Oral-B Pulsonic Power Handle- One Standard Pulsonic Brush Head- One Precision Tip Brush Head- Charging Base w/ Brush Head Storage- Instruction Manual- Misc. Warranty and Registration PaperworkSetting up and using the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush couldn\'t be any easier.  The small charging base simply plugs into an available A/C outlet and sits on your countertop.  Although the instruction manual doesn\'t specifically mention anything about mounting the charging base, there are two slotted holes on the backside, which would allow for wall mounting.  Once the charging base is plugged in you simply sit the Pulsonic Power Brush handle into a recessed opening on the front of the base.  As with most rechargeable products these days, you must initially wait several hours for the device to charge before you begin using it.  The Pulsonic toothbrush requires 12 hours on the charging base before it is fully charged.  The instructions do not say anything about using the toothbrush before it is fully charged, so I guess one could try it out within an hour or two if they wished.  There are two other recessed openings on the base, to allow for storage of the included Precision Tip brush head and a spare standard brush head.  The front of the toothbrush handle has a single power/mode button and three indicator lights.  Two of the LED indicators show what cleaning mode the brush is in, when powered on (clean or sensitive), while the third LED lights up when the device is charging.  A single push of the power/mode button activates the power toothbrush in \'Clean\' mode, while a second push of the button switches the toothbrush into \'Sensitive\' mode.  Pushing the button a third time powers the toothbrush off.  Therefore, if you push the button once, and use the standard clean mode, you will need to push the button twice more in order to power the device off.Unlike the typical oscillating head type power toothbrushes that Oral-B is known for, which require the user to simply hold the head on each tooth for cleaning, this Pulsonic model requires you to move the head around in a circular motion while cleaning.  This can take a little getting used to if you are more accustomed to the oscillating brush-type models, like I am.  There is no need to scrub your teeth with the Pulsonic toothbrush.  You simply move the brush head gently over your teeth (in the aforementioned circular motion), letting the sonic vibrations perform the work of cleaning and polishing your teeth.  Although these vibrations are fairly gentle, switching to the sensitive mode reduces the strength of the vibration by about 1/3.  The vibration speed remains the same, but the intensity becomes gentler and feels less abrasive against your teeth.  While brushing, the Pulsonic toothbrush provides a short stutter (a single break in vibration), at 30-second intervals, to let you know that you are supposed to switch quadrants in your mouth.  Once you have brushed for the professionally recommended 2-minutes, a longer stutter (two breaks in vibration) can be heard and felt.  This form of tactile feedback is quite effective in keeping the user informed as to the status of their brushing session.Once you have finished brushing with the Pulsonic toothbrush, cleanup is a snap.  You simply run the brush head under water and rinse thoroughly.  To better clean the top portion of the toothbrush handle, you can easily remove the brush head attachment by turning the head counter-clockwise (about 1/4 turn) and lifting it off the handle.  The top portion of the handle can be rinsed under running water, but it is not recommended to run water over the lower, controller portion of the handle.  Reinstalling the brush head onto the handle is as simple as lowering it into place and giving about a 1/4 clockwise turn.  You will hear and feel it click into place.  Cleaning the charging base is just as easy.  Since you should never get the electrical portion of the charger base wet, Oral-B has designed the base with a removable top, which can then be cleaned under running water.  To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  After cleaning the removable portion, you can wipe the bottom portion of the base with a dry cloth.  To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  She has been using it regularly and has given me the following pros and cons for this Pulsonic model:Pros******- Extremely slim and lightweight.- Comfortable to hold and is well balanced- Very quiet operation- Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth & gums- Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth & gums- Easy to use and clean- Perfect size for travel- Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work- Charging base takes up very little space on the countertopCons*******- Charging base slides around countertop too easily- No low battery warning indicator- No indication of when charging is complete- Spare brush storage is not covered- No travel/storage case includedMy wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  She has stayed away from power toothbrushes in the past because she didn\'t like the fat handles, noisy operation, and uncomfortable brush heads.  Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  She doesn\'t like leaving the brush heads exposed, so she keeps the spares in a drawer, due to the lack of covered brush storage on the base.  She also wishes that the charging base was weighted, so that it wouldn\'t slide around on the counter so easily.  She informed me that she wants the base mounted to the wall so she doesn\'t have to continue dealing with it sliding around.Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife\'s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B\'s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  I was very tempted to give this Pulsonic toothbrush a 5-star rating, but I honestly feel that Oral-B has overlooked a few important details that will hopefully be corrected on future model releases.  First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don\'t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  The charging base either needs to be weighted or should have better griping foot pads to prevent it from sliding all over the place.  And why they don\'t have a low battery indicator on this toothbrush is anyone\'s guess.  Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  Since the Pulsonic is the perfect size for travel, including a travel case would make perfect sense.  Hopefully they will at least offer a Pulsonic travel case, as an optional accessory, in the near future.  My wife and I consider the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush a 4 and 1/2 star product, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powered brush but doesn\'t want the typical fat-handled, noisy products that have always been the norm."

My hair is wavy to curly, very thick, and can feel quite coarse with the wrong weather or product.  I often suffer from frizziness or a lack of definition in my curls.This Pantene conditioner was average at best -- it smells nice, goes on easily, but leaves my hair feeling very coated -- in a slippery way, however, which is often nice with difficult to manage curly hair.  The matching shampoo was a terrible disappointment however (leaving my hair feeling unclean and coated in a non-slippery way) -- so I tried this conditioner with several other shampoos (both Pantene and non-Pantene sorts).  The best results came after  something like Pantene\'s old Ice Shine shampoo -- though still, only average smoothing and mild taming of my locks, which definitely felt over-coated even after a thorough rinsing.I second what an earlier reviewer said about silicone -- it\'s a shortcut for curly hair that seems to pay you back later in buildup and less-than-satisfactory results in the long run, and it\'s disappointing to find it in this product.I wouldn\'t go out of my way to recommend this conditioner, though I\'ll keep it on hand to use when I\'m out of everything else!

The blades felt like they were scraping too closely against my skin and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience, without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.A year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!) instead of buying a new razor altogether. The experience was completely different from what I remembered!

Another bonus is that Oral-B redesigned the charging base, making it much easier to clean than previous generations.My only real complaint is that the brush will indicate when 30 seconds has passed by stopping, then restarting suddenly. That feature (meant to alert you when it\'s time to brush a different quadrant of your mouth) is somewhat irritating as it feels like the batteries have run out momentarily. I would prefer a chime or LED indicator.  Other than that, it\'s a decent choice of electric toothbrush."

I just started using it and it definitely has some extra power that my old one didn\'t have.  It is a bit loud, so if you have sensitive ears, be warned of that.  It charged fast and is holding its battery power well (I don\'t charge it every time I use it).  I brush for 3 minutes and use the 30 second timers for back, top/bottom, right/left, then the extra minute for my front top and bottom... I thought I would hate the 30 second timer and find it annoying, but turns out its really handy to brush each of the areas long enough.  I haven\'t used the little clock thing as I tend to walk around as I brush, but I imagine it would be good for those adjusting to electric toothbrushes and/or kids.  I also probably won\'t use the extra brush holder as my medicine cabinet doesn\'t have the room.  The travel case will definitely come in handy and the small charger is a nice change from my old clunky one.Pros:*Great clean*30 second pauses and 2 minute longer pause*Small charger*Travel case*Should help your dentist visits!!*Pressure notification (if you are brushing too hard, it gives some warning, but I haven\'t experienced it)*Separate timer would be good for kids or those new to electronic brushesCons:*Louder than my old model*Extra stuff... not sure many people need the brush holder, only some will use the separate timer*New heads are expensive"

There are 5 blades, all parallel to each other, which is the secret to the close shave. Each blade is sharper than the one above it. The first blade, which is the least sharp, functions to pull the hair out of the follicle a bit, then the second blade cuts the hair and pulls on it some more, then the third blade cuts some more and pulls the hair out even further. Finally, before the hair can snap back, the fourth blade moves in, and cuts the wily hair to infinity. My theory is that the fifth blade is just a marketing ploy and it really doesn\'t do anything. So, if you are willing to spend the money for the closest shave ever, buy this product. Or, if you are out of work because of the economy, you should get a Bic razor from Wal Mart.    "

NOT sold by \'So & So\' and \'Fulfilled\' by Amazon - not good. Unfortunately these 3rd party sellers are selling fake blades - the ones everybody\'s complaining about - the same ones you\'ll find all over e-bay.I\'m ashamed to say I\'ve been using the fake (knock-off, counterfeit) blades for a couple of years. I had a hunch that either something was wrong or Gillette wasn\'t consistent with their product. Because some blades were better than others, some just didn\'t feel right from the start, and none of them lasted all that long. So this time around when I went looking to purchase new shaving materials I heard all this talk about phony blades and it all made sense. Those bums definitely made a fool out of me with their slick packaging, because they certainly \'look\' like real authentic Gillette replacement blades but they aren\'t.And now that I\'ve once again shaved my head with a REAL Gillette Mach 3 Turbo blade purchased from a reputable retailer (Amazon) I now realize what I have been missing - a smooth, close, effortless shave which doesn\'t tear me up. And to my surprise the lubricating feature on the Turbo actually works! A great product.One more word of advice - keep your eye on the price of this item as it fluctuates often!

I do think that they proglide may be sharper and give a better shave for the first 1-3 shaves but then they seem the same.  I also think the proglide did not last quite as long but can\'t be sure.  I usually got 2 weeks from the regular but only got about 10 days with the proglide.  Reason I can\'t be sure is I skipped shaving and it had to deal with a 2 day growth twice and that may have \'shortened\' the use.  I just wish I could find a razor that was more economical.  I had gone electric but suffered from irritation and when you figure the purchase plus the 2x a year blade replacement (yes electrics need blade replacement too) the cost came out the same.  When the 5 blade razor first appeared a news story did a comparision with the 3 blade.  There was no noticeable difference in the quality of shave that the review panel could feel.  I may go back to the Mach 3 or try a Schick product.  I have always used Gillette razors.  I would give a 4 for quality but knock it down to a 3 because of cost.

It doesn\'t last as long between charges (approximately 1/2 as long, 5 days instead of 10 days), and you\'ll need to be careful about letting it discharge once in a while because of the memory effect of NiCd batteries.It also lacks a lot of the frills of the other toothbrush. No LED light to indicating charging / charge full, and it does not pulse at 30 second intervals when brushing. It does pulse at the end of 2 minutes though.The brushing action is also different from the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush. The brushing action feels weaker, though I must admit the teeth feels just as clean afterwards. I tried the same toothbrush head on them - they appear to be interchangeable. I\'ve also tried the original toothbrush head. I can\'t judge effectiveness (they appear to all clean well) but the one that came with the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush feels more comfortable to me - better contact with the teeth.This toothbrush is significantly lighter, but otherwise the construction looks to be about the same level as the other one.I\'m giving it 4 stars despite the shortcomings because it is significantly cheaper than the other toothbrush. I think they balance each other out (I\'d rate my existing toothbrush 4 stars as well).For me at least, an electric toothbrush cleans teeth much better than manual brushing and although I\'m definitely not a dentist, I recommend them."

I shave a lot of stuff- legs, arms, armpits, bikini area, and my big toe. I can get away with shaving some areas once a week, but my legs need to be shaved at least every other day during the summer or there is visable black stubble. I have very sensitive skin that often gets razor burn and ingrown hairs. So I got this thinking, perfect! Three blades= close shave; built in shave gel= more convenient and faster.Well, there are several issues with this razor. During the first use, I noticed two things: One, there is a lot of slobbery goop coming off the razor... and two, the shave gel bars that sit above and below the blades make it very difficult to get a close shave. They do flex a little, but especially when they are new, they are cumbersome and they block the blades from getting close enough to the skin, especially in contoured areas like the knee and the bikini area. It does moisturize well, though, and at least for the first use or two, you won\'t need to use any shaving cream. I didn\'t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn\'t able to shave.By the third use, those gel bars have worn down a little (or a lot) and you can get a closer shave. But now with less slobbery gel goop, you are very likely to have irritated skin or little cuts. I have to use soap to lubricate my skin before shaving if the cartridge is not brand new, and I keep cutting my armpit with this razor and I didn\'t seem to have that problem with the regular Venus razor.The gel is either gone or falls off by about the fifth or sixth use. These cartridges are just way too expensive to have to replace them so often. I found that leaving the razor in the shower cuts it\'s life even shorter so I keep it in a cupboard when I\'m not using it... so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn\'t serve much purpose. Maybe if you are the only one who uses your shower and you shave every time you\'re in there you can get some use out of it.I like using this on my legs during the summer when I shave every day and I don\'t want to spend the extra time with shaving cream. I don\'t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble. I wouldn\'t buy this again- the regular Venus is easier to maneuver and shaves closer. Even if I have to buy shaving cream again.    "

I had one in a drawer that cost under $20 that I never used because it was heavy and loud so I always thought I would stick to a manual toothbrush, much to the consternation of my dentist.  After reading a few reviews and talking to my hygenist I decided on the Oral-B 5000 and love it!  At first it seemed like way too much technology for something so basic, but after the short read through the manual and letting it charge I was ready to go and it only took a few uses to get the hang of.  The manual was very easy to read and understand and didn\'t really take that long to review.  Another reason that I decided on the Oral-B was because of the smaller head of the brush.  A friend of mine with another brand toothbrush said that she wishes that she had thought of that when she purchased hers.  It really is a great toothbrush and I do really feel that it deep cleans.  My only complaint about the toothbrush is that it is sort of loud, but on the sensitive setting it isn\'t too bad.  But if you need help waking up in the morning...maybe the noise will help!  Overall I really do love it and see it as a good investment into my oral hygiene."

By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations. Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.Looks and size: nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).I would recommend this product to my family and friends."

I lathered up and was amazed as the razor glided effortlessly over my face and through the stubble, giving the smoothest, most comfortable shave that I have had. Not a bit of drag or irritation was experienced, so I let my beard grow for a week, thinking that this time it would fail the standard it now set. To my amazement, the shave was still superb with no irritation. I finally tested it by shaving daily with the same results.Concerning the lubricating strip, it is a definite improvement, being more slick and lasting longer while the handle allows a more secure and comfortable grip than its predecessor. I\'m still on my first blade after 4 weeks and the shave is still very comfortable. The single blade at the back of the blade head does a great job especially above the top and lower lip, and the soft blue glow of the power button does add a cool touch. Shaving was done with the power feature on and off, but either way the shave is excellent.Overall, Gillette definitely has a winner here with the Proglide Power Razor. I\'d definitely recommend it, so give it a try and I\'m sure you won\'t be disappointed!    "

She found the handle to be easy to grip, the gel area around the head to be comfortable and the wall holding unit to be well designed and useful. She also stated that the shave from this razor was closer than most she has tried.The only drawback to the razor is the replacement blades, which, when compared against disposable razors, can run into some money. Since I am the sucker that spends the money on new blades, she and I will have to have a talk about just how much extra this unit is worth.

She is satisfied with the oral-b design.Over the sonicare, this has a smaller brush-head which can get into smaller places easier.Unlike the original oral b brushes, this is rechargable which is a major plus when you get halfway through brushing and the batteries suddenly die.Personally, my preference is for the sonicare system as it really cleans well, but even my father has tried this and thinks it might be doing a better job than the sonicare.Time will tell and I\'ll update my review with new info as the checkups come in.  Since we had used the AA battery verion before, we had extra brush-heads to all try the unit which is good in a family environment.  I think we felt the purchase price of the sonicare alot more since I don\'t live at home and had to buy my own.  I think the pricepoint oral b managed to hit at 1/4 the price of the sonicare system is a very affordable way for people to add a powered brush to their oral hygene."

I\'ve used razors with five blades that hurt like hell and weren\'t easy to use.That said, the Venus Embrace has all the extra features of advanced razors AND performs excellently in all the above three categories.

That means shaving everyday or every other day because you go to work.  Because there is so much more surface area in the blade design it really is a breeze to shave.I have quite senitive skin, and I can now finally shave everyday with out getting cut up.HOWEVER... If you leave your face unshaved for more than 3 days... like a full weekend.  It doesnt shave as well.  The long hairs get caught up in the blades and almost rip out.  The Mach 3 does a much better job at long hairs.  It is possible to shave with the fusion, but it takes a longer time since you have to keep rining it out every inch of a shave.I had this razor since the first day it came out.  The best thing  I have noticed is that each blade lasts about 2 weeks. My Mach 3 usually lasted a week.  ( Like i said i have senstive skin and once the blade starts going, my face gets all cut up. )  So blades are more expensive but they do last longer.Overall.  Best razor every if you need to shave frequently.  If you are a contruction worker or someone that only shaves once or twice a week... I wouldnt recommend it.    "

Then this is your razor.If you want to shave with a piece of flint, save a few bucks and thumb your nose at the system? Not my problem. Will lesser razors shave your face? Yep, especially if you like nicks, cuts, razor burn, multiple passes, shaving against the grain, re-shaving, $20 shaving creams, $80 shave brushes, pre-shave oils, soothing aftershaves, witch hazel, styptic sticks, hanging out on internet forums wondering what you\'re doing wrong, etc... And if you can find the economy in that, let me know.Did I mention this razors performance in more private areas? Nothing even comes close. And electric personal groomers are poor in performance by comparison.As for the cost, for me this is a non-issue. I can get months out of one cartridge relatively easily and with a little common sense that seems abundant out here in the woods, less so in the city. Therefore, this and other razors of its type (Mach 3 innovation) are no more expensive to me than a \'classic\' double edged razor which I have as well. It stays in the drawer mostly.

Recently I asked my girlfriend to pick up some razors at the store \'not cheap ones please\' and boy was that a mistake. Anyway, I happened to be on Amazon already buying something so I looked at razors and decided on this one. I actually didn\'t know that it was a battery operated razor. I had used a Gillette razor before and it gave me a good shave. So when I got this one with the battery and stuff I was kinda skeptical but figured it would shave good without the vibrations so I didn\'t have to turn it on to shave if I didn\'t want to... I thought maybe it would just carve up my face like a Halloween pumpkin. The first time I used it I was very pleasantly surprised. I figured maybe it was just because it was a brand new blade, which always shave great the first time. I am here writing this review now because after a week and a half of using this thing with the same blade, it\'s still shaving closer than any shave I\'ve ever had before. Really. I have had close shaves before but could still feel where the hair would eventually come back again meaning it was close but like it was only cutting the hair even with the skin and this one seems to cut it even lower if that makes sense. I can\'t believe how smooth my face is. Truly smooth as a baby\'s butt. I have to actually take my time and pay attention now more than before, because if I miss a spot, I can really feel the difference. My girlfriend has really noticed the difference too... (don\'t tell her I said this but it\'s almost annoying how much she is touching and kissing my face now. lol)I didn\'t get any replacement blades with my original order, but I\'ve been looking at the local stores and all the prices have been twice what I see here on Amazon for replacement blades. The actual razor is about the same, but I laughed when I saw 4 replacement blades at Rite Aid for the same price I just bought 8 here on Amazon. I think I\'ll buy some more replacements to have on hand when I go traveling next month.I have no idea what the last reviewer is complaining about. This thing is great... and the extra blade for trimming sideburns is great, even helps me to get under my nose perfectly. I feel no danger of being cut.

Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you\'ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn\'t work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife\'s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you\'re used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I\'m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn\'t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I\'ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I\'m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit."

They are totally inferior to the real thing available at 3 for $21.00 in American drug stores.  The brushing heads quickly become loose and the body slips on the metal shaft of the toothbrush base. Pinching lips is another wonderful feature.  Some prices are too good to be true.  This fake item is nowhere near the quality of real replacement heads available to you locally.  Avoid this rip-off.

These blades are not as sharp from the start and only last 2 or 3 shaves compared to 10 or more for the ones I buy from Walmart, Target, or Sam\'s. The lube strip also wears out with the first shave. I have been told that these blades are made in Europe where the steel quality is poor and the manufacturing process is not as exacting. Do not buy these blades on Amazon, period. It looks like a good deal but you are better off paying more at a retail store for the real thing.    "

Because of this I\'ve used the old fashioned manual brushes that did a reasonable job of keeping my teeth clean. Well, this tradition is about to change.After using this brush, my teeth have a smooth and polished feel all the way down to just below the gum line! Amazing! Even my manual brushes don\'t do as thorough a job. Also, the brush charges through induction which means that it\'s waterproof and has no wires or metal contact points that need to be protected from water. This is very cool.I could only find one minor downside to this brush which is that the head is somewhat thick. What I mean is that the distance between the bristle tips and back of the head makes it necessary for me to open my mouth fairly wide  to get the brush the tops of my rear molars. This isn\'t a challenge for me but it might be for someone with a smaller mouth.I guess I can summarize my review by saying that I\'m tossing out my manual brushes because this is now my personal favorite. Heck, I might even brush more often because I like the feel of clean, polished teeth!"

So I spent about 40 minutes at the grocery store agonizing over my choice, and finally picked the Vitality due to its reasonable cost and the included replacement head. So far I really like it for getting my teeth clean without my feeling like I have to scrub. I notice I don\'t put near as much pressure on my teeth and gums as I used to. I still may switch to the sensitive heads, though, as my gums feel a little worn after brushing. I like the timer too.The only things I wish could be improved are the packaging (I almost cut my hand off removing the brush!) and the lack of a charger light. Otherwise I think this is a good buy and am looking forward to good report at my next dentist appointment.**UPDATE:**I did switch to the sensitive head and I like that better. My teeth still feel clean, and the brush is much gentler. I would advise the sensitive brush if you tend to use too much pressure when brushing.Also wanted to note that the instruction sheet is very thorough and gives good information on how to use the brush and how to tell if you\'re brushing too hard."

They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion Power blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.    "

To be on the safe side, I charged it for the full 16-hr recommended charge time before initial use.  It comes with two identical interchangeable brush heads.  I plan to have my two young children use the brush, however, the brushes are identical, with no markings to distinguish them, so I marked one brush at the base with a permanent marker to indicate the difference.  The brushing action is robust and does a good job of scrubbing tooth surfaces.  There is no need for additional pressure or manual brush strokes.  The brush has a built-in timer and makes a stuttering sound after you have brushed for two minutes.  My kids enjoy the brush and don\'t find it overly harsh or difficult to use.  I was quite pleased with the results and feel it does a better job than relying on them to properly use the manual brush.  The two-minute timer also makes sure they brush for a sufficient duration.  We\'re approaching two weeks of use without a recharge.  That\'s pretty good battery life, considering it\'s used twice a day by two people.  So it\'s a pretty good brush, especially if you have kids or don\'t want to spend a fortune on one of the fancier more expensive power toothbrushes."

It\'s great.  I still get the nice lift from the shampoo, plus my hair is manageable and feels healthy.Today, I colored my hair (which is really drying) but I know from experience that the conditioner that comes with my hair color leaves my hair even more flat and limp than usual.  It won\'t even hold a style.  I decided to try this conditioner instead, and am I ever pleased. I have none of the extra dryness that usually results from coloring, but still have nice lift, body and sheen.  It seems like I get all the advantages of a conditioner without the disadvantages.

EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as \'Clean Shower\' or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.)Then I set the razor so it\'s standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I\'d also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I\'ve been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I\'ve nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I\'m very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.)Note to Gillette... Send me a lifetime supply of Fusion cartridges and I\'ll consider removing the blade-life extending tip from this review!  ;-)- Jonathan Sabin    "

Whenever it starts to get dull, I can keep the razor itself and just change out the blades. Even the blades seem to last a long time, at least for me. I only have to change them once every six months. I like this because it has a moisture strip, but it\'s small. The razors with big moisture strips are absolutely ridiculous; I\'m assuming you\'re supposed to use those for when you have no soap to use because those basically provide the soap for you, which I find annoying. I haven\'t tried any 5-blade razors or anything like that so I don\'t have much to compare this to, but it\'s a good razor I\'ve had for years that has never let me down, and I love the color.    "

The problem with Sonicare was durability (that was less than 2 years on average) and high cost. But I should say that when (once) it died during first year, it took one phone call to get replacement.Oral-B looked better per reviews and also it had cheaper replacement heads. So, we decided to give a try.As a toothbrush, it works differently from Sonicare and at the beginning we liked it quite more. But after a while, I\'m not sure which one I like more. In either case, it does job done. I would not suggest buying the fancy timer though.However, this one died in a half a year. By itself, one sample is not a statistic. But customer support was quite less friendly and we had to ship the toothbrush with papers for \'repair\'. At the end, we\'ve got a new one - but is was much more painful.Bottom line: I would rate the toothbrush about the same as Sonicare, quite worth customer support and (so far) same poor reliability. If this one will die within next year or two, I probably will switch back to Phillips."

It was nothing to write home about and was very basic compared to what is available these days. Once the battery went dead, I just went back to a manual toothbrush. I decided after my dentist appointment that my wife and I went to a couple weeks ago and having to pay $70(times 2) out of pocket as my copay for a deep cleaning for each of us to remove build up under the gums that I would see what was available in a rechargeable. It was a toss up as my dentist recommended both Oral-B, but only carried SonicCare with a $15 rebate at the front counter for sale. While at the Dentist office, I did enter a drawing for their top of the line SonicCare FlexCare Plus with Sanitizer by donating some can food for a local food bank for Thanksgiving. I am the type of guy that if I brought 999 cans and had a 999 out a thousand chance would not win in a drawing. I went home....researched both brands....read tons of reviews and checked the pricing on Amazon. The Oral-B reviews were consistly higher and the price with the 50% rebate on this model made it a hands down easier decision. This professional care toothbrush normally $159.99 retail was on Amazon last Wednesday for $104.99. I purchased 2 sets. They arrived at my door yesterday, with the free shipping and no sales tax. I was impressed when I opened them as to all that was included. My mindset was ....wow....only $50 for all this per set after rebate. It comes with at nice durable blue travel case that houses the toothbrush, and 2 brush heads. A nice travel charger that is multi-voltage and will work in other countries such as UK or Australia. It even came with an extra set of duracell batteries for the remote control clock/timer. I thought that was a nice touch that they would include those. The rechargable toothbrushes were both battery dead, so I set one up in each bathroom, and let them charge overnight to full charge. I used mine first thing this morning and was pleasantly surprised as to how easy and proficient it was brushing...I mean.... 30000 brush stokes per minute is 500 per second and I know I was never doing that manually. It comes with two different styled toothbrushes...one round and one flossing type. The flossing type is my favorite as it actually is flossing while brushing, so it is a 2 in 1 brush. Your teeth will feel like you just had them professionally cleaned at the dentist office. That nice squeaky sound when you touch your teeth with your finger. The toothbrush has like 5 settings for brushing from Sensitive to Deep Clean. The default setting worked perfectly for my teeth and gums. The little handy remote control timer......sits to the side and not only gives you the time of day, but when you turn on the toothbrush it automatically starts a 2 minute timer or 3 minute depending on how you set it up and times you on a 2 minute timer to 30 seconds per quadrant and lets you know when to move to the next set of teeth in the next quadrant and gives you a smiley face when you are done.  Funny, as I was typing this review I got a phone call from my dentist telling me that I won the raffle for the $189.99 Sonic FlexCare+ with sanitizer and that I could come pick it up. While I have never won anything before I am more hyped up on the Oral B and will likely just sell the SonicCare FlexCare+ on Craigslist for more than I paid for both of my Oral B\'s together. I apologize if this was too wordy. I am not a professional writer and I base what I buy off of what others write and just did not want to miss anything."

The kit includes two ProWhite brush heads designed to remove surface stains and polish teeth bright white.

The longest and least stiff blue fibers gradually loose color with use indicating the remaining life of the brush (listed as 3 months).  There is a deep cleaning orange rubber center in the brush for deep cleaning of stains.  I have noticed a clean difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums after a week of using the ProWhite.The handle of the device fits the hand nicely because of its large diameter and a ribbed blue rubber grip covering the back of the smooth light blue plastic cylinder. The cylinder has a battery that is recharged by placing it upright on a plastic stand. The unit fits on the stand with a plastic receiver on a plastic plug, so electric shock to the user is avoided. The entire hand device can be rinsed completely (not the recharging stand).There is a built in timer on the Vitality that alerts the brusher when the recommended brush time of two minutes have elapsed with a noticeable pulsing action of the brushes and the accompanying change in sound from continuous to intermittent. After the timing alert, the device resumes continuous brushing.I highly recommend this rechargeable toothbrush.  I have switched from a regular brush to the exclusive use of the Vitality. I will order the four other brush heads each with a unique cleaning function. A $3.00 coupon for these heads is included in the kit. The rotary action of the brush is superior to the electric toothbrush I tried years ago that used an up and down motion that I did not like."

But lately, I\'ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \'bristles\' and how they\'d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I\'d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I\'ll be certain to purchase this model again.

Any retail store you go to this is going to be around $140-$160.I will start with the pros. The first time I started using the Oral B 5000 toothbrush I noticed how clean my teeth felt after brushing. I have been using this product for over a month now and love the pressure sensor. That is the main reason why I bought this product is because I have a habit of brushing hard. It has 4 dedicated modes which are great and one mode with extended time. I switch modes pretty much every time I use it. My teeth are getting slightly whiter after a month. The wireless brushing guide/clock is really handy so you can see what mode you are on and how much time you have been brushing. The charging base is great and very portable compared to other models.Now the cons. There are only a few things that I can think of that aren\'t that great with this toothbrush. The display mode on the handle really bugs me. It just displays the battery and nothing else. This is pretty pointless especially when you travel. Because it doesn\'t tell you which mode you are in so you have to go by feel to figure which mode you want. The display of the battery is so large it makes me wonder how much battery it drains to display that thing because its always on. That brings me to my next point is the life of the battery. It says in the manual that the life is 10 days. But seems to be less than that. My girlfriend has the 4000 and hers lasts longer than mine. Her display is for the battery is smaller and in the corner of the display instead of enourmous and in the middle.

I don\'t know if newer Sonicare toothbrushes have a different design. I used the Sonicare Elite for many years until the nickel-cadmium battery died. I didn\'t notice the inferior design of the Sonicare until I started using the Oral-B 5000. The Sonicare has fat plastic at the brush end which is not as comfortable as the slim Oral-B brush head. The Sonicare has a fat and elaborate interface between the base and the removable brushing unit, which is not as easy to keep clean as the slim and simple interface of the Oral-B. And the Oral-B brushing part of the two types of brush included in the box does a better cleaning job. Finally, we have battery disposal. The Sonicare has a non-removable Ni-Cad battery, so that in order to dispose of it properly at a recycling center I had to cut the base to access the battery. The Oral-B has a provision for removing the nickel-metal hydride battery (better than Ni-Cad), although the manufacturer wants you to stop using the unit when the battery dies, not to replace it."

There\'s a visible difference.There are some neat features as well.  It beeps to let you know when you can finish brushing a quadrant of your mouth (like the Sonicare), and a bright red light goes off when you push too hard.  Brushing too hard can wear away the gums, damage that can be very difficult & expensive to repair... if it is repairable.  (Unfortunately, we have a lot of personal experience with overagressive brushing.)We\'ve also tried the Sonicare in the past, and found the Oral-B to be superior.  The Sonicare didn\'t really do a good job of cleaning our teeth.  There are some parts, esp behind the front teeth, that Sonicare doesn\'t really do a good job of reaching.

The battery life on the toothbrush is really fantastic, I took a 2 week business trip and it worked the whole time.  I use the floss toothbrush heads and it leaves my teeth feeling clean and minty.  I really like the timer, although frankly it is not necessary as your regular wrist watch would work just fine.  I also like that you can put several toothbrush heads in the side container for up to four people.  You do have to be diligent about cleaning it because the dried up tooth paste and water can really cake on in there. Overall I\'m very pleased with this toothbrush."

There is no possible to this. It literally stripped my hair so bad that I wonder if I will ever get it quite right again. And I am not a woman of color, unless you call bleaching and coloring your hair blonde to pink to purple back to blonde or blue all year long.I really thought this product would help relax and condition my hair and somehow help it overcome the harshness from all the chemicals I used on it last year. I admit I was making progress with some herbal essence conditioner in the blue bottle that I used as a leave in and was honestly seeing improvemnts so far. I has shine & more length, less tangles, softness and hardly no frizzies.And then I saw this and assumed this was what I needed to get quicker instant results.WRONG! I wish I had never used this. I am set back 6 months now. My hair is dry, brittle, coarse, tangled, and frizzier than it ever was. This product has done more damage than my bleaching ever did! "

Yes, it has two settings but, it shouldn\'t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn\'t have to with their older model. The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting. There is also no indication that it is fully charged except by plugging it in when uncharged and timing it.  The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  I\'m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  I am now \'cost sensitive\' as I am only willing to spend so much to \'rent\' a unit for a couple of years (my older one lasted on the lower side of this equation) only to have to throw it and the useless, spare, brand new brushes I have away (it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit\'s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.On the plus side, it is very slim so it fits nicely in the hand and, I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once so, I suppose that jackhammer feeling of the brush obviously did not do any harm to the enamel as I had feared it would."

It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than \'brushing\' like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).2- It\'s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.3- If it pops out of your mouth while it\'s running, it doesn\'t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.4- It doesn\'t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever? I was told my gums are in much better shape than before.6- It\'s cheaper.  \'nough said."

In this case, it is somewhat reversed.  She has been using Venus razors for some time; absolutely insists on them to my dismay, as they are a good deal more expensive than any other disposable razor that I am aware of.  So, when the opportunity presented itself I decided to try it and see why she was so wholly sold on the product.I will preface my remarks on this razor by noting that I have so butchered myself with disposable razors in the past that I gave them up entirely for electric (which, I will note, are a good deal better than they used to be).  That said, for me this trial serves several purposes.1. How likely was I (or she) to cut myself with it?2. Did it provide a better shave than an electric?3. how does it compare to other disposables?I put off the test for quite a bit reminiscing on discovering a trail of blood as I left the bathroom (and having sworn the entire routine off years ago).It did pass the crucial first test.  I managed to shave my legs without bloodying myself.  I think the moisturizing pad helped here.  that said, I *really* do not like the moisturizer.  It smells like fabric softener to me :p and does not feel as good as either a real moisturizer (which you would use after you shave) or provide as much glide as other creams or gels.  I found it mildly offensive.  that took a star off.2. Compared to the electric, it was not as easy to use; involved a bit more fussing: insert (or, as one will ultimately have to) changing the blade.  It was a little bit of a closer shave, but also left my legs feeling scraped.... not as good as my skin felt on the leg I did with the electric (knock off one more star).3. Compared to other disposables, it is not any closer per se but may save one pass.  HOWEVER, the blades get much more clogged and are more difficult to clean than twin blade razors.When you think about it, really it is just one blade which is doing the cutting, the second or third is for what you miss on the first pass.Having tried it, do I think it is worth the extra cost?  NO (resoundingly) but sincerely doubt I will be able to reason with her ;)In sum, yes it shaves a bit closer than an electric.  All blade razors do.I found this one to be safer than most (a plus) but did not like the scent or feel of the moisturizer and my skin felt more raw than when I use the electric.I did not find that it provided a closer shave than other disposables, or permanent blade razors, and do find it harder to clean.In my view the positives and negatives more or less balance each other out and what you are left with is a very expensive disposable.  Myself, I will not be buying this product, though doubt my reasoning will have much impact on the shopping habits of my teenager ;)Edited to note that I brought this with me on vacation (more portable than an electric) and a week later have so many ingrown hairs; it\'s awful!  This never happened with any other razor I have used.  I will not be using it again (and will seriously discourage my daughter from same).  Who wants to risk infections or scars?  I don\'t!    "

Do you how much the battery in there is actually for.....$6-7 at the Batteries plus and $2-3 online.

This razor works just as well as they do. They glide smoothly over my skin, and leave my legs feeling soft. The only thing they seem to have changed is the razor holder, and I do NOT like it.The old razors came with a large holder that sticks to the shower wall and opens up to hold two spare razor heads. This new holder is MUCH smaller and suctions to the wall. You just slide the neck of the razor into the holder, and that\'s it. I\'m not sure why they changed this. I would think wall space in the shower isn\'t really something most people are trying save, and now, your spare razor heads have to be kept outside of the shower. To some this may not be a big deal, but I ALWAYS change to a new razor head while I\'m in the shower.Overall, I still love the razor and the job it does, but the new holder design is, IMO, no good. I ended up throwing it out and using the one I already had. I really like having the two extra blades in the shower with me so I can change it right when I need to.    "

I purchased mine from Zellers, from all the places in Toronto, Ont. Zellers was the only store that had them in stock, I could only assume the other more popular places like, Walmart and Shoppers Drug Mart were all sold out.At that time I had a chin strap with messy stubble on my neck and cheeks. So it was a perfect time to fix up my style.So I started with the trimmer, I love the feeling of the product, despite how cheap it cost, it surly does NOT feel cheap. The combs are easy to clip on and off. I used a size 2 to trim my chin strap down and looked great. The only downside i found with the trimmer is the numerous times i had to run thru the hair to make sure i got everything, I still ended up missing a few. Also the width is quite narrow but nothing to disappointing. Then i removed the comb and used the trimmer to line up my chin strap to easily shave around it, but it doesnt seem to trim close enough to do a line up.I moved on to the razor, I shaved around my chin strap, i love how smooth it glides across my face, but the shave was not very close as the disposable razors i was using before this. I had to go over a few times, still had missed spots and even going over that, it leaves a layer of very short stubble, no matter how often i go over it. Mind you i went with the grain, not against it. UPDATE: i tried shaving again, this time i applied more pressure to the device which did end up shaving alot closer but caused a bit of irratation on my neck. Its also not as smooth as it was the first time around, not sure why.Then i used the precision edging blade to finish off my style, used it around my strap to give it a final line up, didnt seem like it was doing much aswell, I had to shave the area a few times to actually get the left over stubble from the razor. I\'m unsure if its the product or i was unfortunate to have picked up a faulty one with a dull razor :\. So i plan on buying a pack of cartridges and i\'ll give this another go.So over all i\'m giving this a 3/5 for now, i will edit and update the info untill i give it another shot.UPDATE: Gave this item a second shot, in all honesty i like the product just because it does what it says it does. Don\'t expect a powerful device, considering its powered by a single battery. But its exceptional for the price, small, easy to storage, nice look and feel. Easy to maneuver. Its worth giving a shot. Im sure since this product was such a success, with all the positive feedback ive read through out numerous sites, they\'ll try to create a much better one in the near future.. at least i hope they do, cuz i\'ll def. be looking out for that one.  end result 4/5.

I love that they fit on any Venus razor; although, they best match the Divine handle because of the blue text on the blade. They\'re rounded so there\'s no sharp edges. However, they can sometimes be bulky when it comes to feminine curves. Because there are no wires over the blades, the Venus Divine razor is quite easy to rinse off. It doesn\'t have as many nooks and crannies which attract hair, soap or cream like the Quattro blades.Overall, I love the Divine razors. I always get a great shave on my legs and underarms. Those areas don\'t require any shaving cream with Divine\'s multiple moisture strips. I rarely cut myself and irritation around the bikini line and intimate areas is minimal when used with a good shaving cream. The comfort coated blades glide quite smoothly over the skin without catching or scraping, with help from the smoothing cushions. I believe both of those features are only on the Divine razor blades, not the regular Venus blades.The moisture strips add moisture you can touch to the blades (much more-so than the original Venus blades); although, it can feel a bit slimy if you leave it in the shower (the slimyness and moisture both fade over time). The moisture strips are supposed to fade when it\'s time to refill but I\'ve honestly never noticed it so I just replace when I feel like I am not getting an awesome shave anymore.    "

No perspiration when doing daily work in the office.  If you have an excess of perspiration in your arm pits, this is going to do a better job than most others.  The real benefit is that it doesn\'t go on white and clumpy.- Odor protection: 5 starsAll I can smell is this stuff - no odor is getting through this!- Scent: 3.5 starsA little strong for me, but not a terrible smell- Application: 5 starsGoes on smooth without clumping -- no white residue!

Despite the name change from \'Triumph\' to \'SmartSeries,\' there are no differences except for the charger-toothbrush-holding-stand, which has changed from a tall rounded design (which was a pain to assemble and disassemble) to a elongated flattened rectangle.  In fact, if you look at the handle of your SmartSeries 5000, it says, \'Triumph.\'  All of these toothbrushes are the same design, except the 9400 doesn\'t interface with the SmartSeries clock.I have noticed that the price point has stayed similar over the years, and now Oral-B is consistently including the \'SmartGuide,\' which is a little clock-like contraption that gives signals (e.g., time, time of brush, too much pressure, etc.).  This toothbrush is convenient and does a pretty good job of keeping your teeth much cleaner and whiter than manual brushing.  My dentist doesn\'t scold me as much during cleanings any more.One caveat: My husband\'s Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries) had a bearing go out within six months of normal use.  The SmartSeries clock would flash the \'red triangle\' (brushing with too much pressure) caution and the toothbrush would buzz uncomfortably throughout the brushing process.  Although the toothbrush originally cost us around $149, we couldn\'t find the original sales receipt in order to claim the warranty.  Finally, after complaining about it for a year-and-a-half, we accepted the hit to the pocketbook and replaced his malfunctioning Triumph 9900 with the SmartSeries 5000... which was surprisingly the same toothbrush despite the name change.In short:- The price at MSRP is the equivalent of 30 regular toothbrushes, but it does a very good job when it works- This toothbrush is a good buy from Amazon due to significant price decrease (major retailers are still selling it at MSRP)- The SmartSeries 5000 (with SmartSeries) is the same as the Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries)- Keep your receipt for potential warranty issues! Better to be safe than sorry, and $160 poorer due to replacement cost (like us)- 10 hours to fully charge, about 10 days of charge at 2x brushings/day- Standalone charger is convenient to detach from brush-holder for extra counter room or to take on trips"

5498,2325,2379,20101023,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 23, 2010",ARX9BYBD4DS4,An electric experience,"Once upon a time at a sink far far away I brushed my teeth with teeny tiny sonic waves.  Then one day the evil nemesis time took it all away as my Sonic powered toothbrush ceased pulsing its distinctive sound of a million mad mosquitoes.  My wife, as she is wont to do,never wanting anything to do with my inter-spatial toothbrush saw this as the opportunity to finally throw it in the trash. For days it lay in state at the bottom of the can. It was a vision of pure sadness as I knew that now, once again, my elbow must flex and my hand once again must clench the minuscule handle of (gulp)...a manual toothbrush. The thought of losing another energized brush kept me away so for years I maintained only memories of the mad mosquitoes that once blasted calculus to the oblivion. If I had only had that Sonic brush in Mr. Farkner\'s math class, I often thought, perhaps I would have passed. I spoke often to my wife about finding another sonic calculus blaster but this brought only glares. For, as I have previously stated, my wife hated every tiny sonic wave of it\'s tiny brush and nearly forbid it.As I sat in the body conforming chair of my dental hygiene adviser, mirror in hand, viewing my pearly off-whites the bad news came; word by grating word; \'You\'re a lousy brusher\'. These words came from a mouth I could not even see.  Was it true? Is this why she protected her mouth from mine with that veil? For the second time in my life I learned calculus is no fun as she told me I must return for two whole hours of scraping. And it was all my fault. \'This\' she proclaimed after quickly unveiling her mouth \'is an Oral-B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush. and it alone is the answer to your inadequacy\' Wow, it was a mouthful and I was not even sure I could utter that many words without removing the cotton from my cheeks but I still tried. \'A mmmpphh, mmmphh\'. I gave up protesting further only in my mind. \'But it has no sonic drive!\' I though. Seeming to read my thoughts she smiled and curled my fingers around the handle. \'It has modes, lots of modes, and the brush is big, big enough to massage your gums, and who doesn\'t like a gum massage...right?\' I pondered her words as she veiled her mouth again and scraped her way slowly through my calculus problems.As I left her presence, and all the way home on the bus, her words rang in my head. At the first opportunity I searched the World Wide Web for the best price and found a quick trip to the Amazon was in order. I pushed the right buttons and soon it arrived, wrapped incognito in it\'s brown cardboard box with that winky smile. Inside, nestled against it\'s plastic air pillow my new toothbrush rested from it\'s long journey. The air was electric as I pulled it from it\'s packaging and plugged it in. I hung it\'s cordless timer on the wall. I could hardly wait to massage my gums but the book clearly stated I must so I did. When morning came I grabbed the handle. No more clenched fist around a minuscule handle, this baby was large, form fitted to my hand and pulsed with excitement. I pushed the button . The brush came to life. Gone was the sound of a million angry mosquitoes on a mission of blood replaced instead with a sound of raw rotating power. The sound was humanly audible and no longer called dogs from every outside quadrant. At first my elbow still flexed back and forth, as though I were to do the work, but I soon learned I need only relax, position the brush over each tooth and let the Oral-B work. The timer on the wall counted up the seconds. Thirty seconds later the brushed pulsed on and off and I was off to attack a new quadrant.  In just two minutes I was done. The brush had solved my calculus problems for the day and the timer even smiled its approval. Awesome!"

The first few daysI used it, it felt like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  My teeth felt smooth and clean.  This is a awesome toothbrush, small round bristle head is better than the sonicare long shaped one, becuase you pay more attention toeach tooth and it\'s really fast and easy to use and brush.  Now I look forward to brushing everyday and I also brought one for my wife and three kids.Update:  I went to costco and they had the same tooth but a professional version, which cost more money and works the same.  My recommendation is that if you can afford it then get the professional version or if not, this one works just as fine and maybe even better since it saves you money."

If you hardly have any hair, you probably don\'t really need it.i have tried ***ALL*** the Venus collection and many others, so take it from a pro!!! i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far. First it covers a much larger area so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors. A few strokes and you\'re done. i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!! i read a reviewer\'s comment saying that Embrace is the same as a 1 blade razor. NO WAY!! this one doesn\'t even compare to the one with 3 blades!!it is so practical, you don\'t need to go over the same area more than once or twice. the smoothing \'bands\' (meant for exfoliation i suppose) seem to assist the shaving because they smoothe the area perfectly. i was TOTALLY IMPRESSED with this one. The head is very flexible so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts. i have a sensitive skin but it is hard to cut yourself with this one - unless you overdo it or if you have very little hair. You don\'t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).i read a review by a man who uses this razor, well i use men\'s foam! i DON\'T use the foaming gels made for women. they foam much less than men\'s products. i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target\'s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper prices.i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product. Venus Embrace, that is. i hate shaving, and this one definitely makes it less unpleasant for me.    "

I\'m done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave.  Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other \'detail\' parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front.  It just doesn\'t work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use.

Today it costs $60 on amazon while the Oral-B Pulsonic costs $47.  If you are in the market for a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I\'d say either of these would be a good investment.  Both have two settings, except it seems the Oral-B has the \'faster\' setting start first whereas the WaterPik starts a slower speed first.  The Oral-B is slimmer, lighter, easier to hold onto.  Both brushes come with base units but the unit for the Oral-B is smaller and lighter than that of the WaterPik, but it also is easier to push around by accident.  The WaterPik comes with 2 brush heads, the Oral-B, just one.  When recharging the WaterPik blinks and when it stops, you know it has been charged fully, the Oral-B does not.I have not experienced the trouble of the brush head falling off the Oral-B brush, and overall I would say that the Oral-B seems more \'powerful\' in its vibrations.  I can\'t say that\'s a bad thing, but after using the WaterPik for so long, it\'s something one has to get used to.  Overall I\'d say either electric brush is a good investment.  While you get a little more with the WaterPik, it is also a heavier brush and more expensive.  In the end, all they really do is vibrate and you have to move them around.  If I had a choice, I\'d probably choose the Oral-B (which I switched to as soon as I received it), only because it\'s slimmer and lighter and I find it easier to use."

I am obsessed with using it, for the FULL two minutes because of the just-been-to-the-dentist feel. I opted for the 55000 for the \'gimmicky\' timer which I absolutely love. When I travel I leave the timer at home and I always forget how long I\'ve been brushing. Is that vibrate the 2nd...or 3rd one? I can never remember because I usually try to do something else as I\'m brushing my teeth. So, for me, I love the timer.I love the feel of the 5000 over the 4000 (I bought my mom the 4000 for Christmas and she bought my Dad the same one).I always use the Floss Action head, it\'s by far my favorite.I was hoping this toothbrush would be a little quieter than it is but it\'s not outrageously loud. We have a master en-suite and with the bathroom door closed all the way and the rest of the house silent you can hear the toothbrush in the bedroom but it\'s not loud enough to wake my husband or myself up.I do share the handle of this toothbrush with my husband. Like some other reviewers have mentioned our battery life is not so great anymore. We can \'justbarely\' make it a week without having to recharge. It takes about 8-9 hours to charge fully.My biggest complaint is that within the last few weeks the red light on the timer (pressure sensing light) is almost continually on when we are using the toothbrush. I do need to find the manual and see if there\'s a way for us to calibrate or reset something. The toothbrush is still operating fine but I\'m afraid this issue is a sign of an impending serious malfunction."

The next morning I pulled out  an old unused single blade disposable I had for emergencies and it was much more comfortable then this one. I absolutely hate this razor, I ended up giving away the other unused blades. I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor. Felt great. Best shave ever. This did everyting that the Pro glide promised to do. I had no irritation of the skin and the shave was very comfortable and close.I would NOT recommend this razor at all. I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I thought that this was supposed to the best for sensitive skin...WRONG.Do yourself a favor and don\'t spend you money on this overpriced crap.

In the early 80s I had gum surgery because of it. I\'m supposed to go to the dentist every four months for a cleaning, but of course I don\'t go to the dentist near that often; maybe once a year if I\'m lucky. Anyway I always have a large plaque buildup when I finally do go to the dentist for a cleaning. The last several times I\'ve gone to the University of Pittsburgh school of dentistry where dental hygiene students do the work and the instructors check their work and correct the cleaning if necessary. Anyway I\'ve never had better cleanings in my life, but I still get severe plaque between cleanings. The last time I went the instructor recommended the Oral B 5000 toothbrush for my plaque problem. I thought I\'d give it a try and to say I\'m pleased is an understatement. I\'ve been using it now for five weeks after my last cleaning and as of yet I can feel no plaque buildup on my teeth. In the past by this time after a cleaning the plaque was starting to form when I used a regular toothbrush. I use the included timer and clean my teeth for a total of about 2 1/2 minutes. The feature I like is that you can get the molars clean. This was always a problem area for me in the past. Also the toothbrush will slowdown or stop if you press too hard. After a week or so you know what kind of pressure to apply and hone your cleaning technique. I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has a plaque or gum problem. One final note; I don\'t keep the charger plugged in all the time. I charge the toothbrush and can use it for eight or nine days before recharging. I\'m old school on this and feel the battery will last much longer if not charging all the time. I might be wrong on this, but I know at the very least it won\'t hurt battery life."

Heavy and extra heavy pads were never absorbent enough. The similar sized (i.e. extra thick) pads would not stay fitted properly and caused leaks. The thicker pads I tried also twisted around to adhesive side up which was both very uncomfortable and caused them to not absorb correctly, so was also messy. I am concerned about toxic shock syndrome so I do not use tampons. I tried every brand of \'overnight\' or \'extra heavy\' pads out there at the time and none of them were up to it. I found these about three years ago and have not tried another heavy flow overnight pad since.With these Always brand Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings I never have to use more than one at a time. I\'ve never had leaks when using these pads and I don\'t have problems with them twisting around to adhesive side up. If you have extremely heavy menstrual flow then you should try these pads.It is true that they are extremely long and very thick. The pad length is such that some cuts of underwear will be too small (or short) in the back if you place the pad correctly. This causes the pad to overhang or stick out of the back of the underwear. This is remedied easily, but can be inconvenient. If this is something that you cannot stand then you should not get these pads.Regarding price, currently Amazon is offering a two pack for about 12 dollars. I\'ve seen big differences in price depending on where you get them (between 12 -20 for one pack)this is the lowest price I have seen so far (about 6 dollars for one pack)."

I tried it on her immediately and can\'t say I noticed much difference. The odor is pleasant and the fine mist spray was adequate. It rinsed easily off of my hands, which is a major plus.The real test was my hair. I sprayed it down and just twisted it into several quick twists that I secured with bobby pins. I forgot about it for 2 hours and then removed the pins. Wow. My hair was so curly, more than I\'ve ever achieved even with a curling iron. The gel spray really held them without my hair feeling too crunchy or full of product. I  quickly gave myself a Medusa-style \'do with the curls going straight up off my scalp. I fluffed and frizzed it up. The volume of it was almost scary. Then I thought I\'d really test the gel spray. A few spritzes on my giant bunch of curls and immediately they unfrizzed and were easier to tame without losing all the volume.Ilove how versatile my hair suddenly feels. This gel was really fun to use when I felt the whim to change things up. I think it\'s inspired me to keep trying out something difference, since my hair has been straight and flat year after year.

Clearly they got the source of the stain wrong, and I\'m not so sure about the brush.My research led to the purchase of the Oral-B 3000.Oral-B and Sonicare seem the brushes of choice, and my research gave Oral-B a slight edge, though I\'m reconsidering. Reading reviews also gave the Oral-B floss action brush head a slight edge, and I\'m inclined to agree; though it certainly doesn\'t replace regular flossing, so far it seems to be keeping the staining abated.The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist\'s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. Primarily, the mode switch is a source of frustration, for the brush can not be shut off without going through all three modes. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000."

Oh, I have tried a few other products, just to see if something was better.  The Schick Quattro my wife gave me (after getting a coupon for a free one) found itself at the city landfill after 7 days.  I have a full, thick beard and fairly sensitive skin.  This blade cleans my face perfectly and I find it extremely rare to suffer a nick or cut on my face.  The handle is perfectly designed and bends to the contour of my face.  The blades pop in and out easily.  One drawback is that the blades are just a bit pricy.  But, the blades also last as long as three of the disposable blades I used to use.  The moisturizing strip could last a little longer, but it isn\'t a major factor for me.I gave this product a 5 because it is the best razor I have found.  I will keep trying to use new razors to see if someone can beat it, but, until then, I am staying with the Mach 3.    "

So goes my old fashioned \'manual\' toothbrush for a newfangled electric model. Okay, so I am not so old that I actually talk that way, but sometimes change is hard.As this is my first powered toothbrush, I cannot offer any comparison to models of old, but I can tell you that using the Oral-b 3000 is surely a different experience from just plain old brushing. First off, the round head shape definitely seems to do a great job of cleaning teeth; its shape allows for the bristles to envelope the tooth and I can feel its cleaning efforts at work. And, for those of you who have a tendency to scour their teeth with a toothbrush and scrape off the enamel, the Oral-b 3000 comes with a pressure sensor that will warn you when you are using too much force.Overall, my mouth feels cleaner after just a few days of use and I can tell it will likely make a difference in my dental hygiene.Something to note... If you have a high fear of dentists and their tools, then you should be aware that using the Oral-b 3000 will sound like you are in the dentist\'s chair. Nothing to fear, but it is a little shocking for the unprepared."

No matter how hard they try, Tampax\'s competitors never manage to reproduce the 100% hassle-free experience of Tampax. They always mess up one thing or another while Tampax manages to offer solutions to every single aspect of your menstruation.At the same time, in the world of Tampax tampons, Tampax Pearl, in my opinion, is the very best. It\'s the most comfortable, easy to use variety of Tampax. I think it\'s a brilliant idea to sell this kind of variety packs because you can just buy a 50-count box and use it for several menstrual cycles in a variety of situations.Tampax has surely done a lot over the years to make women\'s lives easier, and I salute them for it."

The speed seems to be much faster than the ones I owned earlier and the batteries seem to last a very long time, despite the fact that currently 2 persons are using the same unit. Three weeks on and I am still on the original batteries. I like the shape and the feel of these units, they are not cylindrical like the earlier ones I owned, and they are easier to grip.I am glad that these toothbrush are sold directly by Amazon.

I thought I was the only one who noticed this and switched to a Braun electric razor but if you read the other reviews you\'ll see that other men have done this as well.I got the Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver for $199.99 about a year ago, and periodically (right now for example) you can get $50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $130.00. So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I\'m def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need. I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream (have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $40.00 for a years worth) and I never get irritated skin anymore.So now I spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 = $225.00 for the first year and a half I\'ve used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing= $565.00So Gillette Fusion, or comparable manual razors, cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor. Most men might not change their blades as often as I did but the things got dull so quick I don\'t see how it could be avoided.    "

So this weekend I began to look into buying a new toothbruth when I came across all the articles about the fake brushheads.  Sure enough, the descriptions of the fake merchandise matched what I had.  So I\'ve been using fake heads for a year.  I contacted Amazon and after 30 minutes and having to speak to the manager they refunded only the ones bought directly from Amazon.  They said since I had purchased them so long ago this was a \'special exception\' they were making for me.  I don\'t even really care about the money so much as I care about taking responsibility for it.  Amazon should be at least somewhere responsible for the quality of their products and even of the resellers.  Refunding or contacting the reseller is the least they can do in my opinion.  The manager has forwarded my story to the inventory department and if I receive a call back I will update here.  Thanks everyone.Update: I haven\'t heard yet from Amazon, but I called Oral B.  They took this much more seriously.  At Amazon I got the feeling they thought I was scamming them, but Oral B took all my information, refunded me, and is looking into it.

So, while I\'ve had it a year, I\'ve probably used it a couple dozen times and the blade is just now starting to dull.  I agree with others that the trimmer on the reverse side is a gimmick, especially for a female who doesn\'t shave sideburns or nose hair.

I do not, however, like the pro white heads that came with the brush. I bought the precision clean heads and love those. They are made to work with the Vitality. This is only packaged and called the Vitality Pro White because it\'s the vitality model with pro white heads... Any heads made for Oral-B will work with this except for the Sonic heads.This brush is great, although it seems it\'s a bit underpowered. When brushing my back teeth and trying to get behind the tooth the motor isn\'t as powerful as it you were just brushing the front teeth but it\'s fine it still does the job just fine. I leave the brush on the charger when not in use so I can\'t attest to how long the battery lasts. Oral-B says that it will last 20 minutes or about 10 2-minute brushing periods. I personally think that\'s low for a modern electronic toothbrush but I leave it on the charger so I don\'t have to deal with a low battery.I brush at minimum 3 times a day. Usually more. I contacted my dentist asking if it was bad and she said that it\'s fine and I told her I was using the Vitality and she said that it was no problem, \'brush as often as you\'d like\'.. So I\'m not worried about gum recession or ruining my tooth enamel with it.I moved from a manual brush to the electronic brush and found at first that the vibrating (oscillating?) was making my gums and the tip of my nose tickelish. I\'ve gotten used to it and it doesn\'t seem to affect me like that anymore.I do drool a lot when brushing and the toothpasty drool goes down the handle on the brush and makes the handle a mess, so I rinse it off half way through and after brushing. The brush is completely waterproof, although I wouldn\'t submerge it...So all in all I really love this brush and rate it a 5/5. We\'ll see in 6 months how my brushing habits are when I go in for my next cleaning. I try to be very thorough and usually brush at least 3 minutes to make sure I get every nook and cranny so if I have tartar that is an unusual build-up I\'ll modify this review.I recommend this brush 100%!"

All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.I\'ll begin by saying that I\'ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.ProGlide vs. Hydro 5Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.What\'s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette\'s as a travel holder with no problem.Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro\'s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as \'suspension\' for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.On initial \'hefting\' the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.The Shave TestAll of the above are secondary to the \'Yes, But How Does It Shave\' test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream and a badger bristle brush.Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \'razor burn\' marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \'dried\' she still said the Gillette side was smoother.Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.ProGlide vs QuattroShave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.So what\'s not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn\'t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.    "

I mean, really, if you\'re a man and you\'re reading this, you probably already own/use Gillette products.  It\'s a given.  They really are the best.  They are also really the MOST EXPENSIVE.I used the regular Gillette Fusion for years now - and just made the \'leap\' to get the Fusion Power.  Why now?  I mean the blades are ridiculously expensive as it is, what\'s another buck or two on top of that?!Tried it for the first time today.  It works well.  The vibrating is a bit weird - it\'s like a hand massage while you shave.  Shaving doesn\'t feel like shaving.  That vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with.  It certainly is painless to use.  It worked well - my skin is smooth.  No telling if it\'s smoother than the regular Fusion.  How could you tell?  I don\'t know if it\'s a gimmick or what - but I did like it.  I\'ll continue to use it, since I bought the darn thing and have no choice.~ EDIT 4/23/2010:  I now hate this thing.  Here\'s why: Within one or two shaves, the \'lubricating strip\' is completely gone.  After that first shave with a nice new blade, it hurts like hell to shave with.  It\'s as if the vibrating effect speeds up the wear and tear on the blades!  It\'s horrible.  It truly is.  On the weekends, after a couple days growth, shaving with this thing is horrendous - I\'ve never had a more painful shave.  The vibrating thing is just a gimmick: aside from that first shave with a new blade, it\'s not nearly as good as the other non-vibrating shaving razors out there.  I find areas all the time that it just did a horrible job on - rough spots.  I can\'t use it on my upper lip - because the vibrating makes my lips chap!  Even turned off, shaving HURTS with this thing!  I\'m throwing it out.  I had this old spare new Schtick razor I keep around and shaved with that a few days ago - WOW.  It\'s awesome!  So smoooooth.  The vibrating thing is a total sham, folks.    "

I don\'t feel I\'m getting a shave that is any better or closer than I get with my regular, non-power Fusion.  And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly.

I was impressed with the quality of the pad; definitely explains why it cost more. Its actually quite thin compared to other pads that claim \'heavy absorbency\' , and the texture/density reminds me of  a makeup applicator sponge. The double wings was a good idea, but like some of the reviewers have mentioned- it did not seems to stick as well to certain underwear, and if it can\'t be relied on to stick well on EVERY underwear in your drawer, well- the reliability issue is moot already! And reliability is important if your are out and about, in and out of chairs, meeting with people constantly, and can\'t always run to the restroom when you feel that doomsday leakage- b/c then,  please don\'t rely on this pad.  When I have a heavy day- its heavy like Niagara Falls heavy where it feels like 1/2 pint just unleashes in one split second (sorry for the graphics, but I\'m trying to make a point, and those who have my type of heavy will know exactly what I mean), and this little fella just did not do it for me on a busy day when I don\'t have a restroom to run to. The absorbency rate on this high-tech pad is TOO SLOW for my type of \'Unleash thy furry\' Heavy days, and it just seemed to spill over the side like a shallow raft that can not contain its occupants (while going over the edge of Niagara Falls).  Every time I wore it on a heavy day, my underwear was dirtied to the extent where an extra pair of underwear was necessary! Does it sound gross? Yes- it was.  It you want to avoid grossness, do avoid this pad!  I saved the pad for my guaranteed light days and was able to finish my high tech pads in that manner, but I would not buy this again. Too bad- it does look and feel promising.  Hope my frank and honest review helps out any undecided non-tampon users."

From the moment I tried it, I despised this razor. The 5 blades make the experience worse than 1 because they take up so much room you can\'t get to certain spots on the face. Also, I go through these blades faster than I ever have with a single or 3-blade system. And lastly, the razor cuts my face. The 5 blades is supposed to make the experience easier but it doesn\'t. I never cut myself with 3-blade systems. Overall, this is a horrible razor and I encourage you to look to others.    "

I prefer the oral-b / braun non-sonic over the sonic models. I am a big fan of this style of toothbrush & have owned them for almost two decades. I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years) and this one is my favorite. The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \'brake light\' which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums. Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \'get all up in there\', but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful. I buy the \'extra sensitive\' heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I\'m not \'paying attention\'. Even though the other models had an \'indicator\' (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn\'t really enough to get my attention so I didn\'t reduce the pressure.When I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light - it\'s *really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall. (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom). But, the \'brake light\' was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and the light now only goes on every once in a while.They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing. This toothbrush with its \'brake light\' feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums & your teeth, and in turn, your health & well-being!PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, & healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon). I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)"

It took one try to conclude it was totally useless for my purposes.  I have a full beard that is cropped fairly close to the chin line.  I found the Fusion Pro Glide razor head too thick and bulky to perform any type of precision shaving at the edge lines.  Coupled with the trimmer as a handle, it was extremely awkward to use.  I attempted to use the battery operated trimmer along the lip line underneath my moustache and got nothing.  The trimmer is not sharp enough and does not get close enough to cut anything.  Trying to trim the rest of my beard with the snap on combs was an exercise in futility.  The trimmer head is too small and the 3 combs do not provide enough flexibility in terms of hair length.  All in all, I found this product to be a total waste of money.  The best part was the Duracell battery which I removed before throwing the rest in the trash.  Do yourself a favor and don\'t get taken in by s slick marketing campaign designed to sell overpriced razor heads.  If Gillette had spent as much money on the product as they did on the packaging it might be a different story.  There are a number of small rechargeable beard/moustache trimmers in the same price range that out perform this product and a variety of disposable razors that offer more precise shaving.  I\'d rather have a couple of products that perform well instead of one that does not.    "

I dropped my razor in the shower recently and the metal tabs that hold the whole thing together bent and tweaked the cartridge -- this had never happened in years of dropping store-bought Mach3s.  And it might be my imagination but it seems like I am needing to change blades more frequently, as if the blade is a poorer grade metal that dulls or corrodes faster.I can\'t prove it but I suspect Gillette is trying to phase out this product to steer consumers to a more expensive update, and is manufacturing a cheaper version for guys like me who cling to this product in hopes of avoiding the more expensive update, but the spotty quality will probably push me there eventually anyway.

The others I use have the plastic tabs you have to break off and then shake the blade out.  I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade.  It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill.

The extra clothing or heat induced perspiration was controlled 100% effectively by both products. Under stress situation (such as an important presentation), the Gillette Clinical Strength (GCS) did perform marginally better.

They are both in the same antiperspirant family as far as any wikipedia or dermatology website explain. The MSS contains 15% active ingredient, while the GCS contains 20% active ingredient. So in summary one additional swipe with the non clinical product gives you as much protection as a \'clinical strength\' product. The clinical product contains 1.7 oz vs 2.7 oz (40% less) for regular and costs over twice as much. For basically same product??? So do the math, and apply one more swipe of your regular product. You will get the same protection at lower cost. Its not that the Gillette Clinical Strength is bad, but it pricing takes advantage of peoples self consciousness about sweating. It should only be 33% more expensive based on the concentration for equivalent weight.    "

I\'d had a not-so-good experience with the Quattro, so I was a little wary when I discovered this one had even more blades.My experience with the Fusion: It does grab the stubble and take it off slightly better than the M3 Power, but ONLY shaving counter to the direction of the beard growth.  When I shave, I usually mix my strokes up and down, and found that this razor did not remove the beard as well as the M3 Power when shaving on the downstroke.  So I had to restroke my face on certain areas which remained rough after the initial shave, which actually added to my shaving time.  I can only assume the other reviewers who said shaving time was decreased, use only upstrokes when shaving.Second, I was very disappointed when the blue indicator strip disappeared completely right after the first shave.  Refill blades are more expensive than the M3 Power, which usually last me 2 or 3 shaves at least.The last con I have is that the battery button is a bit too sensitive and placed exactly where I like to hold the razor with a firm grip.  Twice while I was shaving I accidentally switched it off.Conclusion:  I would use the Fusion to shave only for special or formal occasions, because of the cost of replacement blades and the shaving style needed for optimum work outweigh the benefits of the slightly better shave I could get.For regular everyday shaving, I\'m sticking with the M3 Power.

Ths brush is relatively inexpensive, but it also feels inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.Pros:-It works. The product came out of the package, charged, and worked without a fuss. The worst part of setup was the anti-theft plastic package.-Inductive charging base. The case is 100% waterproof sealed, and power is drawn by setting the brush on a holder base so that power is transferred with no risk of electric shock. Very nice.-The brush pulses a couple of times to let you know when you\'ve done your time. Brilliant.-And it comes with an extra basic brush head.Cons:-Rattles your head like a jackhammer, negating most of the positives the moment it touches your teeth. The motor is relatively slow and cheap, so until you\'ve used it for a while and learned to adapt you\'ll be concerned that it\'s going to knock your teeth out before you\'re done cleaning them.-Standard brush head is only okay. You get the most basic brush head out of the box, which to me feels only so-so for cleaning. I sometimes have to run my brush for an extra cycle to feel really clean.Overall, if you want to try a power brush but you don\'t have the money for a more expensive model, this isn\'t a bad choice- it\'s still better than a manual brush. However, in the realm of power toothbrushes, you can and should do better. When you weigh a lifetime of painful dental cleanings and potential surgical issues from cavities against the (hopefully) one-time investment in a good power brush, there\'s really no reason to stick with an underpowered model like this that\'s going to rattle your teeth like it does.However, I\'m still going to be reusing this model for a long time to come- craft and cleaning experts know that there\'s nothing like a cheap power toothbrush for doing tasks like detail cleaning leather. For this application, this is an absolute wonder of a brush. It\'s cheap, and all the jackhammering works just fine when it\'s done on something other than your head."

If one trusts the packaging, it out performs a manual toothbrush.  If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It\'s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one\'s teeth during brushing.I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one\'s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.So, it\'s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs."

The turning mechanism on the bottom can be frustrating because when you first use it it is difficult to make it work. Another problem is that it is really messy. While applying it you have to keep turning the bottom wheel for more gel to come out which can get annoying. After you are done it really messy and easy to get on your hands, chest, and even the actual container. However it is a very strong and powerful deodorant. It felt great and I could smell it\'s freshness the entire day. Without applying too much even it worked exceptionally well. This is the first time I\'ve ever used a gel deodorant, and I think I might just stick to it. If it\'s possible you should buy an individual one before you get a multi-pack to try out.

I never cut myself, and with the little gel strips on the top and bottom you barely need shaving cream for the first few uses (but, use it anyway- it\'ll last longer). These razor blades will last for months if you need them to. When I don\'t have the money to throw at these things I have used one razor for months. It\'s not the most comfortable shave you\'ll ever have but it\'s better than a four blade lol. These certainly are expensive but if you shave quickly, or tend to cut yourself it will be worth the expense.Tip: When you\'re done using it, don\'t place it blade down on anything. The gel strips will be used up much more quickly and will attach themselves to the surface they are placed onto (don\'t worry, not permanently).    "

Well, maybe for a year or two in high school, but that\'s another story. I know that the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Conditioner is not intended for my kind of mane. But I figured, \'What the heck, conditioner is conditioner\'. I realize that isn\'t entirely true, but I certainly didn\'t think it could hurt.What I right? Yes! In fact, I have to say that the Pro-v Curly Hair Conditioner is one of the better after shampoo products I\'ve used. At around five bucks a pop, it isn\'t a bargain brand, but is less then many of the middle to high-end conditioners. I confess that I don\'t often use a conditioner unless it is a 2-in-1 version combined with a shampoo, but I do use my wife\'s from time to time. This Pantene Pro-v has all but the top-tier stuff beat.Granted, I don\'t have curly locks so I can\'t comment on how it works for the intended hair type, but for my short to medium straight hair, it\'s just dandy. My hair varies from one to six inches in length and after using the Pro-v conditioner; it was noticeably soft and manageable. No frizz to speak of. My wife\'s longer tresses like it too. She has wavy hair and her use of it produced similar results -- very soft, lots of body, no frizz. She was pleased. We\'d both recommend it for any hair type.If I had to change one thing, it would be to tone down the scent. It is not unpleasant and I enjoy smelling it on my wife\'s hair, but it isn\'t very masculine. I realize however I don\'t quite fit the target market for this product, so I can live with it.

Smooth, silky, hairless legs are a good start.  And the Gillette Venus Embrace Razor is the pefect razor to leave a sun-loving lady\'s long legs lovely and smooth.I was very impressed with this razor.  The 5 Curve-Hugging Blades glided over my legs and around the more delicate curves (let your mind wander).  Unlike other razors, I did not have to shave twice to remove all unwanted follicles.  One pass did the job and left my legs nbelievably smooth.  The Protective Ribbon of Moisture that surrounds the blades allowed them to glide over my legs, around my ankles and knees, and left my skin feeling as if I had just put lotion on it.The razor is light-weight, easy to hold, and feels good in the hand.What I liked best about this razor was the Shower Pod, the nifty little container that holds the razor and spare blades.  The pod has suction cups that allows it to be placed in the shower - without taking up precious space for my other necessary beauty products.  I placed the pod on one wall of my shower three weeks ago and it is still firmly in place.  It has not fallen once.I highly recommend this razor to all of my sisters in bikinis, preparing for the summer season, or those women who have been stealing their husband\'s blades (totally guilty here).

It\'s amazing how few razors meet this criteria. The new unpowered Gillette Fusion razor does this better than the older Gillette model it replaced.For me, my beard tends to outgrow razors. I can live with one for a few years and then, suddenly, I find it no longer gives me a close shave. That\'s when I know it\'s time to change.What\'s different with Fusion is I need hardly any effort to remove facial hair and don\'t need much pressure from the hand or wrist. Just get the thing on my face and move it and it does the job even on my chin, under my nose, off my jawbone and in those other spots where lines are hardly flat or straight. The razor has another cutting edge on the back you can use for straight cuts to sideburns or elsewhere,  if you choose.I cut myself a few times the first time I used Fusion and was concerned the five cutting edges may be too much for me. But I quickly adjusted by releasing the pressure in my shaving hand and now take a close shave sans cuts for granted every morning of my life.Ergo, this razor meets my only criteria expertly. I\'d recommend this product to anyone that wants what I want, a close shave without cuts.    "

Also just like the old Fusion blades, you have to be really absent minded to get a nick. I\'d say on average I get about 4-10 shaves out of them before I become frustrated and throw them away.

At the time, the price was about $18 or so and I thought that was a great deal since these razors usually retail much higher.The razors showed up and I noticed a number of particular differences between my used old blades (bought from a supermarket). First the blade seemed a bit dull and dry when I shaved using the first blade in the package. It was so bad I had to throw it out immediately and tried the second..And then a third blade, etc..Needless to say ALL the blades were terrible..ALL THE BLADES! I found it strange that out of 16 blades, I wasn\'t even able to get one good shave and had to go buy the blades at full retail cost in person at a supermarket, and use my old turbo blade in the meantime. Another thing I noticed was the blue strip seemed to be made out of plastic and was not lubricating.Today is July 18, 2010 and I was thinking of buying some blades since I ran out and the price seems pretty reasonable...But then I noticed many reviews here with zero stars and talk of fakes.. Looks like I wasn\'t the only one.I am not sure where these reviewers bought their blades from (Marketplace or directly from Amazon) but I can say this:I bought my blades directly from Amazon, its a verified purchase and after reading the reviews here I think they sold me fakes.Thanks Amazon..Check your suppliers.

My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why. Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:- practically no assembly required, it\'s ready to go out of the box- comes with a deck for the charger and slots for 4 heads. Storing the head keeps it cleaner, and you can use this brush for the entire family - just get different color heads and you\'re set.- all you have to do is move the brush around, no pressure needed. In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.- the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles- I love how sensitive the power button is. With CrossAction, I had to jam the button to get the brush going. With the 3000, you literally just tap it.- the brush takes about 17 hours to charge fully, and last for a week. However, I just keep it on the charger all the time since you can\'t overcharge it.The only thing that I\'m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space.

Well, after three weeks of using this toothbrush, I\'ve noticed hardly any plaque in that problem-area!  My husband is so impressed that we purchased extra brushheads for him to try it out and he\'s sold as well.There are three brushing options.  1) regular 2) sensitive 3) whitening.  I tend to always brush on the third level of Whitening.  I really like the light up indicator telling you that you are pressing too hard.  Also, there is a timer that vibrates when you should move to the next quadrant of your mouth.The stand and charger are also a nice perk.  The stand comes with 4 compartments to store the brushheads, as well as the charger stand.

It is too early to evaluate the long-term benefits promised by this product, but I find it a very simple and practical design, easy to store, clean and use. It is slim in the hand and very lightweight, most of my earlier experiments were thick and bulky, and cumbersome to navigate around the mouth. Like brushing your teeth with a flashlight.The Oral-B has a good feel to it, natural and well-balanced, and that makes me more likely to pick it up instead of a \'manual\' brush. The brush itself is rather petite, but this makes getting into tight areas a little easier. The noise was startling at first, a shrill buzz that reminded me of another reason I never took to electrics: it shatters the quiet ritual of morning and evening brushing.But if it works, it will be worth it. I  have so far found the single biggest complaint is that my usual rather aggressive style of use needs to be restrained, or the brush head will twist off of the body. It\'s a � turn quick release, and this is great for cleaning and sanitizing, but it seems to pop off in the mouth rather easily. How the bristles survive until I learn a gentler touch remains to be seen. I have to remember it\'s like running a polishing tool, not a backhoe.The unit is totally sealed and waterproof, as is the charger-base. Makes clean-up a cinch, and with induction charging connection, no pesky exposed electrical connections. Pretty much standard these days, I would expect. Another small but obvious feature that you\'d only notice if it was not there: the motor shuts off upon return to the base, like hanging up a phone.It has two speeds, \'normal\' and \'sensitive\'. I find normal is probably better to use, it tickles quite a but but it is not too hard to get used to. I use the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant. I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits. A double-blip signals the end of the session, as does a mouthful of hyper-foamed toothpaste. Try not to drool, OK?"

I preordered this razor with the hopes it would be better than the original fusion. I am happy to say from my experience that it is to me. This razor has no pull on a three day old beard along with no nicks or cuts, this must be due to the thinner finer blades. This is why they call it the pro glide. The lubrication strip is a lot bigger than the original and the diffrence is slightly noticeable during the shave. There was no stubble left over with a second pass. I have never tried the fusion power due to I feel that it is sort of a gimmic with the vibration in ways that other power razors have cut me or tugged at the beard so I stick with the manual. So far i am very pleased with this razor and even ordered the blade refills already. I will never even look back at my old fusion now due to the upgraded comfort and longer lasting blades of proglide. One reviewer feels that this razor is not much of an upgrade from the original and to stick with the original fusion but I beg to differ strongly. The old fusion is nice but no where compares to the proglide. It is definately worth the almost $11 for the best shave I have found so far!    "

I brush and floss at least once a day, maybe two if I have time.  Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.Then this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information - you find out that the brush tells you how to time your brushing.  It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  Yes, and further, the brush signals you to change.Quick reminder, after you put the toothpaste on your brush, press it to your teeth before turning it on, otherwise you get to spend some time cleaning toothpaste off the bathroom mirror, walls, and perhaps ceiling.  One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over the entire area - front, bottom, back, and gumline.  After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.  I was impressed.After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  I rinsed, and looked in the mirror.  To my surprise, I could already see a change in my teeth.  It was slight, but noticeable to me.  After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost."

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.    "

Why it took so long for me to buy an electric or battery powered toothbrush is beyond me. However, I\'m glad I finally woke-up and bought this \'Oral-B Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\', I\'ll never buy another manual toothbrush again.It\'s a Great Toothbrush. Buy it, you won\'t regret it.It comes as advertized with two AA batteries, just plug them in and you\'re ready to go. It has a neat 2 minute timer, which by the way is a long time when you actually start brushing. And that\'s a good thing.I got one tiny, insignificant gripe, it\'s hard to see the (+ -) battery polarity on the side of the toothbrush after removing the battery cap. When I installed the batteries the first time it wouldn\'t start, so I had to switch the batteries around, and now I have to remember the correct installation the next time I add new batteries. It\'s nothing to lose sleep over.Speaking of battery caps, removing the batter cap may be a slight problem for those people who suffer arthritis of the hand but it\'s do-able. You have to \'squeeze hard\' the two rubber spots on the sides, at the bottom of the toothbrush to release the battery cap. With that said, that too can be a good thing, because that means the battery compartment is airtight and waterproof.The ON/OFF switch is covered in some type of rubbery, waterproof membrane and is very responsive; quick on, quick off. The brush itself has a nice weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. Has the right amount of balance as well.The handle is made of two types of materials: rubber and a very smooth plastic, there\'s enough rubber on the handle so you don\'t have to worry about it slipping from your hands, even when wet. The package doesn\'t mention anything about what type of bristle comes with this toothbrush (i.e., soft or hard bristle), however, I felt NO irritation or discomfort what-so-ever.The overall length is 8-inches; brush head length is about 2.75-inches, width of the handle is about 1.5-inches X 1-inches.There are four different styles of toothbrush refill heads available for the \'Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\':1)Oral-B \'Precision\' Clean Brush Head (which comes with this toothbrush)2)Oral-B \'Pro White\' Replacement Brush Head3)Oral-B \'Dual Action\' Premium Power Toothbrush Head4)Oral B \'Floss Action\' Brush HeadI plan on stocking up on all 4 refills.

Then again, other dentists have said they\'re nothing special, and careful brushing using a regular toothbrush is just fine. Anyway, I certainly can\'t seen any harm in trying one and after just a few days of use so far, I\'m already beginning to think it was a worthwhile decision.The Oral-B 3000 is easy to use, feels reasonably solid in hand, and is simple to keep clean (it\'s nice that the brush can be removed quickly to rinse out). I was a little nervous the first time I tried it, expecting bleeding gums or soreness, but in fact the opposite has been true. Because there\'s no need to scrub hard, it\'s actually quite gentle, though the sensation is a little strange at first and it took me a few tries to get used to it. I felt it was really getting my gum-line clean, and because they recommend just two minutes (30 seconds per \'quadrant\') I was actually more aware than I usually am with a regular toothbrush about reaching every corner of my mouth and teeth... I guess with no \'instructions\' and years of just using a normal toothbrush, it\'s sometimes easy to forget what we learned as children when it comes to brushing our teeth!So, I\'m happy so far. My mouth and teeth have never felt so clean immediately after brushing (note, that \'clean\' feeling of course quickly disappears once you eat again), though the way the device vibrates against my jaw is a little perturbing, but I\'ll just have to get used to that. I\'d have liked to have seen a few more brush heads supplied with the product as I feel those will get expensive. I noticed the Oral-B site mentions this product coming with four different brushes, but the package states that we only get the one. There appear to be a variety of different brushes available, but I\'m not sure how useful they all are... I\'ll probably stick to just the original one as it already does a better job than a regular brush at polishing my teeth, and I\'m not sure how well the other ones would work. There is one brush with two heads though, that could be interesting to try and might clean even better. Fortunately, these replacement heads are not horribly expensive online, despite being considerably more than a normal toothbrush and lasting about as long. Still, it\'s a small price to pay for that \'clean teeth\' feel, I think."

Now I\'ve tried this Gillette Fusion Power razor at a cost of about $12 with Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges, 8-Count Package costing about $20.For the extra $3 for the razor, it cannot be beat. Gillette has raised its own bar for excellent shaving. This razor has five blades instead of three, guaranteeing the closest possible shave with several cool features. The blue lubricating strip turns white when the blade reaches the end of its use. It comes with a AAA battery that fits in the ergonomically slip-free grip handle (with a low battery light indicator). This vibrates the five blades at a high rate to ensure a very close shave. The microchip in the handle turns the razor off after eight minutes. Plus, on the back side there is a `precision trimmer\' blade that cuts those sideburns exact and is gentle enough to trim around your moustache, goatee and nose. Gillette claims each disposable blade will last up to a month, but I have found Gillette blades (the three blade version) to last three weeks. So I expect this five blade version to last well past a month. That\'s amazing.The Gillette Fusion handle costs $3 more and the refills (8) cost $10 more, but they last longer and the shave is so much closer.

One brush cleans with a rotary action, the other with an up-and-down action. It feels like my teeth are getting a more thorough brushing, and I find the vibration of the brush to be a pleasant sensation. But these heads may be best for people with large mouths. My wife prefers the single action heads because she has trouble inserting and manipulating the brush head in her smaller mouth.

Either it works or it doesn\'t right?Well in the case of this toothbrush I feel a difference. I\'m not someone who generally goes out of his way to brush my teeth. I don\'t floss, I rarely use mouthwash, and I brush once a day. I figure my teeth can make do. Well after trying this toothbrush my teeth actually feel a bit cleaner than usual. The cost is there though for the initial toothbrush system and I\'m sure replacement heads are equally as expensive so it may not be worth it if you brush often.You do leave with a somewhat polished feeling so it\'s worth a try at least if you\'ve never used a power brusher. It really depends on how much money you want to invest in your teeth. If you\'re like me you\'ll like it but it\'s probably not worth it in the long run."

This is one of my rare exceptions.  So why am I do ing this?  Last April I developed a blood clot in my right calf as well as a small one just above my knee.  As is usual in these cases, I was placed on the anticoagulation medicine Warfarin (the generic form of Coumadin) for six months.  This past saturday I was officially taken off Warfarin.Why do I bring all this up?  I was told in April that I was going to have to be very careful not to cut myself shaving.  If I did, I might have a great deal of trouble stopping the bleeding.  I had bought this razor literally the week before my blood clot.  I had been using the Mach 3 before this and often cut myself using it.  I was somewhat dubious about using this new razor and its five blade, but I liked the very, very close shave it gave me.  So I stuck with it.  The result?  In six months I did not cut myself a single time.  This is far and away the best razor I\'ve ever used.  It gives an amazingly close shave and protects my skin from scraping or cutting better than anything I\'ve ever used.So thanks Gillette for not making me find out what cutting myself when shaving would have been like.

This toothbrush is far superior to regular brushing.  Your teeth feel so clean afterwards.  I recommend using this product fully and then trying the FlossAction head.

The reviews and the rebate attracted me to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. I especially liked the polishing mode, since I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth. I didn\'t think that I\'d use the clock/timer/sensor, but I decided to put it up to have a small clock in my bathroom. I\'m using it all of the time! I give my teeth a \'spa treatment\' - floss, polish, massage gums...and feel like I\'ve had a professional cleaning. Having always been a diligent brusher, I was surprised to see that I could benefit from the reminder to brush each of the four areas for 30 seconds. The little warning light that tells me when I\'m exerting pressure (and thus brushing too hard - all you have to do is hold the brush up to the surface of the tooth and let it do the cleaning) is useful for breaking a bad habit that seems to crop up in the same place quite often.I even like the smiley face as a reward for good brushing, although I usually tend to be rather jaded about such things. I think that I\'ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. And I\'m also glad for the travel case since I hated to make trips without my Bruan (you just can\'t got back to manual brushing after you\'re brushed this well), but I\'d find that the \'on\' button sometimes got pressed in my luggage and used up the charge. The base for the Oral-B is also small enough to pack easily."

I have never once had a cut with this razor.Evidently the battery vibration system in concert with the three bladed razors works well. I also get the smoothest shave I\'ve ever been used to. Tip: Run the blade with the whiskers, then make another pass lightly \'against the grain\'. You\'ll wind up with completely smooth skin, no razor burn, and no cuts.The blades are pricey, but in my experience last longer than the blades I\'d used for decades before. When you beging to feel any pulling at all, they are ready to change. Under normal circumstances you won\'t feel this shave against your whiskers at all. You can use the blades for a while after you start to feel a pull ... it still does the job and will just feel like your old razor did.This razor and these blades give me the most comfortable shave above the lip that I\'ve ever experienced. I have a pretty bristly bit of whiskers there, and have experienced lifelong pain shaving that area. I do get a pull feel there even with this razor with new blades, but no pain, and a relatively easy pass to shave there. I do not use the \'against the grain\' tip there tho, LOL, just a second pass with the grain but with a bit of extra pressure to get it close.I\'ve used this razor for a few years now and am delighted. I haven\'t tried the newer Fusion, but feel no need to.    "

Haven\'t had a cavity (or anything other than regular cleaning) in 12 years. Coincidentally that\'s how long I\'ve been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush. After I had been using it a year the Dental Hygienist remarked, \'I have to hunt to find things to do in your mouth\'...so I started getting my teeth cleaned once every 2 years. This saves time and money and, to me, this is a good thing in this economy. This type brush head is doing a good job.

For one thing, the brush\'s head is larger than the Sonicare\'s. This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.The one positive thing is the toothbrush\'s compactness.

858,438,448,20080805,B000277P5E,5,"August 5, 2008",A29WWNOYAM96QB,Real Mach3 Turbo razor blades are great! BUT Watch out for fakes!,"First, I want to explain that I gave 5-stars because this is a product review and this product is excellent as a razor blade. HOWEVER, be careful where you buy it from, some sellers especially on ebay and amazon (third parties) are selling FAKE blades. It\'s hard to recognize at first but you can tell from a few things:1. If you are familiar with Gillette shave, you will feel the difference immediately. For example, my one-month old genuine Gillette razor still shaves better than a fake one.2. Lubricating strip on the fake one is not real. So, how do you know it? With real Gillette product you can immediately feel there is a lot of lubricant (a little sticky moisture feeling), BUT with the fake one, your face will feel very dry even when you used the blades for the first time. Because they are not lubricating! They are fake strips and made out of some plastic kind material.3. Even after many months of use, If you try to remove lubricating strip on your real Gillette product, you can see that there is still a lot of lubricant just under the strip and on the strip itself. And this strip is a one piece well-aligned strip, easy to remove and easy to put back. BUT, if you remove the fake one\'s strip, this just plastic kind strip will break into parts and you cannot put it back in place.4. If you have a good eye, look closely to see if all three blades are leveled and adjusted as parallel to each other. Usually, on the fake ones, you will see a slight misalignment, basically they are out of line and think about it, what it can do to your face. Check all the blades in the box individually. None of them should be misaligned.5. Look closely to see small black dots on the blades. Original Mach3 blades have a little larger dots and their paint does not feel as precise as the fake ones. This is because, real ones have an almost invisible clear coat but you can see it if you look at the black dots directly.6. Look at the blue plastic strip just under the blades, now try to abuse them with the tip of your fingernails (Be careful do not cut your fingers).They are many micro-aligned plastic lines, and When you do this, they re-align themselves immediately without no damage to themselves. BUT on fake ones, they try to align back, but they can\'t! They always leave marks on abused spots on them.7. Look at the front side of blades. Just under the moving head, you will see five parallel lines on the plastic stable part. On the real one the line in the middle is slightly thicker than other ones. But on the fake one they may show difference. And the fake ones, usually (not always) a little darker in color of plastic, if you have good eyes.8. Now a little flexibility test. You know Mach3s has flexible heads. Fake ones, too... However, if you move the head with your finger to the back, it should come back to the original place with a smooth movement. On the fake ones, they come back but they come back quicker than the real ones. And fake ones even make a slight plastic sound when coming back.9. Look at the plastic cartridge holder if it has serial number printed on it. If so, it still DOESN\'T mean they are real. Nowadays, they are putting serial numbers on fake ones, too. So, follow the first 8 steps, to make sure you have the real ones.Nowadays, fakes are so close to real, I hope this review helps to all of you. I know some of the sellers who sell fake ones will find this review not useful. BUT using genuine razors is a health issue so be careful. And always buy from reliable sellers. Amazon itself is very reliable but be careful with other third party sellers. Read their reviews first!    "

After trying their Custom Plus3 and being extremely disappointed, I decided to give Sensor3 a try. They are exponentially better than Custom Plus3, but they still don\'t come close to the original Custom Plus as far as the quality of the lubrication strip and overall comfort are concerned. The razor tends to drag on your skin, leading to razor burn. Why Gillette can\'t use the same quality lubrication strip on Sensor3 as they do on the Custom Plus twin is beyond me. I would also prefer a non-pivot head to give me better control over the shaving angle, but that\'s more of a personal preference. It does not do all that great of a job on the chin and directly under the nose. The angle of the blades does not allow for good surface contact in these areas and can lead to nicks. Also, for my beard, each razor is single-use regardless of the brand, so I need to get the most bang for my buck. These come in a bit on the high-priced side, so that reflects negatively as well. I\'d give it 5 stars for the quality of the shave, subtract one star for the price factor (Amazon\'s price here is *ridiculous*! You can easily get these for 30-40% less in any store, but that is still expensive on a per-razor basis) and subtract one more star for the not-so-great lubrication strip (better than Custom Plus3, but still not as good as it could be). Overall, I will continue to use these, in conjunction with the original Gillette Custom Plus.    "

It\'s not as effective as previous Venus style blades. The good part is it\'s nearly impossible to cut yourself with this head. It is so wide, and the blades so recessed, that they don\'t really scrape the skin the way you expect. For those used to using the larger Venus blades, this will take only a little adjustment, because it\'s a little wider than the earlier models. For those used to normal shaving heads, this will seem odd and will take quite a bit of adjustment. I don\'t know about using it on more delicate spots - I don\'t think I\'d try.The blades are spaced so that they are surprisingly easy to rinse and they don\'t clog. The handle is probably the best Venus has produced so far. The shower pod is ok - the suction cups actually stick to the wall as they should and it holds a couple of spare blades.If you have trouble with nicks, or if you have boney areas around your knees or ankles, I think you\'ll like this set-up. For my part, it\'s ok, but I\'ll be sticking with the previous Venus blades, which are the best available, and give a closer shave. I might nick myself once in a while when I wouldn\'t with this one, but it\'s worth it to me to get the closer shave. Someone with more sensitive skin might prefer this model, and the moisturizing strips are just right - not too \'gloppy\' but still improving the \'glide\' factor.    "

I was looking to buy an electric toothbrush when I came across this at a local store.  The price caught my eye, and so I went home to do my research.  There wasn\'t much info/reviews at the time, but what was out there was positive.  So I went back the next day and got it.  After using manual toothbrushes for our entire lives, my husband and I were very surprised how much cleaner our teeth felt.  Like I said, we have never used an electric one before, so this is not a comparison of other electric toothbrushes.  My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual so it\'s not that important to me.  I am still amazed at the length of the charge, we can go a week with two people using it twice daily.  The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  I have found some info about defective and/or counterfit heads.  It is still going strong after almost 2 years of daily use, with no sign of lessening power or charge.  Overall, I think the price and quality of this toothbrush make it a great option."

I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this product.First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910. This electric toothbrush was great. I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare. My only gripe was the replacements are a bit on the pricy side. Moving on, I decided to replace the Sonicare (gave to my wife) with the Oral-B 3000. My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line. Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.As an owner of both, I find them similar in a sense, that they are both out (the toothbrushes of course) to perform the same job. The Sonicare did its job just fine. However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch. Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it\'s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.Onto the Oral-B. This brush has performed great. The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease) so I don\'t bleed as much. The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare and I really see no difference other than the size of the head. Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean). I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip. Although, it\'s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work. Plus, I always rinse the brush afterwards with hot water.The battery life appears to be great. I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days. The vibration and strength is great the company claims (40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute). The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \'off\'.The toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation. The build quality seems good to me. I have dropped this toothbrush three times over the span of three months and the electric toothbrush survived without any visual damage or cracks.The charging does take quite some time until it is fully charged. However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night. Therefore, the brush has hours of charging before its next use. One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG. This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first. Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit. Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don\'t even really notice it.In closing, I like this toothbrush. I gave it four stars because while I think it\'s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let\'s face it, it\'s a toothbrush right? Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road). Both the Oral-B and the Sonicare, have their difference. But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease. I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I do.And remember, I do NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can\'t go wrong either way."

I\'ve used a lot of razor blade types over the years, and while the Mach3 Turbos are a substantial improvement over the Sensor line, I can\'t imagine razors improving significantly beyond this. I\'ve used the Fusions before and while they\'re great, I don\'t get the sense that that extra blade is really doing a lot.Some people seem to shave daily with no issues, but some of us aren\'t so lucky. That\'s where the Mach3 razors really shine - the shave is close, but gives the least amount of irritation of any razor I\'ve used. If you have problems with your razors leaving your face feeling raw, you can do all sorts of stuff (better shaving cream, soaking your face in hot water, etc.), but at the end of the day, it all comes down to your razor. Your best bet is with the Mach3, or the new Fusion. They are both comfortable and without any major faults.    "

I\'ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them. They were loud, heavy and large in the hand. I was hesitant to try a power toothbrush again, but my dentist suggested it was time to cave and get another. So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush. It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud. I especially like the additional small brush head that comes with it. The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth. The small size of the brush is also great for travel. For short trips I just pack the toothbrush with a regular brushhead cover. For longer trips, I throw in the base and the brush. The base is not too large, so it is not a huge annoyance to pack. My one complaint (and thus the 4 stars) would be that it does not come with a travel case. Seems kind of odd since its size makes it a great travel power toothbrush."

What\'s that?  Five blades, you say?  Why, it must be better than four!  Meh.I have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck.  The good news is that, while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the problem.  In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades).  The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area).  If you have sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you.Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra \'trimming\' blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.However, the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast.  Considering my rather fine hairs, I\'m used to exchanging blades once every week or so.  Now I\'m exchanging them twice a week.  Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors\' products, and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to recommend.

I packaged up the entire original package as new, including the box, original receipt, and the cheesy complaint card you are entitled to write as per their refund guidelines. It cost me $12 to send all of this. Months later (seriously - like 2 1/2 months later!)they sent me back a letter & my receipt claiming that they cannot fulfill my request because I \'did not include the UPC code\'. The UPC code was on their packing!!! I sent it all back like new!!! More than they asked for!!!So - not only did I waste my time and an additional $12...but Gillette is wasting resources mailing this joke back to me...hence their costly product.I attribute this little event to Gilette not caring for my original review here on Amazon (below)...Hey America! Are why are we falling for this? Surely there are more of you who have noticed this disturbing trend of late?I am of Italian heritage with a heavy beard - I shave more whiskers in one stroke than most peach-fuzz Caucasians shave in a whole week...So if I don\'t need all these blades & tacky gimmicks - then no one does.All anyone requires is the original twin blade Sensor - loud, proud & simple. Easy to use with well-balanced quality. That was the Gillette I stuck with for many years. The Sensor was not impossibly wide/no annoying rubber fins/no vibrations/no batteries/no hype.This gimmicky, bulky, and overpriced nightmare fails to last any longer than a simple Sensor twin blade - here\'s why:The 5 blades here work well for the open expanse areas of the face...great. But they are way too wide to get at any tight spots like under your nose, upper lip, or any side-burn/mustache trimming. Gillette\'s solution is to flip over to a single trimming blade on the back. But here is where this entire concept fails: now we are down to the use & life of just this one blade!Get it?Once this one \'trimming\' blade is dull, the whole $3.00+ blade goes in the garbage!So really - it does not last any longer than a twin blade! With the old Sensor, we had the advantage of two blades hitting all the tight spots.And then there is this useless & goofy \'power\' business. So now, not only are we being forced to fork over $3.00+ per blade...but now we also have to start buying batteries. Gillette\'s stance on the environment? Well evidently their position is to now have millions more batteries going into our landfills. Lovely.And yes, Gillette is clearly bullying the marketplace as we longtime loyal customers can no longer find our favorites in the stores. And if we do - they are now priced double of what they were just a few short years ago. In fact, last time I found my Sensors at Walmart - there was a big sticker on the box asking the customer to call a 1-800 number to inform them if we \'see this product being sold elsewhere\'!! So much for competition and the free market economy!I remember everyone used to just go into the shaving aisle at the stores, grab their fave blades and leave. Now these aisles are full of price-shocked guys standing around scratching their heads, wondering what to do.OK, I understand that Gillette cannot effectively inventory all the retailers with every generation of product they ever made. I also believe in the evolution and optional availability of an evolved product. But give us the option of buying a simple twin blade at an affordable price and keep it readily available. But here Gillette has us over the barrel and is literally forcing everyone to pay a premium for what many of us do not believe is any better (in fact - annoyingly worse).If not, then I would say that this is an opportune time for the competition like Wilkinson Sword to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price. They would clean house. Unfortunately, I myself have not experimented much with the competition because of hit & miss availability. Don\'t want to find something one week - and then get stuck without the next. Hopefully that will now change.    "

(5000 is left-right, and Sonic is up-down). It really depends on where the dirt is hiding. I would say Sonic does a better job to clean the front teeth, and 5000 does a better to job to clean the teeth in the back.Power (5000):- 5000 wins. However, it may take 1 week for your body to adjust to the strong power.Timer (5000):- 5000 comes with a timer, which is very nice.Brush head design (Sonic):- We found that the brush of 5000 wears out much faster than Sonic. I guess it has something to do with the strong power of 5000.- One thing I hate about 5000 is the brush head design. There is a hole below the brush head, which capture the toothpaste when brushing. You cannot remove it without removing the brush head. If you leave the tooth brush standing, the toothpaste inside will get out, and eventually accumulate at the bottom of the brush. This creates a round mark in our sink. To solve this problem, we need to remove the brush head and clean it completely. We didn\'t have this problem with Sonic.Battery power (Sonic)- We don\'t charge the brush until the power is completely drained. Normally, the battery of Sonic lasts about 7 days, while 5000 lasts about 3-4 days. However, it takes about 18 hours to charge Sonic, while it takes less than 12 hours to charge 5000Other uses (Sonic)- We like to use the brush head to clean the tongue. Sonic wins.Overall, we like the Sonic better."

At first I didn\'t like the size (read: I wasn\'t used to it), but after brushing with it for a weeks, I realize that I like it better because I can be more precise with my brushing (like with a regular toothbrush)The charger has a small footprint, so it doesn\'t take up too much counter space. It is  also understated so it doesn\'t draw attention to itself.Cons:The attachments (brush, floss brush) can come off or loosen during brushing. If you brush in a wrist-twisting motion like me, you\'ll have to change your brushing style or the tops will keep coming off.It only comes with one brush head. This means that unless you\'re a bachelor, you\'ll need to buy additional heads. I haven\'t looked up the price to these, but that\'s definitely something to consider.There is no cover for the brush heads. This can\'t be too sanitary - especially in a bathroom (dust, hairspray, hand-washing splashes, toilet mist, etc)Final opinion:While I do think this could be a good-value alternative to the costlier sonic toothbrush models, ultimately it\'s hard to say if this unit cleans much better than a manual toothbrush. I still end up brushing my teeth like I did with a regular toothbrush  - the only difference being that this one is vibrating as I go.With questionable benefits and so many shortcomings, I cannot recomend this product."

Most dentists put the Oral B\'s at the top of the list, and I\'ve been very pleased with them, but this new one is a leap forward.All because of a simple improvement: it not only divides the mouth into quadrants and gives a little shake to prompt me to move from one quadrant to another, but it has a separate wireless display.  When the brush isn\'t in use, the display serves as a darned good digital clock, and when brushing, it converts into a timer and a map of the four quadrants, depicting which quadrants have been brushed.  Then, once the two minutes have passed, the round quadrant display turns into a smiling face, which grins if you\'ve really been brushing enough.And it\'s the darndest thing, but breaking it up into 4 quadrants not only shortens the perceived brushing time dramatically, but I for one--yes, it\'s embarrassing but true--actually want to \'please\' the display, and get that silly smiley face.  Worse than that, I want to get the big grin on the smiley face!No, I\'m not lonely, I have a lovely girlfriend who brushes right beside me, but we both find that these Oral B\'s turn the longest 2 minutes of the day into an all too short game that seems to last at most 30 seconds.  And the cavity-free dental exams are nice, too.The only negative point: as is the case with all previous Oral B electric toothbrushes I\'ve owned, after even a single brushing it seems to take impossibly long to completely recharge.  I don\'t have any other rechargeable appliance that comes close.  It\'s not much of a problem, but it does seem peculiar."

The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  The brush itself is cordless, although the cord on the base station would be better served if it were retractable, for space management purposes.  Oral-B claims that the rechargeable battery cannot be \'killed\' by repeated charging, so hopefully that works as advertised.  The package also comes with one replacement head, which is a value-added touch.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.Second, effectiveness.  It\'s equipped with a 2 minute timer, which indicates the suggested total brushing length.  This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner after usage, although not quite on par with visiting a dentist\'s office.  The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.The review merits the deduction of one star, due to head design.

Maybe it\'s the vibration, maybe it IS the thinner blades, but whatever it is, it works.My beard is very coarse and grows like a caveman.  I can be completely smooth in the morning and by 7:00 at night, my face feels like sandpaper.  Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  The ProGlide is like butter.  Easily lumberjacking the thousands of mini pine trees that decorate my face.  This is my first experience with a \'powered\' razor.  I\'ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  Perhaps this is the reason the ProGlide feels to smooth.  Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  My face stays smooth ALL DAY.  I do have to shave the next morning, but if I wanted to, I could go into work (like I did today) with a minor sandpaper face.

A crest representative came to my office, presented information that made sense and had literature that this brush was the only toothbrush to show increased efficacy in independent testing.  Anyway I bought several for my parents and myself and have been impressed.What I like:-Makes your teeth \'feel\' noticeably cleaner, like they feel when they\'ve just been cleaned at the dental office-Wireless display motivates me to brush longer than I normally would, I\'ll be honest I don\'t know where they got the recommended 2 minute timeframe, but I do it to see the smiley face on the indicator-Wireless display has PRESSURE INDICATOR; I diagnose wear on teeth at the gum line multiple times everyday.  If this is an issue for you get this brush.  It\'ll save you money at the dentist and stop you from harming your teeth-Well made, handle is thin and ergonomic, charger has a small footprint on the counter, no electrical components exposed and everything feels sturdy-Wide selection of brush heads that are reasonably priced ($40 for a 2 year supply at Costco).  Two heads stand out to me.  The first is the funky looking one, which actually provides a floss like action between teeth.  NOT a substitute for flossing but I have noticed considerably less debris removed when I do floss after using this brush.  Also there is an orthodontic (braces) brush that gets in-between the teeth and the braces.  If you are plunking down the thousands for your child to have braces get this brush / attachment, otherwise when the braces a removed there is a good chance the teeth will have unsightly white halos around where the brackets were which is actually decalcification which is the start of cavities.Overall I\'m very impressed with this brush so it is most defiantly \'dentist recommended\' by myself.

Well Venuse Embrace were on sale so I decided to splurge and get it. The rubber handle is great and you can easily hold your grip on the razor. The moisturizing strips are awesome and really make it glide smoothly. You almost don\'t even need the soap (but I still do soap up). If I miss a spot, I can just go right over it without re-soaping leg. I have sensitive skin, so I was worried the five blades would irritate me but its been great, no irritation. Also these blades are lasting a long time. I\'m onto my 5th shave (both legs(thigh & calf) and underarms)and I\'m still getting a great super close shave.  These are definitely pricey, but as a splurge I\'d get them again and recommend to others. Also the little shower caddy does actually work. I was just going to throw the thing out but decided to try it. I figured I would toss it if it fell off. So far its been good and staying place. This is a nice bonus since I can keep the razor out of the reach of my 2 year old daughter. I did keep it on a ledge but it was always knocked down. This was a perk I didn\'t anticipate, so it made me feel a little better about the price LOL.    "

NOTE: the annoying part about the smartguide is taking off that darn battery cover! other reviewers weren\'t exaggerating about that at all! the clock on mine is still an hr behind since i couldn\'t remove that stupid battery cover to adjust the time.i\'ve only used two brush heads so far, whitening and floss-action. i\'m not sure if the whitening head really whitens like a whitening strip, but at least mine aren\'t staining even without using whitening toothpaste. the floss-action one doesn\'t really \'floss\' well. when you start off, it might be a good idea to use the sensitive or whitening head since the bristles are softer and more gentle on your gums until you\'re used to the \'power\' of an electric toothbrush.overall, i do love the toothbrush and even bought a couple additional ones for my family as gifts. so, i definitely recommend it."

I absolutely think that they are the best razors. You buy a handle that comes with razor cartridges and a holder for the shower and then just buy additional razor cartridges as needed. One cartridge will last me for months, much different and eventually much cheaper than the cheapest disposable razors which only last about a week or so.Gillette\'s new Venus Spa Breeze Razor combines the great Venus razor blades and handle with new shave gel bars that eliminate the need for separate shaving cream.I wasn\'t sure at first about how well the shave gel bars would work but after trying, I\'m hooked. This changes shaving for me from now on. It\'s aggravating to have to use shaving cream and with the Venus Spa Breeze, you don\'t need it.Perfect for shaving in the shower, just wet the razor and glide the razor over your legs. A smooth shave with no irritation. Afterwards, my legs were incredibly smooth and soft. Just be careful over smaller areas like underarms to be sure you have plenty of water to avoid irritation. It seemed the longer that I used the razor like over the long stretches of leg, the shave gel bars seem to really work the best. The razor doesn\'t produce foam or cream like actual shaving cream but just a slick moisturizer, that\'s why it works best with plenty of water.*Note* If you are currently a regular Venus razor user, the cartridges for the Venus Spa Breeze fit the blue Venus handle also so you could just purchase the Spa Breeze cartridges to use with your current handle.Highly recommend.

Very affordable; it has  a 2 min time built in; a set of 2 AA alkaline batteries last close to 2 months without the loss of speed (some technology built-in do that), but make sure you grease  battery cap o-ring before you close or it will crack after some time (it happened  to me); it lasts  forever  and it does the  same  job as  the  much more expensive Oral-B in the market. Dito.I have posted the same review for the oral-b vitality toothbrush, but it is related to the pro-health model as well.I\'ve been brushing my teeth wih oral-b for over 10 years now, and they are all similar to  the vitality model.  I\'ve  always used the least expensive model since I see no difference from the expensive ones, unless you are looking for \'extras\', like timer, lcd screen, etc. The vitality is a very good brush. I use the round head instead of the elongated.  I rather brush my teeth with oral-b than any other eletric brush on the market. The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well. Oral-B  entry level eletric brushes are the way to  go. I can\'t brush my teeth with regular toothbrush anymore. Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but saty way from the  cheap kind. They are knock-offs  and last less  than a month. The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more. The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings. I think this is annoying. I didn\'t want to leave the brush recharging after every use. So I bought the ORAL-B Pro-Health that uses two AA batteries. It is simply AMAZING. The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better. The batteries lasts forever on the pro-health. I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months. It is the best.  The vitality rechargeable brush gets very slow after 3-4 days. Not with the pro-health. Buy the  pro-health. It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design. Another thing is ORAL-B equipment lasts forever. I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me. And since they are the entry level brushes, I just buy another one of  the same. No need to buy another battery.Again, go with the ORAL-B PRO-HEALTH eletric toothbrush."

But by keeping the brush on its stand with the charging cord plugged in I should have maximum power for each brushing.  The instructions that come with the brush say you can leave it plugged in, but recommend that every 6 months you let the battery deplete itself.Like another reviewer, I have sensitive teeth and prefer a soft brush.  The brush head that came with the brush seemed to work just fine for me.  The test will be when I have my next visit to the dentist and learn whether there has been an increase in gum erosion since the last visit.  However, just based on short time use, I have no reason to think there will be a problem.  My brushing includes running the brush over my tongue and the bristles feel no different than my other brushThe brush heads that I used on the previous brush don\'t work on this, but the literature that comes with the brush describes 5 different heads that do.  Quite an interesting variety, including floss action, precision clean, white+clean, and sensitive clean.As is true of most electric toothbrushes, heads are pricey if purchased from a local stored.  Amazon sells them at a heavily discounted price, so it is a good place to buy head replacements.  What I do and recommend that others do is to buy a supply of brushes at a time in order to get the best price and insure you have enough on hand to replace a head every 3 months if used twice a day.  The per head price is cheaper if you buy a pack of 6 heads than if you buy the standard 3 pack.  Amazon has both."

As is turned out, the ProGlide is better and noticeably so.  There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face.  It also seems like I\'m been getting a closer shave.  The best part of the ProGlide is that your can use your old Fusion handles to attach the blades onto.  No need to buy special ProGlide handles.  The only bad part that I have noticed so far is that the ProGlide seems to wear down much faster than the old Fusion.  I have to replace the ProGlide blades about a week earlier than I used to with the old Fusion.    "

It\'s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.  To the couple of reviewers that say they couldn\'t tell the difference, I\'d say you\'re either shaving wrong or do not have sensitive skin.  With the Fusion Power, I\'d pretty much have to shave in the shower to avoid razor burn on my neck.  With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving -- no razor burn at all (or ingrown hairs), even shaving against the grain on my neck.Here\'s what a lot of the reviewers are missing. On the Fusion Power, I had to change blades every 7-10 days. Any more than that and I\'d get torn up. I\'m in my TENTH week of using the Power Proglide blades, and I\'m on my THIRD BLADE!!! It\'s JUST about time to change, but I could still probably handle another shave or two with no less comfort than I had with the regular Fusion Power blades. 3 BLADES in 67 days!!  And the other cool thing is that these blades work perfectly on the Fusion Power chassis, so no need to buy the new Power Proglide razor (unless you just want to upgrade for the looks).So yes, individually, the blades ARE more expensive than any other blade. But the cost savings, even over just a year, will be SIGNIFICANT for me -- almost $60/year vs. the Fusion Power... AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHAVE EVER??? It\'s a no brainer!!Update:  Still LOVING this shaver almost a year later.  I did determine that what you\'re using for shaving cream makes a BIG difference.  I\'ve used Neutrogena for Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream for years, but decided to try an organic one from Kiss Your Face.  Lots of razor burn and discomfort with that cream, even with a brand new blade (tried it for two days).  So, back to the Neutrogena and couldn\'t be happeier with the Fusion Power ProGlide.    "

It was so light.  I ran my hand down the length of my leg and it was soooo smooth!  The contour pivoting head was so awesome as well.  I have knobby type knees and this thing just glided over them like it was skiing the Alps.  Then I gave it the ultimate challenge.  I hadn\'t tended to the bikini area for awhile so I gave that a go.  This razor just took care of all the business there like it was baby fine hair (which it was NOT).I like the fact that it comes with a suction cup razor holder but be sure to place this strategically in your shower or bathtub so no water runs directly on it because it will lose suction and you don\'t want to have water pouring over the Olay moisture bars.  I have used this razor for at least two weeks now (a total of 8 times) and the moisture bar does not look to have dwindled in size at all.  The blades (5 of them!) still seem ultra sharp.I definitely recommend this razor and honestly...I might toss the Mach one in the trash and use this baby full time.  The ONLY downside is that the moisture bar contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate and anyone who follows my reviews knows how I feel about that ingredient.  So, I am giving this product 4 stars only because of the SLS content.    "

It does and the \'special lubricating strip\' wears out sooner.  Frequent razor replacement in addition to the cost of a better quality shave cream is ridiculously expensive.

I\'ve tried alternative blades, including old-fashioned double edge blades, and although I resist buying and using the Mach3 because IMO the cartridges are way overpriced (one source says the cartridges cost 9 cents to produce, yet they typically retail for around $2.30 per cartridge), I always return to the Mach3 because it gives me the cleanest, most consistently bloodless shave.I\'m looking now at the Mach3 I bought back when they were introduced side by side with a Mach3 disposable, and if there is any difference between the actual shaving heads, I cannot detect it. I don\'t know if handles that hold Mach3 cartridges are made the same as they were when I bought mine, but my old one has some metal on it and is heavier than the disposable, which is all plastic and rubber. The handle of the disposable is fatter than that on my old Mach3, making for a somewhat more comfortable grip.I bought this 6-pack of disposables because with Amazon\'s present special offer (a $2 e-coupon that is applied at checkout) the price per unit is only around $1.80 each (compared, as I say above, to an average price of around $2.30 per cartridge). When I use these up I\'ll look for the best price I can find on Mach3 cartridges or disposables and will purchase whichever is cheapest.These disposables have clear covers over the blades, which slide off and can easily be slid back on, making them especially handy for travel.A few years ago, after shaving for around four decades with various shaving foams, I discovered Aveeno shave gel and have used it ever since. A little bit goes a very long way so I don\'t worry about the price, and I find the Aveeno gel/Mach3 blade combination perfect for my face and fairly dense and tough beard.    "

Try DE Shaving!!","I\'ve used each new version of the Gillette series since I started shaving.  (my first razor was the Gillette Sensor)I do believe this gives me the best shave from Gillette since I started using their cartridge razors.  The problem is that with each new razor comes a price increase.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor cartridges sells for $3.50-$4.00 per cartridge...Ouch!!  Thinking for years that buying the 4 and 8 pack refills was a rip-off, I looked into DE shaving.  I bought an old Gillette Super Speed safety razor and a sample pack Double Edge razor blades and started learning the proper way to shave.  A little math now...at $3.50/cartridge for Gillette Fusion I will spend $182.00/year for razors.  I can\'t use them for more than a week.  In fact the proglide razor seems to lose performance after the 3rd shave for me, but I push it to 6 shaves.  I can buy a 100 pack of Astra DE razor blades for $15.75.  That\'s (rounded up) $.16/razor.  I can use them for 1 week also, so I spend $8.32/year for DE razors.  After a couple month of learning to shave with a DE razor I\'m now getting the same (if not better) results than I get with the Fusion Pro Glide.  The only advantage that the Fusion ProGlide has over old school DE razors is that it is a little quicker, but $173.68 per year in savings is enough to get me off the cartridge razor bandwagon, and into the Double Edge Razor bandwagon.

A few months ago I went out to buy replacements and found that a wall of four bladed monsters had replaced my old two-fer. I decided to try the one that looked the least intimidated. When I got it home I quickly found it to be misery on a stick as it snagged my skin and pulled out any surrounding longer hairs by the roots. It was also too wide for sensitive areas.When Amazon offered this one I was a bit skeptical at first but decided to try something made specifically for a woman. I\'m glad I did. This three bladed shaver glides easily, works well over sharp angles and with its built in shaving soap is the perfect touch up razor before a quick run to the pool.I mounted the included razor case (using the material provided) to the left of the shower head and keep it there in its holder. So far I\'ve managed four shaves off of one blade and I anticipate more.  The blades come in sealed containers so you don\'t have to worry about the unused ones becoming soggy in the case.The gel soap bars that frame each side of the head are holding up well and also serve to keep the razor from \'digging\' and \'snagging\' like my earlier purchase. I have very sensitive skin and the pleasantly scented gel does not irritate me. I\'ve found my new razor!    "

I have a heavy beard and sensitive skin, so I am always on the lookout for a better shaver. I have tried several electrics [Norelco & Braun] and of course they are no match for a blade. I have tried the Schick multi blade shavers and the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power with the vibrating handle is better. The blades really do seem to glide over my skin, and if I re-shave against the grain, I get the closest shave I have ever had. This is an improvement over the older Gillette Fusion.  I also recommend using the Gillete Fusion Thermal Face Scrub just prior to shaving. It heats up the skin and seems to thicken and raise the beard hairs so the shave is even closer.    "

It is by far the best cartridge system on the market.  The slim head is much more manageable than the oversized wall of blades of the Mach 3 (which feels like you are just wiping your face with blades, instead of using a razor).

I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  I floss daily and have used a Sonicare electric brush for close to 15 years.  It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  That was a bit much for me.  And my teeth weren\'t that bad, it\'s just that he was very fastidious.  I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  And I ALWAYS swish my mouth out with water after eating or drinking anything.Anyway, when I got the chance to try this Oral-b, of course I was up for the challenge.  When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the other.After trying the Oral-b for a week, I can tell you that I am definitely a Sonicare person.  Here is the breakdown of my experience:Oral-b pros:*Handle feels nice in hand.  It has a silicone/rubbery grip that is ergononimic*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.Oral-b cons:*Way too noisy.  I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  Not a relaxing experience, I felt too stressed with all of the noise, lights, and buzzing.*The depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush head.*It does not stop after 2 minutes of brushing.  I am used to the way the Sonicare handle stops working after you\'ve hit the 2 minute mark.  With the Sonicare if I want to keep brushing after the 2 minutes, I just press the button again.  With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn\'t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  Next bullet point.*Loud humming with surge pulse.  This is Oral-b\'s answer to Sonicare\'s quadrant pacer, where it nudges you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn\'t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!*Single button control. It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.*Cleanliness?  I didn\'t feel like my teeth were any cleaner than they already were when I used my Sonicare.I still believe that liking the Oral-b or Sonicare is a matter of personal preference.  Cost analysis-wise, the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  But I prefer the Sonicare."

I will never go back to normal manual brushes and can\'t believe I hadn\'t bought this earlier!  My teeth honestly look and feel healthier than ever and like they all say, it does feel like i just stepped out of the dentist\'s office.  Buy it, it\'ll save you wonders on dental bills and all but ensure you won\'t have teeth problems, gingivitis, etc.  I use the \'sensitive\' mode to brush my tongue as well, and the \'massage\' mode helps strengthen your gums and feels good too.  The extra brush head that\'s included is awesome, and the display helps you see how long you\'ve been brushing, what mode you\'re on, and also functions as an extra bathroom clock :)All in all, very satisfied with this purchase.

Admittedly, not the best practice, but its habit now for 20+ years and I\'m not changing.This is an excellent razor.  Shaves quick and clean, even \'against the grain\' on the sensitive areas like my upper lip.  No razor burn, not irritation.  The vibrating action of the blade really seems to help over the standard versions.  The non-vibrating blades, even the nicer ones, always leave razor burn if I shave against the grain, so I am forced to go with the grain even though it does not seem to be as close of a shave.  This blade allows me to shave the way I want to, without the irritation I get with other blades.Even has a cool blue light on the power button that lights up when its turned on, not sure what good its for as the razor vibrates so its hard to forget that its on, but its neat anyway.Blade refills are rather expensive, but that seems to be a fact of life now on all razors unless you choose to go with the one piece, single use type.I have used the same blade daily for about 2 weeks now, and it just started getting uncomfortable.  I can live with that.  For anyone who used shave gel or foam, you could probably go a bit longer.I can unconditionally recommend this blade.  After all, you probably shave every day, why not use something that is comfortable and fast?    "

It gets into tight areas and along the gum line if you need it to.The Bad: There are problems with this product though. Even on the \'sensitive\' setting, the brushing can be a bit harsh. If it didn\'t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it\'s not. I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation. This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing. Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes. Yes, this one is supposed to beep, but my didn\'t always do that.The Ugly: Then there\'s the deal breaker - the handle is so small and it vibrates so intensely in my hand that it is painful to use on a daily basis.

All types of mach 3\'s produce an equal shave which is at the same time, close and the blades clean out well under a hot tap. but the overriding factor that made me come back to them was the 7 variaties of handle to choose from, so now i can have a different razor for every day of the week which overall makes shaving everyday more tolerable. i dont personally believe in the micro-pulses of the m3 power but the vibrations themselves must enhance the the performance somehow. if your thinking of buying one of the mach 3\'s then go for it, as you won\'t be dissapointed.

It produces a STRONG vibration...VERY strong.  Not for the young child or the sensitive mouth.  I seriously felt like I\'d put a power drill into my mouth!That being said, I\'d have to say it is worth the uncomfortable feeling (which I\'m starting to get used to) -- even after just the first use, my teeth looked shiny and polished, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  And despite the strong vibration, I didn\'t have any issues with my gums bleeding.  I think it just takes some getting used to, especially if, like me, you\'re not used to using a power toothbrush.So I would say that the only downside is that you can\'t control the level of vibration -- it\'s either on or off.  Sometimes it would be nice to turn it down a bit (especially in the morning...though I guess it\'s an effective way to wake up!).  ;-)  Adjustable power levels would make this a 5-star product.

But is it sigificantly better than the original fusion? This is what I\'ve found. I shave in the shower, warm water, using a unscented Gillette shaving gel. The handle of the proglide has a slightly different shape, more of a knob at the end. I suppose the knobv makes it easier to grasp the end of the razor when making gentle swipes alog the skin, sort of an artist at work. But the handle of the original fusion is also okay, and I don\'t think the new handle is much of an improvement, if any. The blades in  the cartridge are great, more than marginally better than the original. A few easy swipes do the job for most of the face. I\'ve found the razor shaves closer than the original about the neck and above the upper lip. Result is the shave time is quicker with a good result. I also believe a proglide cartridge will last longer than the fusion. I\'ve used one cartridge for about twenty shaves, and so far it is doing the job. thus, since the cartridge seems to give more shaves, that fact ought to offset the extra cost. Bottom line is, the new proglide fusion is great, better than the original, but since the original fusion cartridges also do a great jobb, I plan to use them up before switching over to the proglide.Update april 2011 - I think the proglide works best for men who shave every day, and against the grain for a close shave. The blades are thin and close and work best with short hairs. When shaving with two or more days of growth, hthen it\'s best to first shave downward, with the grain, and then up against the grain to get a close shave.    "

They do come loose and fall off in my mouth, there is not the same vibrating motion, they are a little rough. Also, I closely compared an off brand one to an Oral-B and found that there are less bristles on the cheaper one. The bristles are in little groups: Oral B=26, offbrand=18. So, you get what you pay for, I am afraid. Still, Oral B could be kinder and charge less for these simple little things, we know it costs very little to make them.

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  This particular item is three heads.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads.  You can find them for much less than $10/head, which is the price of this listing."

Once I got over feeling like I was brushing my teeth with a swirling brillo pad (a sonic toothbrush head doesn\'t rotate, it just kinda vibrates). I discovered what I have been missing! I brush too hard. There is a light on the back of the toothbrush (so you can see it in a mirror) that comes on when you apply too much pressure. The next thing I discovered was how clean my teeth felt! The Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing plaque between teeth (better than a sonic brush).

On the plus side it really hugs your face, shaves cleanly with a single pass, and doesn\'t nick or abrade the skin. Even the edges under the jaw line came clean. I hate shaving and often skip weekends yet find that it works quite well on one, two, or even three day\'s worth of growth. Haven\'t gone longer than that so I couldn\'t say for sure but seems like it\'d do okay for another day or two. Any longer and it would take a pass with an electric trimmer to shorten things up first. The handle is nicely ergonomic too, easy to grip and control when wet. On the minus side the single trim blade doesn\'t work horribly well, at least not for me. I\'ve got to even up my sideburns and trim around my goatee and this just doesn\'t do the trick. Considering what they cost, the blades don\'t last as long as I\'d like either. I\'ve used it regularly for about three weeks and it\'s just starting to dull enough to consider changing the blade. Might be able to stretch it another week but that might be pushing it. Considering that I can go a year with an electric model (Braun) on a single blade/screen set I\'d think they could make a manual that lasts more than a month...Despite the downside, it\'s the best manual razor I\'ve used so far. Quick, clean, comfortable shave... Got one as a free promotion and liked it enough to pick up a pack of refill cartridges. They are a bit pricey but not overmuch.

I get just as good a shave with a Bic disposable single blade so five blades really isn\'t better. Hell, THREE blades is unecessary (and two can be downright painful). I have purchased a Mercur safety razor which I think will hold me over for a good forty years as it is a tried and true antiquity, is a single blade, and the said blades cost like a buck for ten at Longs (standard double edge). Horrendous value cartridge-wise and not really a terribly good shave to boot. I really should probably have given it a one star, but hey, it works.

The \'power\' option with battery and all sounds great, but doesn\'t work at all.  It\'s a placebo and an expensive one at that.I\'m going back to using Mach3.Here\'s a tip that has really served me well:  use hair conditioner rather than shaving foam, and you will get a much closer shave.  At first, I didn\'t believe a friend of mine when he gave me this tip.  But it\'s true.  I get much closer shaves.  And the other great benefit is that your razor blades last much, much longer.  Instead of a razor blade lasting me for a couple of weeks, tops, when I use foam, my blade is good for six to eight weeks when I use hair conditioner. Needlessly to say, now I only use hair conditioner for shaves.  And I don\'t have to tell you, this translates to not only getting great shaves, but to saving a lot of money!    "

I like it a lot as I feel my teeth are cleaner and fresher when I am done.  I like the dual action brush as it cleans a larger tooth surface and massages your gums.  This toothbrush removes more plaque than a regular toothbrush and does a better job of polishing your teeth.  My dentist recommends Oral B and so I tried one and use it daily.I have changed the brushing head many times and the base even uses the rotating single action head if you can\'t find the dual action one.  The toothbrush has charged for over 3 years with the inductive charging stand and the batteries are still good.  I am happy with the quality of the product and the way it cleans my teeth.  I recommend it to you as a good product.

I also like that I\'m able to reach back and even brush my wisdom teeth and get them clean.  Something I couldn\'t do with a manual toothbrush.  Since this is my first electric toothbrush I had to learn to adjust also to the fact that I don\'t have to press down hard and push like with a manual toothbrush.  This one really does the work for you.  And I have found it best to let it linger some on each tooth.  And the results are that my teeth really do look and feel clean.  I\'m quite pleased with this gadget and I do very much recommend it.  It comes with a replacement toothbrush head as well, however, you have to figure out a way to store it on your own.

Usually, I buy the regular, round Flexisoft brush heads. The last time I tried to purchase them, however, the store was out of stock. But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.They work well. They deliver that nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and expect from our Oral-B\'s. In this regard, they are at least the equivalent of the Flexisofts, and they may even be slightly superior.Braun embeds 4 little rubber \'paddles\' into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss. I can not detect any \'flossing\' from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess. It may be that the \'paddles\' do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell. They cause no discomfort. The brushing feels slightly different, but not unpleasant.The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers. Rather than being circular, like the regular heads, it is an oval. The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large. I think that one of the Oral-B\'s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth. That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.When I need to replace these, I will look for the regular Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. In my opinion, those are the best. But if I can\'t find them, I would not hesitate to buy these again.***UPDATE 2/2011: It amazes me, but there appears to be a *thriving* market in counterfeit Oral-B Brush Heads! I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon. Under the price, where it says \'Sold By\' make sure that it says \'Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\' If it doesn\'t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \'More Buying Choices,\' and see if you can find one that says Amazon. Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don\'t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon."

It\'s almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money. While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year."

Amazon rocks as usual. I noticed that replacement heads are a little expensive but really worth it (make sure they\'re from a reputable seller due to fakes on the market).

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.    "

Back then I was using Hydro and was satisfied and not willing to change. Then proglide comes out and that same friend described how proglide crushed the fusion in terms of the best shaving experience he ever had. By then I had already made my mind up to give proglide a try based on a thinner blade. As you will see here the overwhelming majority of people including me find this the best shave ever. What I find is I feel like its not shaving it is so easy to use and the results are a smooth shave no bumps or irration. Yes, very expensive and when I tried to go back to hydro I longed for proglide so here I am very satisfied albeit the price is high but my hopes are the price will drop a bit. I wish hydro would come up with a thinner blade because it really does matter. Everyones shaving experience is different but I am able to use the blade a minimum of 5 times before the blade degrades. I did find it challenging to shave moustache area but with time it has gotten better. I do shave my head as well with great ease too. Proglide really changed the shaving game. Highly recommend!    "

What\'s different?  5 blades!I\'ve used most of the Venus products, thinking (erroneously) that I was leaving less plastic in a landfill by buying a razor with replaceable blades.  The first Venus promised \'the legs of a Goddess\'.  That one had 2 blades.  Somewhere along the line, they\'ve gone to 3, and now 5 blades.  There was even one that took a battery and vibrated a little bit!  But I digress.Out of the box:  a razor, an extra blade package, a suction cup mount for the shower wall.They were truthful, this razor will give you a close smooth shave.  The pivoting head keeps you from cutting yourself, and yes, this works well.  The \'moisture strip\' ensures a smooth glide up your leg.  Its quick, feels nice in your hand, and I got smooth, goddess-like legs without a lot of effort, and without having to stem any bleeding.  5 stars for shaving efficacy.I like the moisture strip because it allows the razor to glide smoothly up your leg without \'skipping\' or scraping.  It seems silly and maybe even gimmicky, but compared to a razor without one, the moisture strip is amazingly helpful.The little plastic gadget is meant to suction cup to the shower wall.  It opens like a little door to reveal a spare blade set.  Nice idea, but it wouldn\'t stick to my shower.  And when it falls off it blows itself to smithereens.  Earlier versions had double stick tape, and the suction cup idea is far preferable, if only it worked.Compared to disposable razors, this is far superior.  It works better, and you don\'t cut yourself.  Compared to other Venus razors, not much difference.  I like them all!  I\'m not convinced that 5 blades are necessary (unless you are a yeti) but all things being equal why not?All in all, highly recommended, watch for a sale.    "

The trimmer works well and didn\'t pull any hairs on my beard and the fusion razor is well... a fusion razor. We\'ll see how it stands the test of time. Finally a trimmer that won\'t sit on the shelf. Well worth the price.

Not only is it the cheapest razor from the Gilette Venus line,  but it also leaves my legs silky smooth. In order to achieve the most silkiest feeling legs i rub body butter on my legs after the shave/shower.The razor itself is great. It is really hard to  cut yourself, unless you go up or down with the razor sideways-- this will result in a clean cut, but it will be deep and will bleed.  Leaving the razor in the shower/bath will make it rust/dull faster due to the moisture so make sure to wipe off the razor after your shower and store it away (even if it is in a drawer) it will prolong the cartridges life. Also when it dulls it will leave your legs not that smooth and with little stubble -- so don\'t forge to change those cartridges.This box does not come with a razor, it is just the cartridges and each cartridge is individually packed. It is simple to replace the cartridges on the razor, just pop off the old cartridge, open the new cartridge packet, and pop the razor into the new cartridge. Done.    "

Otherwise, it\'s the same razor.For those who have not used a Venus razor:There are three main features of a Venus razor versus a standard multi-blade women\'s razor.The first is the soap/gel bars.  These bars basically provide the glide that you usually get from shave gel or foam.  You can definitely shave without lathering up.  That saves you time and cost.  However, the bars do mean that you have to press a little harder than you might be used to when the razor head is new to get a close shave.  (As the bars wear down from use, you don\'t have to press as hard.)  Until you get used to this, you may notice some unintended stubble.  Also, the bars make it a little tough to clean the razor.  I\'ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I\'m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  It\'d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  I really liked the scent on this one, and I\'m not normally a fan of shave gel scents.The second big feature of the Venus line is the easy-to-change razor head.  When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  Then, you open a sealed replacement head and click the handle into the slot.  It\'s a much safer and easier replacement process than razors I\'ve owned in the past.  Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it\'s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  Each razor head is individually packaged, so it\'s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  You don\'t have to worry about cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.The third feature is the hanging rack.  The Venus razor kit comes with a mounting rack for your shower.  The rack sticks to the shower wall using adhesive pads, and it holds 4 replacement blades (not included) and the razor with a blade attached.  I\'ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  Gillette didn\'t improve on this design for the Spa Breeze line.  I was hoping they\'d offer a suction-cup design.  Also, the design is such that you can\'t really use it unless you wall mount it.  The razor needs gravity to stay in place, and because the bottom of the rack is rounded, you can\'t just set it vertically on a shelf.  I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.As for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  I have very fine hair.  Many razors just aren\'t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I\'ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)All in all, the Venus line is excellent.  I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  I\'d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.    "

It\'s lasted an amazingly long time; the battery has just recently started having trouble keeping a charge. (Mechanically, it still works perfectly.) So, I decided to try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush.Compared to the Sonicare, the Oral-b is quite different. It\'s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \'sonic\' movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts. The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \'floss action\' rubber points work quite differently as well. At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth. Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice. I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.(One small issue wroth noting: all the included tooth brush heads look the same. It\'s awkward to share between two people because the different heads look identical. It would be nice to have different colored heads, like Philips provides.)"

I decided to give this Gillette a shot, and needless to say, was a little disappointed.Does it keep my drier?  Well, when used correctly (apply at night, which was hard to get used to) and not washing underneath my arms in the shower in the morning, it worked slightly better than what I\'m used to.  The problem is, however, that it\'s not realistic.  Sure, I can get used to applying deodorant on at night.  But can I get used to NOT scrubbing underneath my arms during my morning shower?  Ummm...no.I tried the unscented kind, which was fine - literally no scent.  I experienced no irritation or any other kind of side effect from it.I ended up being slightly drier, but still sweaty using the Gillette.  I\'m sure everyone is different, and maybe I\'m a profuse sweater, but it just didn\'t work enough for me to justify the premium (costs over twice what I normally get for marginal results).It might be worth a shot if you\'re desperately looking for a solution to underarm perspiration.  It\'s certainly a cheaper alternative than paying for $700 Botox injections every 6 months.  But don\'t expect this to be the answer to your prayers.  At least for me, it certainly wasn\'t.    "

Let\'s make the thing vibrate too.. that\'ll really blow their minds.Marketing Guy #1: This also buys us some time for when we decide to release the 8 blade razor.  Helloooo promotion!This thing is a gimmick.  It works just as well at any 3-blade razor I\'ve tried.  In fact, packing 5 blades into such a small space requires you to constantly rinse the razor, making for even longer shaving sessions.  Depending on your skin, you will be more susceptible to razor burn with this razor as well.Overall, this thing doesn\'t do anything better than a 3-blade razor.

I\'ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  My gums also feel massaged by the vibratory scrubbing they receive, hence that just-went-to-the-dentist feeling without the paperwork, wait, or cost."

And that makes all the difference.,"I have tried so many razors in my year of shaving, and I think I have found the right one. When I first started shaving, about a year ago ( I\'m kinda new to this), I used my moms pink plastic cheapo gillettes that come in packs of like ten. These sucked! Everytime I shaved I would get a new Nick or cut. They didn\'t get all the hair, having only two blades, and irritated my skin. Next, my stepmom bought a pack of cvs brand rip offs of the bic soleil. I thought I was in heaven. These didn\'t Nick quite as much, and had a grippier handle, so there were no slips. I honestly liked this razor, at least compared to those two bladed ones. Then my sister decided to buy herself a Venus spa breeze. I admit to trying it once of twice. This was an even better shave than the cvs ones. The only problem I had where those big shave gel bars. They were slimy and left residue on my legs. I still liked the shave though, but didn\'t want to spend money at the time on sething I wasn\'t completly satisfied with, so I went back to the cvs ones. Finally after hearing my friend raving about the Venus embrace, I thought I\'d try it out. It wasn\'t that expensive, and if I didn\'t like it, I just wodn\'t buy refills. So I bought it. I was in love.The 5 blades cut a little bit closer than the cvs brand \' soleil\'. I didn\'t miss any hairs, even though I only took one pass on each section. I even got a close shave on my knees, thanks to the pivoting head. I also found that my shave took a lot les time. I was done in about half the time it usually took me. I didn\'t even get any cuts.The ribbon of moisture works great. My legs are less irritated than before and it really gave a smooth shave.The soft grip handle was a comfortable fit in my palm. I wouldn\'t say it was grippier than the cvs, but it was certainly a step up from the gillettes.The only thingni felt was not nesasary was the shower pod. Idont keep my razor in the shower anyways, because my younger sis has a tendancy to steal and use my razor. With a razor like this I knew she would want to try it out. The razor is tucked away safely in my room, with the pod in my junk drawer.I give this razor five stars. I am definitly buying the refills.    "

The two-minute timer is especially helpful for everyone, as Son knows when he\'s done and I can listen for the toothbrush to signal rather than digging up yet another destroyed kitchen timer.

The difference was immediate. My first visit to the hygienist after two months use astounded her. She told me she had allowed an hour for my cleaning as the calculus buildup on my teeth had been graded C on my visit 6 months previously. She said it was now an A, and was finished in 20 minutes(No discount). She was impressed that the only difference was an Oral B electric with the floss brush-head. As for the 5000 the difference is noticeable. Much longer battery life. Where the 3D was good for 3 minutes and then needed an hour charge. The 5000 will go at least 5 minutes with full power. Probably more. I got bored and ended my experiment after 5 minutes. I also like the fact it is only high speed with a 30 second pulse. I never saw the need for a slower speed option. The 5000 also has an open charging stand, eliminating the gunk buildup the 3D was prone to, and taking less counter space. As for the clock, I have no idea what it\'s for. Set up is simple. Just plug in the charger and set the brush on. The display will let you know when you\'re ready to go. And best of all you can\'t screw it up.

The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  There are no recesses to collect toothpaste, moisture etc., so it is easy to keep clean.  I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...my whole mouth.  It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone. I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \'between\' brush would be a good thing to use. The only change I would make would be to slant the head a bit to enable reaching inside surfaces.  All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...in fact it is still working. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the Sonicare, but for the money, this is the best buy. After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  AND, I do not work for Oral B.  Come on...get real paranoid people...09/10/09:  I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  I have not had this problem.  I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed and I can see where that might create the above mentioned problem.  I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  Just food for thought if trying to decide on this product.  I still love it."

Two minutes go by in a flash and my teeth feel clean, even cleaner than some cleanings I have had in the dentist\'s office.The timer was very difficult to open.  There are two pieces of plastic covering the battery. Instead of sliding the top cover one has to press and raise it off the appliance.  (If this sounds confusing, it is.)  The second cover slides off.All things considered, I think I will be very happy with this toothbrush.

I need a deodorant that will go on dry and comfortable, but one that will also go on clear, and not stain darker clothing.With their Clear Shield line, Gillette does just that.To put it simply, Gillette\'s product gets the job done. It goes on dry and clear, and gives long-lasting odor protection that lasts all day. I put this on every morning before work, and several hours later when I get home, it\'s still working for me.If there\'s one negative (and from what I can tell, other reviewers will back me up on this), it\'s that the scent is a bit too \'sweet.\' It\'s almost as if Gillette was trying to create a product men and women alike could comfortably use - and in that aspect, the end result is questionable. They really need to get more scents out, and specific ones for men and women, not one that\'s just a compromise.Negatives considered, this is still a top-notch product. It goes on dry and clear and gives long-lasting odor protection. It\'s still more than good enough to earn this reviewer\'s recommendation.    "

The Mach III served me well, but the head kept coming off, the result of dropping it about 4 dozen too many times.  I\'ve been a Gillette user for a couple of decades, now, but I\'m open to anything which works.  Hint:  I consider any electric, as much as I\'d like to have one, useless.  I\'ve had a few, it was a waste of money for me, but my friends got exceptionally good hand-me-downs.I was *ULTRA-SKEPTICAL* about a 5-bladed razor, *especially* a \'powered\' one.  I mean, my triple-bladed beast was still cranking along, and after 15+ years, I\'ve become accustomed to having my facial hair more pulled out than cut.  It\'s a genentic thing not many people seem to suffer from, which is good for the greater population.  Put it this way, I have \'5 o-clock shadow by 10 AM\'.  It\'s not a good thing.  If I skip shaving for 36 hours, I start to look like a psycho-drifter who has been on the road for a few weeks.Anyway, I sprung for the powered version, figuring I could use all the help I could get.  Shockingly, no pun intended, the shave was not only *amazingly* close, but I didn\'t have the typical 2-5 cuts from having a new blade.  To make matters better, I mananged to have even sideburns for a change.I\'ve been in Vegas about a year and the mid-to-late-70\'s fat Elvis has started to transchannel my sideburns.  Not mutton-chops...yet, but they\'re obvious.  ;-)Anyway, after not my first, but third powered-Fusion shave, about six hours after shaving (at which point I\'d ususally give my wife a rash if I gave her more than a peck on the cheek) I said to her, \'hey, feel my chin.\'  I got an immediate \'WOW!\'  It\'s so nice to look normal for an entire day.There are downsides.  Blades are stupidly expensive and don\'t seem to last more than a week, but the behavior was similar with my Mach III.  I\'ve considered having a ton of cartridges treated with near absolute zero cold, as that appears to help longevity, but have never gotten around to it.    "

Sure, I found a workaround, but why am I working every day for a solution that could be solved by their simply printing them in two shapes clearly needed by the tidy panties community?) ... ahem ... until such time as they give in and build it in thong shape, I shall happily enough settle for these.

I bought it to replace a brush that cost over $150 and it does a better job. The small, rotating head easily gets to the gum line of even the rear teeth.  Only negative is that there is no low battery warning so it will die in the middle of a brushing episode if you don\'t regularly plug in the charger-stand. That\'s a small inconvenience - one not worth $100+.  Just in case, on the day the Oral B is recharging, you can always use the brush given to you by your dentist at your last visit, unless you used it for cleaning grout."

The initial sensation of having 5 blades scrape across my face was a bit unsettling (I imagined a layer of skin being shaved off) but the results were startling. Very close and comfortable shave -- only the beard was removed, not the skin. Single blade on the reverse side works fine for trimming sideburns and under the nose. I used the first blade for 22 shaves and did not nick myself once. I could only get 6-7 shaves out of a Sensor blade so, for me, the high price for Fusion blades is justified.    "

The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct.

Additionally I find their recharge mechanism ingenious, there are no connectors, near as I can tell, it must use a magetic field. What I mean is that the recharge station and linking area on the brush are all both entirely covered in plastic, so there are no \'vulnerable\' spots for bathroom water to reach to short things out or gum up the works.I also find that I take longer brushing my teeth when I use an electric brush, I\'m not sure why I do so, I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.There is one major design flaw though. The moving bristle head has too much clearance between it and the rest of the brush, because it regularly, at least once a day, pinches the inside of my lips or cheeks, often to the point of breaking the skin, and at least once a week bad enough to make my spit turn completely red.It could be that my brush head is defective, I don\'t know, but it definitely happens, and it never happened with any of my previous electric toothbrushes."

Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse, she\'s one of those people that reads the manual on everything first, never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging (which she usually copies down in the store).I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present, but that\'s a whole other story. Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice. The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price. This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you\'re only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her, which she thinks is a must. Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The \'ease of use\' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter. Easier than oral, rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data, and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep, which caused my wife to scowl and panic, but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself. Sure, you can go to Target or Wal-Maze and buy yourself another cheapie, but then you\'ll be back exactly where you are now sometime later ... looking for a dependable and accurate ear Thermometer.This is currently the best.

It is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I\'ve owned, and my last one lasted 13 years. When it started to loose its charge while I was brushing my teeth I looked at what was available and decided on the 5000.I like that it has a space to store 4 brush heads, so I won\'t have to search for where I placed the extra ones when its time to change it. Also, the contour of the handle is very nice.On one of the reviews I read before I bought it, someone was unhappy with the timer. It\'s a nice, waterproof digital clock and you do not have to sync it up with the toothbrush if you don\'t want to. I did so I could tell when I\'m applying too much pressure. If you do use the timer, at 2 minutes you get a smiley face, and at 2 1/2 minutes it winks at you.The one thing I don\'t really like is that every 30 seconds it pulses to let you know to move to the next area of your mouth, but I do not brush my teeth in sections like they want you to. I asked my Dental Hygienist, who also uses one, and she doesn\'t do it their way either.She also recommended that I leave the handle off the charger until the charge wears down. The toothbrush has a \'Smart\' battery and she has heard of people having problems with the battery not holding a charge if it is keep constantly charging. The handle shows how much charge the battery has so I only charge it once a week or so.The travel case that comes with it is another nice feature. Since it holds a charge well, you can take a weekend trip, or a week, if only one person is using the handle, without having to pack the charger.

I\'ve been using this razor for several months, after waiting to hear from others just how well it works.  I have a fairly tough turf, shaving only MWF, resting on the weekends.  Up until this point, I liked Sensor Excel best, and detest every electric unit I\'ve tried. Since I really like the razor, I was surprised by some of the low rankings. I use Edge gel with extra lubricants, and I shave in the shower (yes, these things make a huge difference).Pro:-Blade life appears improved over my Sensor Excel-Vibrating handle not a gimmick, works well once you get used to it. Initially I found a lack of my normal \'feel\' when shaving, but quickly adapted-A beefy well-weighted handle with a secure seal for the battery.  Other razors have popped apart with the blade flying off on me if I dropped them, but not this one.  My Sensor Excel was notorious for this.-Large blade \'eject button\' is nice, yet doesn\'t let the blade pop off prematurely (see above)-The \'hole\' in the handle head is great! I have a wire rack that holds my shampoo and soap.  This same rack has a few \'hangers\' that this razor slides onto nicely-Very good battery life (still on the first one months later)-Plastic holder has a bigger \'foot\' to stay upright better and it\'s easier to see at a glance how many blades that I have left due to the clear sides, a feature that my Sensor lacks-On/off button flashes when battery gets low... hard to miss and allows you to get a least one shave-Best for last: a very close shave on a very tough faceCon:-Razor head is large, single blade on the back is a good idea and is sharp, but I can\'t seem to make it work as good as it sounds. It\'s a first generation idea that I am hoping gets some refinement.-Price... Ouch! Fewer blades per pack AND much more expensive. Buy in bulk, look for sales, save coupons-Plastic tray is much larger than my Sensor yet holds fewer spare blades (4).-Old blades from Sensor are not compatible with Fusion (you can mitigate this problem by taking your old shaver to work for those embarrassing days when you miss a small spot)Bottom line: Recommended if you\'ve got a rough face!

Upon receiving the product, it did not look anything like the original brush heads that I received with the toothbrush I bought months ago from Amazon. The primary differences were: the bristles were the wrong color(the center green was a darker translucent color instead of the opaque light green), the bristles were splayed out instead of in tight clusters, and the gray logo was much lighter. I chalked this up to maybe changes in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the first brush head I tried did not work at all. I chalked that up to manufacturing defect. The second one worked, but didn\'t quite feel right. I decided to just go with it however, and after a month the brush head became very loose. I saw the other reviews and photos and realized that I had received fake product directly from Amazon.Here is the worst part. I decided to purchase replacement heads from Walgreens retail store. I got home and realized that they were also fake product. So, then I went to Target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine. I was floored to find fake product in a retail chain store as well as at Amazon.So, TLDR buyer beware of fake product when ordering online or shopping at retail. Look at the brush heads carefully before you make your purchase. It seems like there is a major counterfeiting problem right now and it hopefully gets resolved soon."

Generally, I go for pads that are long and have wings. These particular pads are not the kind I usually go for but I decided to give them a shot. I was actually pleasantly surprised with these!Let\'s talk about the positives first. I generally can\'t go through a period without ruining at least one pair of underwear. I can say that with these, I didn\'t soil my underwear at all. Not even one drop. Also, I\'ve found that pads that don\'t have wings tend to move around a bit but these stayed firmly in place.Now for a couple of negatives. First, as I said above, I like pads with wings. When I wear pads without wings, I\'m always afraid that the pad is going to shift and I\'m going to bleed right through my pants. Although I didn\'t have a problem with these pads, I wish they had wings just for the peace of mind. Second, I don\'t think the light scent did anything to control the odor.Overall, these work pretty well in absorbing and staying put. Although I generally don\'t go for these kinds of pads, it did what it was supposed to do."

We\'d sing the Tigger song while brushing, which helped make things fun. But I have a couple complaints:1. The whole thing is a little large and cumbersome for a 3-year-old. Getting the back teeth is tricky for him, and when we take over to \'do finishing touches,\' we\'d always end up bonking him on the teeth/ gums/ lips with part of this toothbrush. This made him mad, and when you are trying to convince a toddler that toothbrushing is fun, you do not want to make him mad.2. The brush head is not replaceable. So once the bristles are worn, you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one. Sure, the purchase price is cheap, but like so many things, that is not the \'real cost,\' once you factor in how many you\'ll have to buy and how many you put in the landfill. (Batteries are replaceable but the toothbrush is not rechargeable.) I recommend getting one that allows you to replace the head and keep the Tigger.We are now looking at the Sonicare kids toothbrush, which is much more expensive but which includes two different-size brushheads for growing with-- and bonus, it\'s rechargeable."

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

At first, I was shocked.  This thing vibrates (like a buzz) your head when brushing the top teeth.  It is kind of like a dentist drill but much more dynamic.  It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \'dentist office\' cleaning.  After one week I have already seen the difference.  The company advertises two weeks, but one will show results.  It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  The bristles are somewhat hard without the slightest irritation to the gums.  Since this device uses NiCad batteries, I do not keep the charger plugged.  It has gone 2 weeks without need for recharging.  That is amazing.The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  The \'timer\' feature is great and is very useful.  The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  The tiny brush (floss head) supplied with it is useless.  I wish they would have placed an extra tooth brush in it\'s place.  The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  It is hardly bigger than a manual tooth brush.I very much recommend this tooth brush.  There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.

There are youtube videos that demonstrate hack jobs requiring the user to break the seals and remove solder points and circuit board components, but I don\'t consider that to be a user friendly service by any means. This is a serious design flaw that one might suspect as being intentional (a battery costs about twenty bucks, but Braun/Oral-B would probably rather sell a whole new system for over a hundred bucks). This also makes it difficult to recycle the battery apart from the rest of the plastic and electronics. This is not a green technology and it is obvious that Braun/Oral-B do not care about customers or the environment very much.

Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but the Pulsonic leaves me a bit unsure.The design of this brush is very reminiscent of the Sonicare toothbrushes, right down to the stand which always looked different on all the previous Oral-B electric brushes. This design really looks like a stripped-down baby version of the Sonicare.First of, the brush itself is extremely slim and light-weight for an electric brush. So much so that one wonders whether it can actually \'do the job\'. So after charging it the required 12 hours, I tried it out for the first time. I did not find it any different in power than the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, it felt the same.What is different is that the Pulsonic\'s manual instructs the user to move the brush over the teeth in a circular motion, very much like one is supposed to do with a manual brush. I, for one, didn\'t quite like this although I can see the benefit of doing it this way. The Pulsonic has - like the Sonicare and unlike the Oral-B Triumph - a regular (yet contoured) brush head. The shape of such a brush head makes it difficult  to sufficiently cover the entire tooth. One is always either cleaning along the gumline or more towards the bite. Using circular motion prevents that only parts of the teeth are cleaned. Yet - I have been using electric toothbrushes for so long that I have gotten used to not really having to do anything but hold the brush head to the teeth. So this is a change I am not sure I like too much.Also - these rectangular brush heads don\'t seem to work too well for me personally. I have a small mouth and find it difficult to easily brush my teeth with these brush heads, especially the insides of the front teeth. It always feels as if I can\'t quite reach all the surfaces, especially the areas along the gumline, and that leaves me wondering whether I get as complete a cleaning as I should be getting.Philips has tried to address this problem by offering a smaller brush head for the Sonicare, but Oral-B doesn\'t seem to have that. So this is not optimal for me.What I did like about the Pulsonic though is that it comes with a second \'Precision Tip\' brush head. I found this to be a great way to really get into the spaces between teeth and I give Oral-B a big thumbs-up for this one.Lastly, the Pulsonic, like the other models and brands, informs the user audibly when it is time to change to a different \'quadrant\' to be brushed, and when the two minutes recommended brush time are over.All in all this is probably a brush I will take along when travelling - the light weight but equal power output make it perfect for that, but at home I will likely stay with the Oral-B Triumph and its round brush heads. I just feel that these heads reach all areas of my teeth better and also feel more comfortable on the sensitive areas of my mouth."

Ingrown hairs and razor bumps were a weekly, if not daily occurance for me. I started off as a teenager with the original Sensor. When that got too painful I transitioned to the Sensor Excel. That served me well through my college years, where I could get away with shaving every 2 or 3 days. I found that my face needed a day or 2 off before I could shave comfortably again. When I entered the workforce, the president of my company noticed the stubble on my face during my \'off\' days and insisted that I shave every day. Well, after about a week of daily use with the Excel, my neck was about as raw and sore as it ever had been. That was about the time that Gillette introduced the Mach3. I transitioned to that, and eventually the Mach3 Turbo, but I was STILL getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps.I did some research and found that my technique (shaving against \'the grain\' without shaving with the grain first) was causing a great deal of my problems, so I started to change my ways with less than stellar results. The Mach3 was designed to be used \'against the grain\', and shaving in the direction of my hair growth produced almost no results at all. I couldn\'t even feel the razor cutting anything as I pulled it down along my face and neck. In addition, the added width of the blades made it nearly impossible to shave the areas underneath my nostrils. I had to keep my old Sensor handy to tackle that area when I was done with the rest of my face. My fiancee suggested spending $20 on the new battery-powered Mach3...no, thank you!Then I saw the Senor3, and decided to give it a try. The blades were cheaper than the Mach3 (even at Costco Warehouse prices), so it wasn\'t much of an investment for the experiment. All I have to say is, \'THANK GOODNESS!\' The Sensor3 has the best of both worlds between the Excel and the Mach3. The blades fit any Sensor handle, which is a more traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn\'t have to invest in a whole new system. It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it\'s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors AND I can get to the area under my nose. But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results. To the outside world I look clean-shaven every day, even though I can feel a tiny bit of stubble. That\'s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.I now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I\'m as smooth as a baby\'s backside. I\'ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort. The \'Art of Shaving\' products are a godsend. Invest in the Pre-Shave oil, trust me. I also went \'retro\' and picked up their shaving cream and brush. Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it\'s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route. I think I FINALLY found something that works for me after 15 years of shaving!    "

I switched to a safety razor for facial shaving more years ago than I care to remember and I have yet to find a disposable or replaceable or for that matter rechargeable (and I have tried quite a few) that comes anywhere close to equaling the resultant closeness of cut or smoothness particularly when those infuriating independent gray hairs that crop up under the chin are considered. However, I am not as adept in avoiding a sling blade result on the back of my head with a safety razor so I am constantly in the market to identify a disposable or replaceable that fills the bill.To that end, the ProGlide is acceptable but I still had to make several passes on the back of my head to get a smooth, minimally stubby result, not unlike the outcomes with a Mach 3 or Schick 3... or one of the five rechargeables currently residing in one bathroom or another. Interesting enough, I also got better results on my head with the back side trimmer single blade than the front side five blade shredder.  I didn\'t feel any discomfort like pulling or tugging or experience any inadvertent nicks. Actually, I was mildly surprised that it had cut as close as it did since it felt like it was not cutting at all which I suppose is somewhat of an endorsement.However, with the ongoing cost of replacement cartridges, for my needs there are far too many less expensive, equally beneficial alternatives.

I found a Fekkai product not too long ago tht finally relaxed things enough to where my hair started to look normal and shiny again. But Fekkai products are spendy and I was still hoping to find something more budget friendly. This fits the bill. It is about 1/3 the price of the Fekkai product and it a comparable job. I used about a dime sized amount for shoulder length hair.I let my hair air dry, and my waves actually curled up quite nicely.

I had a similar styler, but the blades were dull and a pain to groom myself with. It\'s quick, fast and easy to use, helping you to always look your best with all your quick grooming needs.For as cheap as the Gillette styler was, it sure is my new favorite tool to groom with! It\'s got a lot of nice features that more expensive stylers have, but for around only $20, plus it\'s water proof for use in the shower! First off let\'s start with the fact that it uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges, how amazing is that? I can now toss out my old fusion power pro-glide handle since this one works even better. The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates just as well, if not better than the standard power handles on the disposable shavers.The handle is nicely molded, very clean look and provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not hard plastic, so you won\'t find yourself dropping the styler or having it slip out of your palms. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding.You can use the standard motorized blade directly on your skin without worrying about cutting yourself, or scratching up your skin. It\'s sharp, but only for your hair. It also includes 3 different style \'combs\' to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you\'d want to trim. With all these little plastic attachments here and there though, you\'ll need a place to store it all! Gillette is two steps ahead of you, because the packing it comes in also doubles as a stand and accessory holder for the styler itself, and all the little attachments included.One nice thing not many shavers or stylers have is the ability to open the compartment behind the blade to clean out hair that can cause jams. The Gillette styler has a hatch you can pop off, and snap right back down to clean out any hair or gunk so your styler never jams, and will always work reliably. This is a huge plus for me since my old one was becoming weak and dull from all the hair trapped in the mechanism slowing down the blade and motor.Besides the styler and the accessories, I received Gillette brand cooling lotion to use after shaving, and non burning shaving gel. I tried both, and liked them very much. The shaving gel made my hairs pirk right up after a few seconds, making shaving so much easier. I felt no burn or sting while using the gel, so it really does work. Afterwards I put some of the lotion into my palms and rubbed it onto my face where I had shaved, it did have a nice cooling effect, but I could have lived without the lotion, it has a nice light scent to it too.For under $20, the Gillette Styler really can\'t be beat. It\'s cheap in price, high quality, comes with tons of accessories and samples, and it does a good job. It would make a great gift to any guy you know, or a gift to yourself!    "

I used it for the first time yesterday and can\'t say I find it all that superior.  I did feel it left a smooth shave, but so does the Divine (3 blade version).  The handle felt no different as well, which is apparently one of the selling points to the Embrace since the handle has a bit of cushion and non-skid material.  The blade itself is fairly bulky, and can totally understand the concerns over it\'s size for more delicate areas with curves being more difficult to maneuver around.  The 5 blades are so closely stacked that it clogs quickly if you have more than 1 day of stubble to take care of.My biggest concern with this razor was that it had drag.  The blade cartridge has some \'special\' moisture strips or whatever they are meant to be that just grate over my skin.  It kept making me nervous that I was creating nicks up my legs!  I do have very sensitive skin, so perhaps this is why I didn\'t like the sensation of the actual cartridge, but I wouldn\'t imagine a well lathered leg (with Gillette\'s own shaving cream!) would create such a noxious scratchy drag.But, all this said, the razor gets the job done.  Once I use up the two cartridges/blades that comes with this razor, I will attach the Divine blades to it- which is a good selling point to have a razor that has the capacity to use all of the Venus blades.

Because of how weird and long they get, they would start to come out (without even having absorbed anything yet!) and rub weird and hurt even more :/"

I like the slim design, and it seems to clean the teeth well. The problem is that the toothbrush head fell off twice during use. Maybe it is vibrating off?

The Fusion ProGlide Styler is a versatile, powerful-yet-gentle grooming tool. I\'ve always been reluctant to put a powered razor on my skin, so I also purchased the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Clear Shave Gel to serve as a conditioning buffer between skin and machine. I am impressed by the ProGlide\'s range of function in the shower. I\'ve found that the trimmer trims a lot more than beard, if you know what I mean. The kit includes enough accessories to make even the most high maintenance well-groomed person happy. On the down side, the cartridges sell at a price that would only make a Gillette stockholder happy, but they have a stellar performer on their shelves.    "

I was reluctant to try the  fusion, but a sample was included with my morning paper delivery a year ago, who would have thought to include it with the paper?Anyway, after using the first razor and cartridge, the closeness of the shave was incredible! I used it for almost 3 months before having to bite the bullet and buy cartridges.The shave from this razor is incredibly close, with no irritation. My beard grows every which way, leading to some discomfort with single or twin blade cartridges. This shaver, while refills can be expensive, provided a closeness in the shave I have never experienced before.I have achieved a longer use per refill, partly I think, because I do not use a traditional shave cream. I use \'Kiss my Face\' shave cream, which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge, while also providing a better and closer shave, with far less irritation.If you use this, try different shave creams, and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses. This will help to lengthen the life of the cartridges.One caveat... my beard is not thick, and I do sport a goatee, which may also help with longevity of cartridges. I currently use one cartridge every six weeks or so.    "

Has a handy timer/wall clock unit to tell you when you\'ve reached the two minute recommended brushing time, but I always exceed that since I like a good scrubbing on the choppers.No issues at all so far with the unit.  The real test will be when I return to my dentist (who had in fact recommended this unit) and see if the cleaning is shorter or if they notice any difference.I\'ll update after that happens.Overall, I\'m completely pleased and think that it\'s probably a good investment.

And then, there is the rare product that comes along which goes beyoyond the hype and acclaim. And which exceeds all expectations. Allow me to introduce to you the latter, the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush. I will not take up too much time by reiterating all the 5-star reviews. But do read these reviews; because they are right on the money. One review in particular claimed how using this product cured his bad breath problem. This claim really got my attention. I too suffered from bad breath. And no amount of brushing or tongue scraping would solve the problem of bad breath. So this claim along with many of the other positive reviews persuaded me to give the Oral-B a try. Results...Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Upon initial use it felt like I had been to the dentist office for a dental cleaning (and like so every time after use). And yes...no more bad breath...simply amazing!  Is the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush worth the price? Consider the convenience of getting a truly professional dental cleaning (at home) without having to go to a Dental Hygienist. Also, consider the cost involved of going to a dental hygienist for cleaning every six months or so. The Oral-B is worth the price many many many times over.  Note: If you have not had cleaning for a while (or not good cleaning), you may experience slight bleeding of the gums for a couple of weeks of use. As the toothbrush rids your dentals of the old and new trapped food particles (which will turn to plaque via bacteria if not cleaned of), you will experience bleeding less and less until no more. Be advised, the sticker that attaches the timer/clock to a surface, like a wall, is of industrial strength. When it sticks it stays sticked. You may pull away some of your wall, or other used surface, if you try to remove it after sticking it on. Like me, you may choose not to use sticker and just place timer/clock on sink counter-top (or a stand for eye level). However, I now use the timer/clock as a bathroom clock mostly. Because the the Oral-B toothbrush device also has a built-in timer guide. The quadrant cleaning method illustrated in the user manual seemed a bit tedious for me. I have developed a more desirable method for myself. This procedure is as follows: starting from the top chop going left outer...moving to back then going inner around to other side until at that back then around that outer side to where I started (spending a second or two on each tooth). And likewise with my bottom chop. Time-wise, the whole procedure takes around two minutes or so. You can follow the user manual guide or develop your own strategy. The main thing is to make sure that you reach all tooth and gum areas (top and bottom chops; inner and outer surfaces, and top of dentals).  Now then! How quickly should you get the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush? Don\'t walk. Don\'t skip or hop! Don\'t even run!! But warp-speed!!! And seek a desirable  merchant to acquire this dental magician."

I\'m serious people, you will not be disappointed with this razor.You can say goodbye to cuts and razor bumps with the Proglide Fusion. If you have a problem with razor bumps like I did, here are some tips:1. For the best results, don\'t shave for a week before the first time you use the Proglide Fusion. This will allow for many of your razor bumps to heal.2. Shave in a hot shower. This will open up your pores and make shaving easier.3. Don\'t press the razor hard to your face/neck. Use gentle short swipes as the super thin blades do not require you to gash your face in order to get a close shave.You should also note that this razor has a single blade trimmer on the back side for areas that require precision such as side burns and under the nose.The refills may be expensive, but they are worth it.

At first, this veteran user of the EB17 Flexisoft head was a bit skeptical. But after a few days use, I have a new favorite.The dual-brush head is a bit bigger than the traditional round head. The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars. But this head is great for quickie between meal cleaning, and as a bonus is pretty good at brushing off my tongue.This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure. Since EB17s usually run about $5 per head in 3-, 4-, and 6-packs, finding the EB417 about the same price is a relief. You really DO want to replace heads every few months, after the outer blue bristles fade half-way down."

Now, I know this isn\'t a magical indicator of some kind, but every other fusion blade I\'ve used from the store has had the blue bar on there for about as long as the razor quality lasts.

The increase? 38% higher than the original price. So what\'s the deal?? Does Amazon hook people in for automatic purchases for items similar to this that use the Gillette business model? Get them hooked then increase the cost, in hopes that the consumer doesn\'t notice or is too lazy to cancel?? I\'m extremely disappointed and fairly annoyed. This is a bad business practice. If you\'re going to offer a subscription on a product at a set price, then try honoring that price, not an immediate increase of 38% once you have the consumer signed up.

It\'s great for people on the go, easy to put in a gym bag etc. It\'s also less stuff cluttering your shower, which I\'m down for. On first use, it works great. Shaves easily, no nicks, close shave. It is a little stringy( seeing little strings of gel from the razor to your skin), but it doesn\'t really make a difference using it, its just a little odd. My legs felt nice afterwards, not parched and dry. But I always follow up with a shea body butter when I get out of the shower anyway, so that\'s never been a big concern of mine.The down side is that the shaving gel bar part is going to be gone long before the razor(maybe after 3-4 uses). I use my Venus cartridges probably longer then most...1: because I\'m not obsessed with the closest shave ever and 2: because I feel guilt pangs whenever I throw something like this in the garbage(trying to be green here!). So eventually I know I\'ll be using this particular razor with my traditional shaving cream despite the fact that it started off easy-peasy. Would I buy it again?

In theory, it\'s a great idea: it\'s difficult to get sharp symmetrical lines using an ordinary razor, and one would think a single blade would do the trick a lot better. In practice, though, this doesn\'t work. In the first place, either the blade isn\'t sharp enough or it\'s burried too deep inside the cartridge to be truly precise. And secondly, whatever hairs it trims just get stuck in the blade - and it\'s a real pain to get them out.The good. Fusion isn\'t worse than Mach3. This was actually a great relief following the disappointment of M3Power which was a disaster. I can\'t say yet if Fusion gives a superior shave to Mach3 Turbo, but it stands to reason that five blades would perform better than three.    "

It cleans your teeth fantastically, and it really leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean like no other toothbrush in the world. The first time you use the product, you will definitely feel the difference in your mouth, because it will feel much cleaner. It gently massages your gun as well, thus improving gum health.

I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I\'m lucky enough to have a window and sill.For that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don\'t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life. And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all. The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical. But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again. I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).In my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months. Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don\'t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B."

On my old Braun electric toothbrushes the head rotated and oscillated, on this toothbrush the head pulsates or vibrates.Is it any better? The shape of the toothbrush head seems better designed to fit the shape or your teeth, and it is larger than the old design, large enough to cover two teeth. But while the head is larger in surface area it is much slimmer in profile so it is much more comfortable to use, it feeling much smaller in the mouth. I also like the timer function, it has an overall two minute timer, but it gives a signal every 15 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth.I like this new toothbrush, it seems as efficient as the old style Braun but is much more comfortable to use, and it is a little quieter too. It is also much easier to clean their being no inner workings as on the old style heads, which I am sure must be much more hygienic too.As the toothbrush should run for a week on a single 14 hour charge it is not necessary to replace the toothbrush on the charger after every use, so the charger does not need to be in the bathroom. Using the toothbrush this way should prolong the the life of the rechargeable battery tooHowever, as yet their does not appear to be an Interspace toothbrush head (which I need to reach awkward spaces) available to fit the toothbrush, so at the moment I am using both the old, with the Interespace head, and the new.

A friend gave me this and I\'m actually shocked. Not ONLY could I easily floss my teeth, but within two weeks the inflammation(Known more commonly as gingivitis)was died down to a very manageable point, and within three it was practically completely gone.Crest and their entire line of \'Pro-Health\' items have been absolutely AMAZING for my teeth.

Years ago my dentist recommended Sonicare and I have been a faithful user of them, upgrading when new models came along.  My dental visits have reflected that use.My hygienist prefers Oral-B and we have talked about it over the years.  I wasn\'t persuaded.  Recently Oral-B started a 50% off campaign and with their 60 day return policy I thought I would try them out.I am glad I did.  I very much like this toothbrush and how it works.  It is bigger than my Sonicare Flex, but even so it feels very good in my hand.  I love the smart timer.  While the Sonicare gives you a beep/jar every 30 seconds, you can see your progress with the Oral-B on the timer.  The Oral-B also gives you a jar too.  In fact, this is the one thing I don\'t like about it.  It is too much of a jar, especially at the 2 minute mark.  It is as if your car is about to stall.After two minutes the Sonicare shuts off.  The Oral-B keeps going until you shut it off.  I am finding that I keep on using it for another 30 to 60 seconds.  Now you can select a deep clean cycle of 3 minutes rather than the normal 2 minute cycle, but I find I prefer going through the normal cycle and then concentrating on the areas my dentist has mentioned as needing extra attention for another 30/60 seconds.The brushes seem to be fine.  I have used the ones that came with the package but also the sensitive head.  I like the sensitive head best.  It is a bit more compact and seems to get the job done.I will know how effective it is for me when I next visit the dentist for a cleaning.But for now, my feeling is that I am doing a better job in brushing and concentrating on the problem areas.I am keeping this and sending in for the rebate."

The Gillette multiblade systems are very forgiving of rushed shaving, and truly do a pretty good job.  That said, I\'d need to be able to shave in a tenth of a second to justify $3.50 or more per cartridge.  Seriously, Gillette?For times when you have a little more time to shave, I\'d recommend a good old-fashioned safety razor.  With a little more time for shaving, and a little attention to technique, you can get shaves with an old safety razor that are as good or better than anything you can do with a Gillette Fusion.Besides having razor blades that cost a tenth as much as the Fusion cartridges, a classic styled Merkur safety razor is a solid, well-made tool.  Much more satisfying to use than anything made of plastic.  And a puck of good quality shaving soap might cost $10 or less, and it will last you an entire year.  To top it all off, safety razors are more environmentally sound than the plasticky Gillettes.  No pressurized metal cans of goo, and the double-edged blades are inexpensive to manufacture and to purchase.More tips:  Proraso shave cream in the green metal tube is the best.  Gillette 7 o\'clock sharp edge double edge blades (made in Russia) are great and inexpensive - $34 for  100 at the time of this review.  I\'ve been using a Merkur model 180 for five years now, and love it.    "

I liked the slim design and two speed options.  The brush head looked more like a traditional manual toothbrush.  It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can\'t say that they appear whiter.  I find that the 30 second timer and two minute marker to be both helpful yet a bit annoying- its nice to know how long you\'ve been working on a section of teeth but I tend to brush longer than the recommended 2 minutes so it isn\'t broken up to my needs.Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  The Pulsonic seems a bit flimsy- like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  I also don\'t feel like the bristles get in between my teeth like the Sonicare did, either.  The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn\'t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.  I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!"

I have to say though that I\'m quite impressed with how easy it was to use this Gillette Venus razor and how well it worked.There is no need for any shaving cream or gel at all - the moisturizing bars that encase the razor do an excellent job of providing the traction you need once they get wet, they leave a very slick almost gooey path along the surface of your skin as you go along.Overall I found this super-easy to use, I was able to shave my legs in much less time.  The only drawback I found was that I don\'t think I was able to shave quite as close as I normally am able to when using a plain razor and shaving cream.  I found after when running my hands across the surface of my legs when they were dry that they weren\'t quite as smooth, but it was still definitely a very good job and a great time-saver.    "

I got the idea to try to replace the battery but the case has no easy way of opening and my attempt resulted in a shattered case -- it went in my batteries-to-be-recycled bag. I have an Oral-B Vitality I got cheap for under $20 over a year ago because I like to have more than one electric toothbrush (big house). However, it\'s action seemed primitive to me compared to my Sonicares, so I started shopping. Costco has a current coupon on a pair of Sonicares but I decided to look online and see what I could find out and/or buy.I decided on the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 in spite of the fact that there appears to be no rebate available for it at this time. The reasons I decided on the 5000 are several. Firstly, it appears to be not difficult to replace the battery when the time comes. The replacement batteries are easily found on ebay and several of those listings (and other YouTube videos) feature  detailed instructions on how to do the replacement. You do have to use a solder iron, but I\'ve been handy with one since I was a teenager, so no big deal. I would not buy another Sonicare if I thought it might not be possible to replace the battery.Why get the best Oral-B going in spite of the price? I am a frugal guy, extremely so, but in this instance I figure it\'s time to splurge. I have only one set of teeth. The dentist does not scare me, nor the oral surgeon, but I know that the bills can come to literally thousands of dollars. If I obsess a little on my oral hygiene, so much the better! My wallet, teeth, breathe and smile will all benefit! Oh, and my general health. Oral health is a very important part of one\'s overall health.I discovered that the extra brushes I bought for my Oral-B Vitality will work fine with my 5000, cool!The Smart Guide? Well, it\'s OK, it\'s a plus, but no biggie. The biggest advantage of it is if you use more than one mode. It shows you which brushing mode you are using, and it is possible to be in a mode you didn\'t know you were in unless you glance at the Smart Guide. This happened once to me already. I hadn\'t intended to use other than the default mode, but I\'d inadvertently pressed the mode advance button.When I got the 5000, it had no charge and I set it in the charging cradle but nothing happened and I thought maybe the battery was bad. I\'d looked at the instructions on charging but hadn\'t read down to the short paragraph where it says that the battery icon on the handle\'s LCD may not appear for 10-15 minutes the first time you charge it. I still hadn\'t seen that part of the instructions when I got the idea to place the handle in the charging cradle of my Sonicare brush, thinking the Oral-B\'s might be inoperative. Just a second or two in that cradle gave the battery enough oomph to show the battery icon, I then charged it fully in the Oral-B\'s cradle and everything\'s been fine since.The Sonicares I had would pulse briefly every 30 seconds and turn off after 2 minutes. The Oral-B does the every-30-second pulsing, but keeps on going when the 2 minutes is up. I like the fact that the Oral-B keeps on going and lets me decide when I want to turn it off.I picked up mine off ebay for about $12 less than the lowest price I\'ve seen here. The price here has varied by about $10 (i.e. 10%) just over the last week. If I were in no hurry I\'d have waited for another 50% off rebate offer, however.You have to insert the brush in your mouth before turning it on so as not to spray toothpaste all over.  Likewise, you have to turn it off before removing it from your mouth. After doing that, I place it under running tap water, and while holding it under the stream of water I turn on the brush for a few seconds and let it clean itself of toothpaste, then turn off the tap leaving the brush running for a few more seconds to let it shake off most of the water so it will dry quickly.I\'ve always brushed before flossing. I always use a dental pick as well (strongly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist, it\'s the end of a round toothpick, held in a handle called the \'perio-aid 3\', given me by my dentist). A couple of days ago I started wondering if I should really brush first and did an Internet search on the subject and found out that brushing is recommended to come last because dislodging plaque from the tooth/gum-line gives your fluoride toothpaste access to the tooth surfaces, re-mineralizing those surfaces, making them more resistant to decay. So, now I\'m brushing last."

Believe me...been there, done that.How incredibly stupid and short-sighted of Pantene to discontinue this line, and all the others. From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers\' preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...well. Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers. \'Flat\' indeed!!I will now have to stock up on my regular Volume favorites at premium prices from elsewhere and try and find something else that works when that runs out. I am super pissed! Just one more thing that I love, discontinued once again.Once I find a new product line that works, you may rest assured that I will NEVER buy another Pantene product ever again. "

That may be true in some instances, but what I didn\'t realize until I tried this toothbrush was that most people probably love their electric toothbrushes because they work so much better than a traditional toothbrush.  I\'m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that \'just came from the dentist\' clean feeling.I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in \'timer\' that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  I don\'t think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you\'re done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush, I purchased five heads for the price of 3 of the brand-name ones.The only feature I don\'t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you\'re using too much pressure when you brush.  I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on, I can\'t imagine most people normally brush that hard.  So for me this was not a necessary option, it\'s just there though and doesn\'t interfere with the use of the brush in any way.I only wish I had discovered the ease and pleasure of having such clean teeth earlier - I definitely recommend this brush!"

(I ordered 5x the item of 6 brushes/ea, so 3 bucks S&H for 30 brush heads).Other sellers came somewhat close in pricing but wanted $7-10 S&H fees, not to mention that some would limit you to 1 item (of 3 brushes)/order. So if I wanted to increase the quantity to get the 30 brush heads I got from BelowCostJML, I would have to literally place the order 10 times and pay the ludicrous S&H cost 10x!I\'m thankful for BelowCostJML\'s fair pricing, including S&H and for their great service! The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time. Very pleased with the service!The product speaks for itself, I\'ve been a satisfied user for 8 years and I personally find it gentler in the mouth than Sonicare [I\'ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque (it\'s just a matter of each individual\'s preference)... I guess the \'difference\' would be equivalent to Pepsi versus Coke if you will (not that I\'m encouraging regular consumption of either): they give you the same overall effect, it just depends which one you prefer best.

I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the \'comfort guard\' helps make it a smooth cut. And the power part is a big help; once I\'m done, it\'s a closer shave than the Mach III was. I also have a goatee, and the main blade of the Fusion can actually trim the edges.There are only 2 minor negatives to the Fusion: Cleaning out the comfort guard is a bit of a hassle, and the blue guard makes it hard to see any hair (mine is dark brown) that\'s been caught in it; and the battery indicator is basically useless. It\'s been \'low\' for several weeks, and a brand new battery didn\'t make a difference. So I guess when the razor stops working I\'ll know the battery is dead.Overall, a good step up from a simple razor.Update (11/17/07): It seems I misunderstood the battery indicator, which I apparently didn\'t look at very closely when I bought the razor. I thought the battery symbol on the razor would indicate when the battery was low, and that\'s why I thought it was \'low\' for so long; I didn\'t realize that it was like that all the time! The entire area around the battery symbol and the power button will actually flash orange when the battery is low, as I discovered this week. So I apologize to anyone that might have read my review and was misinformed because of it. And now the only minor negative about the razor is still the issue of cleaning the comfort guard.On the positive side, however, it seems the Fusion will last quite a while on one battery: Mine was still going strong in April when I originally posted this review -- and I had had the razor for some time then -- and despite the fact that I don\'t shave every day, the original battery (which I put back in after a new one didn\'t matter) lasted until now.

I always get a good report from the dentist, but this tooth brush is so much better than that!  This brush gives you the fresh from the dentist feel.  While the brush head is a little bit smaller than the spin brush it works great!  There is an indicator light that tells you when you are brushing too hard.  I have read some other reviews comparing this to the next model up and one of the  major differences is that the charging station and the tooth brush have the indicator light but as long as you brush in front of the mirror you can see the light on the toothbrush and if you aren\'t brushing in front of the mirror you wouldnt see the light on the base either unless you don\'t have a mirror over you sink or don\'t have your toothbrush at your sink, neither of which makes much sense!

However, this razor really pulls at the underarms while shaving, and my underarms were quite senstive after shaving. Plus, this razor is pretty big (got to put 5 blades and a moisture ribbon somewhere), and that made it difficult to see while shaving my underarms.The storage pod for the shower? Clever idea, but try getting the thing open with wet hands. I\'ve found that it either pops open when I want it closed or won\'t open when I need it.Overall, this is a great razor for the legs. I like the smooth, close shave that it provides. However, after my underarm experience on 2 different occasions, I won\'t even attempt to use this for bikini areas (ouch). It\'s a bit too bulky for detail work, I think. That means I have to have 2 different razors, and that\'s a bit much.

The Embrace is the first time I feel like they\'ve improved on the original design.  The Breeze has a similar moisture ribbon, but it always melts off before the blades are worn out, and the heads are just too expensive for that to be tolerable.The moisture ribbon on the Embrace is pretty solid to the touch so you really don\'t get any more than you need and it doesn\'t melt prematurely.  There\'s no residue on my legs when I\'m done shaving, just smooth skin.  The best part is I can have both legs shaved from ankle to hip in one third of the time it used to take me to shave with other razors because I don\'t need to use shave gel, and the handle and the shape of the head make it really hard to cut myself, so I can just go zip-zop.The only issue I\'ve had is that it\'s slightly tricky to shave armpits with the Embrace because the head is so big, and it\'s a bit difficult to maneuver in intimate areas.  It\'s no less effective than other razors, it just takes some adaptation and adds a little time.  That said, all in all, my total shave time -- legs, armpits, intimate region -- is half of what it used to be, and that\'s more than worth the price of the Embrace.    "

While there are a few safe ingredients, I was concerned about a few of the chemicals listed.  I wish manufacturers would also stop adding fragrance.  If deodorant has it, and hair spray has it, and you use perfume, how many fragrances do you need at one time?  But until more women feel this way, companies are likely compelled to add yet one more chemical to the mix.  To be REALLY fair, I would probably go to a store and read the ingredients on a lot more shampoo bottles.  Pro-V may not be any worse than other shampoos.While I am not chemically sensitive, others are.  But these people are probably buying products at the health food store instead of the drug store.

637,217,225,20090316,B0001LQGEM,3,"March 16, 2009",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,Average performance,"After using this razor for a short period of time, I feel compelled to tell others how it stacks up in the world of razors. With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one. The cartridges are still available in some stores, however. This review specifically covers the Sensor3 cartridge system.Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor3. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Sensor3 cartridges are noticeably smaller than the Mach 3 cartridges, by comparison. The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.The shave: 3 stars. I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving. I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days\' facial hair growth. The angle of the blade takes some getting used to. I noticed several times that I placed the blade on my face at the wrong angle, presumably because of my adjustment to the Mach 3/Fusion/Quattro razors which seem to have a more linear handle design. The biggest problem I encountered were several cuts. Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors. I do note that the shave was close, but comfort was lacking.Durability: 3 stars. This is the durability rating I give to the Sensor3 disposables. I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges. Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.Overall: The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable). For razor systems, one would be advised to choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.    "

When I first opened it, I was confused. I\'d never seen anything like it. It was so strangely light and yet didn\'t seem like it should be. The material made me think of memory foam, only super soft textured.With how thin it was at the top, I didn\'t think it would be impressive for my flow (I have endometriosis, so that means I always have to wear overnight or better, maximum protection pads to keep up with my super flow, sometimes in addition to a tampon, which I hate wearing). Well, it worked great and it really felt like I didn\'t have anything on.I decided to actually buy the product this period to see if it was just a fluke and put it to the test immediately with my worst time--overnight on my heaviest night. When even the best pads have failed me in the past.Not a drop off the pad. The wings held and only in one place did it even leave the center of the top (the entire bottom was filled). And I felt DRY. If I hadn\'t seen the bottom, I\'d have thought maybe there was no flow overnight.I tried another today and got that familiar \'overproducing\' feeling that always leads to pad failure. I went to the bathroom, expecting a mess and the pad had contained it completely. It hadn\'t approached any edges. I was shocked and amazed. I\'ve never had a pad work this well, in 15 years of super-heavy periods, that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage.What\'s more, I almost always get irritation on this day in my cycle. Nada. I am SOLD.So, to recap: it held more than any other pad I\'ve seen that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage. It left NO irritation on a heavy day. It worked overnight on my worst night. And I feel dry--it absorbs faster than anything I\'ve ever worn. I\'ve never felt compelled to review a product as strongly as this before, lol. Probably hormones ;)"

They are described in the instructions, and there is a $3 coupon included inside the box.After approximately two and one-half minutes, the brush slows down and gives a couple of sluggish spurts, which signals time to stop brushing. It doesn\'t stop by itself and has to be turned off. It is compact and fits well in smaller hands.  I wasn\'t expecting too much from this little toothbrush but was very surprised at its vigorous action.  My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after use.  I can\'t determine how long the battery will last, as I\'ve used it only for a couple of weeks.  I am sold on Oral-b, and certainly will consider this brand when its time for my next automatic toothbrush."

I find it objectable that manufacturers continue to just keep producing razors with more and more blades. We then have the option to get new razor or if lucky we receive a free one in the mail. They make the money on those blades. They now have 5 individual blades per cartridge and the cost about $3.50 each in an 8 pack. I opt for my excellent double blade razor that I have used for 15 years and buy the best double edge blades at about 30 cents each. Then a excellent Neutrogena Shave Creme with SPF15. I get a excellent shave, great skin care and smooth shave at about 75% less cost. I rate this low because of the high cost and wasting your money on a razor that will be change within a year. You wives should spend about $30 on a excellent shaver and good skin care products and stop foolishly wasting money on gimmicks...that take your hard earned money. In this case stay with the time tested product. You can get the items I mention on Amazon.    "

I\'ve been using Mach-3 blades for a some time with mediocre results -- maybe because I haven\'t been shaving every day -- so I wanted to switch to something better and cheaper.  Atra blades are much less expensive than most other blades (e.g., Fusion), but it just doesn\'t work for me... and I think I may know why: my shaving technique sucks.The angle of the blade when shaving is very important.  The pivot point of the Atra is in the middle of the blade, which acts like a seesaw fulcrum: if you have the right pressure but a slightly wrong angle, the Atra will pivot to a more correct angle and shave well; if you have the wrong pressure but a good angle, it may result in irritation; and if both your pressure and angle are bad (like me), then it may result in irritation with nicks and cuts (and razor burn).Unlike the Atra, the pivot point of the Mach-3 is at the bottom of the blade: if the angle is wrong, then the Mach-3 will pivot to a better angle; if the pressure is a little too strong, the Mach-3\'s pivot will also correct for that; and if both the pressure and the angle are bad, then the Mach-3 may result in a good shave regardless of how much your shaving technique sucks.More blades may mean more irritation for people with sensitive skin, so Mach-3 is the highest I want to go.  If there is a (cheaper) two-blade razor with a bottom pivot, then I will try it.  I noticed similar irritation when I used the Sensor two-blade razor, and I think that the reason was due to the pivot point and my poor technique.  I really wanted to keep using the Atra because the price is much better, but it just didn\'t work for me.  If I ever learn good technique then I will start using a double-edge safety razor, but until then... it\'s Mach-3 for me.    "

It makes claims of important improvements on what I would have thought was unimprovable--after all it is just a razor with a new generation (it claims) of blades.So the question is this: is there a positive difference?I read the information that came with the razor and on the web and was impressed by Gillette\'s audacity (for instance, a circuit board to keep an even flow of juice to the vibrator motor even as the battery runs down, and special groves to feed whiskers into the onrushing blades as the user draws the Fusion Proglide across a cheek!).I figured to keep it simple: fresh blades in my current Fusion and in the Fusion Proglide, one for each cheek; four down strokes over gel shaving cream on the left cheek for the Fusion and four more on the right for the Fusion Proglide. Little did my familiy know that my morning routine had become a major evaluation activity.Well, there is a difference.

The only caveat I would note--and the reason for not giving it five stars--is that the product will stain wash cloths, sponges, poufs, etc. a blue color, sort of like liquid fabric softener does.

Finally tired of wearing an overnight level absorbancy pad and a tampon just to be on the safe side, I decided to find another option. I saw a package of Always Overnight Extra Heavy Flow Maxi pads at my local Wal-Mart, and I thought it wouldn\'t hurt to try them out. W-o-w. First of all, this is a VERY long pad. It is about the length of two Always Ultra-Thin Overnight pads stuck together, and it pretty much expands from the top of my underwear to the back of them. Another helpful feature is that this pad contains two sets of wings--one in the middle like traditional pads and another set at the back. While, these pads DEFINITELY prevent leaks, I have a few complaints about this product. First of all, I\'ve noticed that when you remove the pad, it leaves a thin adhesive strip on your underwear that is hard to remove. So, though these pads keep you from having accidents, I still do not recommend that you wear your good underwear while using them.  Also, it is pretty hard to descreetly carry these in your purse, as they are VERY large. But other than that, I feel that they are an amazing product. Surprisingly, these pads don\'t feel like a diaper when I am wearing them, so that is a plus. However, I feel that women who are any smaller than a size twelve or fourteen might find them to be quite bulky, so I would take that into consideration. Also, if you are a woman who is already sticking two maximum coverage pads together just to feel comfortable, this maxi pad has about the same effect, so it will not be anything new to you. But overall, I will purchase these in the future."

Gillette\'s is good at all that. I don\'t have sensitive skin, but I\'ve always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.Everything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream.

With this product, you get extra power; but you have to sacrifice some comfort and convenience to seal the bargain.First, let\'s get the obvious part out of the way: this stuff does a fine job of keeping you dry. In that regard it works as well as any antiperspirant I\'ve tried. Like other \'clinical strength\' products, the directions tell you to apply before bed at night, and explain how the product works by plugging up your pores so the sweat can\'t get out. I can\'t say that sounds too healthy to me, but after using a whole package, I didn\'t get a rash of any kind.Now, the sacrifices: in general, your underarm areas are going to feel weird. They\'ll feel tacky or rubbery to the touch, as though they\'re coated in dried rubber cement, especially for the first few hours after you\'ve applied the product. This might not bother everybody, but I didn\'t like the sensation.Finally, the elaborate packaging has a fatal flaw. You turn a little knob three clicks at a time to meter out the right dosage. The knob gives  satisfying loud click, and the packaging is strong and opaque. There\'s no squeezing or fooling around. But one day, you\'ll turn it one or two clicks and it will simply stop: the product will be all gone, but there will have been no warning. There\'s  just no way to tell when you\'re about to run out; this could leave you in an awkward position on the day of that big presentation...    "

The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.The comfort of the blade is by far the best I\'ve experienced. It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.The blade on the back I have found to be very useful which is something that, if I remember correctly, the Sensor doesn\'t even have.

The razors are materially more expensive than the Mach 3. It\'s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money. If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I\'d go with this one.2. The razors are thinner. I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.3. Amazon has great info and instructions. The razor itself does not. It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box. For example, I really wasn\'t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head.

I have been using Gillette sensor-series products almost exclusively since the Gillette sensor debuted in 1990.I graduated from Sensor, To Sensor II, to Mach 3, to Mach 3 power.I normally shave wet, with no shaving cream, and with down strokes, although I use some upstrokes. I have tested the Mach 5 both wet and dry, with no cuts or major problems.I have used the Gillette Fusion for 1 week, and here are my findings.Pluses:1) An overall great shave.2) The Fusion shaves better dry than any previous Sensor model. (Although I rarely have a reason to shave dry).3) More blades. More microfins!4) The plastic handle, while bulky, is very nice. The plastic is gentle to the touch, aa nice departure from the rigid, cold metal of the M3.5) Comes with a coupon for $2 off additional cartridges.Minuses:1) The confort strip wear out WAY too quickly.  My Mach3 blades last 3 weeks, My Fusion blade needs replacement after 1 week. Hopefully, the replacement blades will be better than the original ones (if so, I\'ll edit this review).2) Since there are more microfins with a larger area, and sincen the microfins become more imporant to the overall shave, the microfins trap more hairs than ever. Even washing the blade doesn\'t get rid of all of the microhairs trapped in the microfins.3) The 5 blades make upstrokes more difficult and don\'t offer the precision of the M3 and previous models for the tough spots (e.g. under the nose). On the soft ares of the face (e.g., the cheecks), the larger footprint makes it harder to press close and cut hairs close to the skin. However, this problem is somewhat offset by the additional blades and microfins.4) As always, the blades are more expensive than previous version. At this rate of inflation, Gillette blades will cost $50 each by the year 2030. =)Overall, it is a great product. I am undecided if I will keep using Fusion or switch back to the M3 as my primary. I might use both together (as I previously did with the M3 and Sensor Excel).    "

This, if it wasn\'t an oversight, struck me as kind of cheesy. I used the razor on my legs and underarms, without lather, and it did a good job and allowed me to retain my epidermis. I really don\'t know how long the lubricating action will last but I\'m sure it will continue to perform just as well with lather (I should add that my body hair is sparse and fine and doesn\'t dull a blade very fast).Speaking of cheesy, the oh-so-classy, \'sure you can spare it?\' holder-on-a-suction cup that\'s useless on a bathroom wall with very small tiles would have better been left on the drawing board.

For one, the marketing materials included in the package make no claim to any incremental benefit of using the vibrating razor function, only that it turns itself off after 7 minutes.  There are plenty of claims about the thinness of the blades, etc. but nothing about the power function.  In fact, it\'s distracting, and in some cases for me, interferes with the tactile nature of shaving.  Sometimes you need that feel when you\'re hunting for a few whiskers that escaped the first one or two passes.  You don\'t want to redo an area too many times, so you sense by feel where the patch is that needs extra attention.  This razor made me realize how tactile in nature blade shaving can be.As for the rest of the features, I\'m sure Gillette made some incremental improvements but I can\'t tell.  I do think the first shave out of the package was just marvelous.  If I were rich and spendthrift I would only use each blade once.    "

The battery just died on mine after 2 years and I couldn\'t be bothered to break out the soldering iron to replace it so I ordered a new \'handle\' for $62 shipped (toothbrush base minus the charger and brush tips.) I would skip 5000 with the Smartguide LCD and get the 4000 series instead. The LCD is a seriously useless gimmick IMO since the brush beeps every 30 seconds to let you know to move onto the next section. If you can live with expense ($40-45 a year) these brushes are great and, if it saves one costly dental procedure, it pays for itself."

There are two things that I have always loved about it.  First, it gives an incredibly close shave.  Other razors cut reasonably close, the using the Fusion there are times when I can run my hand across my face and not detect even the tiniest bit of beard.  Nothing but smoothness.  The other thing that I love about the razor is that I have cut myself using it less than any brand of razor than I have ever used.  One might think that five blades might actually increase the chances of getting cut, but this isn\'t the case.There have been several minor design changes over the past few years.  They have all, however, been rather minor.  Until now, that is.  The new Proglide version of the Fusion is considerably different than the other versions.  The main improvement is that blade now tilts back much more sharply, allowing you to shave at many more angles.  I find that this allows a much better shave than before, especially around the nose.  It is just easier to use than before.  The other major change is that there is a heavier lubricant strip.  Frankly, I\'m not a big believer in lubricant strips.  They don\'t seem to me to aid much in shaving.  But if you think this matters, it is definitely true that the lubricant strip is heavier than on the old blades.So, if you haven\'t used the Fusion series, I definitely recommend doing so.  It is a great razor.  And if you have been using the Fusion, I would definitely recommend the upgrade to the new Fusion Proglide.  It is a great improvement to an already great razor.    "

We really, really  like the smaller brush head which seems to  be able to clean teeth in  places that a longer, straight brush does not.  Our  older  straight brush seemed to coast  along the front while this brush gets into crevices.  Neither of us is sure that we\'ve ever had a problem because of brushing too hard.  Nonetheless, the warning light for that is a nice safety factor.  High on our  list of positives are the brush head indicator  bristles that let us  know when to change the brush head.  That\'s one thing that we\'ve been unsure of and procrastinated about in the past.  Sorry to say that our teeth don\'t appear to be any whiter so we continue to use the Crest strips."

I have sensitive skin and I\'m always complaining about not getting a close enough shave without tearing my face up, so when I saw the commercial for Proglide I decided to give it a go.  It\'s sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.  I\'ll say this, it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  When I\'ve waited a few days before using, the Proglide is a dream.  It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  Sadly, I\'ve noticed that if I shave two days in a row my skin gets irritated and the shave is nowhere near as close.  I know that some consider the battery operated vibration to be a mere gimmick, but having used a razor with the same capability for years I have found that my shave is always closer WITH the vibration, and I\'m quick to replace the battery because of that.  Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it\'s worth it (as far as I\'m concerned).  When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.  All in all, I like this product.  It delivers most of the time; I just wish it were always.    "

Those were the two top reasons why I purchased this product.  I knew I wanted to purchase an Oral-B.  I ordered the Oral-B 5000 Sunday 9-20, it was shipped 9-21 and I recieved it 9-25.  The order came from TeethNthings.  The product was packed ok but I received it banged up.  The postal worker wanted to blame it on poor packaging but it was packaged fine.  The product itself was fine.I have been using this product for a couple of days now so I must report that I am overall very happy and satisfied with it.  I read over the instructions twice, and when I used it for the first time, I was puzzled when I felt it doing small pauses.  The instructions are ok.  They could have broken it down dummy-style for some of us but oh well.  I was a bit confused about how to set the timing part, but I figured it out.  It could have been the excitement.If you buy this product, it will do these short pulses every two minutes.  After two minutes of brushing, the smiley comes up and winks.  So cute.  If you reach 4 minutes of brushing, it will do the pulse thing again.  There is a DVD that comes with it to explain their brushing technique of using the brush.  They break it down in 4 quadrants, 30 second intervals, two get in at least 2 minutes of brushing.The toothbrush itself is a tad bit noisier and heavier than my old ancient basic one, but let me tell you, boy does it go.  I feel like my teeth are getting a serious dental treatment, Spa Dente\'.  I don\'t know what this toothbrush will leave for the dentist to do, besides exrays.  To switch between the different brushing styles, you will push the triangle button while the brush is on.  The detached screen thing will tell you.  I use it in sensitive mode.  If you are brushing too hard, it will flash red.  Be careful not to push it while brushing, as it would seem easy to do.I really really love how they have the charger.  It is small and not bulky, which is perfect for travel.  Pretty smart how they did that.  The charger base is your travel base as well.  I really really love the blue travel case that it comes with so you can store two brush heads.  That is so neat.The best thing about this toothbrush is that it really gets your teeth, gums and mouth clean.  The smell of my breath has improved also.  It does a wonderful job.  I am very very pleased and would recommend this toothbrush to anyone.  It is a little expensive but it is well worth it to me.  I hope if you purchase this you will enjoy it as"

Then again, I\'m a daily shaver and my hair isn\'t so long after one day that it needs to be \'guided\' into the razor blade.  :)I do like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave.  I never get nicked or scratched when using a Fusion blade unless I\'ve been using it too long; the first nick is a sign that the blade is dull and needs to be replaced, which sometimes happens before the lubricating strip indicates a replacement is warranted.  I get about two week\'s worth of shaves out of each cartridge and don\'t do anything special to try to prolong their life.    "

I was at Target a few weeks ago looking for pads when I noticed that Always Infinity was on sale. Ever since they debuted I had basically avoided them like the plague because they\'re more expensive than Always Ultrathins with wings and I had a sneaking suspicion that the product was more hype than substance. But another customer saw me mulling the purchase over and insisted that I buy it. \'Oh, it holds a lot!\' she gushed (no pun intended). \'Trust me!\'Okay, so I did. I bought a box of \'heavy flow\' Infinity plus another box of Ultrathins for \'back up.\' And thank God I did! These pads have got to be the weirdest and most ineffectual maxis I have ever tried. When I first opened one up, I was horrified. First of all, the \'pad\' isn\'t at all like the cotton pad you would expect from a feminine napkin. The material is some kind of \'compressed material\', very similar in feel, flatness and texture to one of those oldskool white spongy Doctor Scholl\'s inserts. It even had the same type of holes in it (at the front of the pad). Making matters worse, there were some goofy markings in the back of the pad, making it look more like some futuristic landing strip at a spaceport than a maxi pad.And the entire thing was tiny. It was so small I had to double check to make sure which size pad I had gotten. But nope, this was indeed the heavy flow pad I was trying out.At any rate, I tried it out and holy frijoles, the adhesive was so weak, the wings couldn\'t attach properly. So I kept pressing them again and they flopped back out like they went, \'OH, NO SHE DIDN\'T! SHE DID NOT TRY STICKING US TO HER UNDERWEAR!\' By this point, my patience was wearing thin, but I had a box of these and was determined to try them out. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Within an hour I could see that flow was leaking/ rolling past the perimeters of the pad. I decided not to chance the pads as my period went into its heavy flow stage and went with my regular Ultrathin Overnights. Then when my flow went light again, I tried the Infinity again for one night. Woke up the next morning and saw that after pooling in the middle, the very little flow I\'d had hopped, skipped, and rolled past the futuristic spaceport landing strip markings in the back of the pad and then found its \'happy place\' in the back of my underwear. Nice.Needless to say, I wasn\'t happy with these  and will still keep using Ultrathins. There\'s one plus side-- if I experience shoe pain in the future and there are no Dr. Scholl\'s inserts to be had, I can use these instead."

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist\'s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn\'t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn\'t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don\'t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn\'t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth."

Plus, it actually gets stuck shaving against the grain.I\'m serious, it stops moving and you have to put more pressure on it, bear down harder, to get it to move which, of course, results in those extra cuts and irritation, and then it still misses patches of beard you just tried to shave.This is just a waste of money.  The technology behind this is only different, not better.  No doubt it\'s the 5 blade foolishness that makes it stop moving in rougher sections of the beard, and the power blade vibration seems to accomplish nothing at all.I\'m convinced that the rave reviews here are from people new to shaving, people who have light beards, or people getting paid to promote the product.

It had 5 blades, a surrounding cushion, a grippy handle, and it shaves beautifully.  I can\'t complain.  However, I\'ve been using a Venus for several years -- one with 3 blades -- and *it* shaves beautifully too.  The last time I shaved, I used both razors, one at a time of course, to see which performed better.  I really saw/felt no difference between the two.  The Embrace\'s 5 blades are smaller in width than the other razor\'s 3 blades.  The head of the Embrace is larger, supposedly to offer more cushioning.  But the difference between the two razors\' ability to shave really isn\'t noticable!  They both did a fine job!  So if you have an older-style Venus, you might as well keep using it.  No need to upgrade if you like the razor you already have.  And for those of you who haven\'t tried Venus razors, they allow you to give your legs safe, smooth shave.  I would recommend this product if you don\'t already have a razor you like.Edit: After several months of use, I can warn you... never leave this razor face-down on any surface (countertop, edge of bathtub, etc.)  The material surrounding the blade will stick to that surface and, when you try to pick up the razor, the material will rip like paper and leave a residue on the countertop or wherever (it can be removed, but it\'s sort of annoying.)

I have a tough beard and sensitive skin. A bad combination. I bought the Fusion on a whim. I didn\'t expect it to be signficantly better than the previous generation Mach 3 but hope springs eternal. After two weeks and 7-8 shaves with the same cartridge(!), I can wholeheartedly say that this is a very noticeable improvement over the Mach 3. The cartridges have an astounding life. The Mach 3 would give me about 3-4 shaves before the blades dulled enough to result in razor rash. The Fusion has at least doubled that and is still going strong. Amazing. The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if Gillette is using a higher quality steel in the blades for the product launch. Time will tell. Secondly, I get far less razor burn from the Fusion. Almost none actually. Lastly, it\'s more difficult to cut myself in the nose/lip area which was something I had to watch carefully with the Mach 3. I\'d guess this has to do with a larger blade surface area. In short, the Fusion really is an improvement over the Mach 3. As long as the cartridges continue to last for 8-10 shaves each, I will be a loyal customer.    "

Tip, if you want it to last 5 years or more, remove it and clean it soon after making your coffee, at the latest, when you have finished all the coffee in the carafe.  DO NOT bang it against anything to remove the old grind and DO NOT leave the hot soggy grind in the filter for any length of time, and NO dishwasher!  To prevent the oil build-up on the mesh, simply rinse with cool water outside-in ASAP, and place upside down in natural lit area so as to prevent mold.

Low and behold, it\'s a feature designed to let you know it\'s time to move on to another part of your mouth...very nice.The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.  The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  I have found the button placement may not be located at the best spot for some people.  While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  The brush is thinner than other brushes I have used.  I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  Also, the brush head is much smaller with fewer frills than other sonic brushes I have tried.Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.

I used the clickable coupon that was available on Amazon and I think I ended up paying less than $15 for the item because I\'m also a Prime member. The item arrived 2 days later and I was trimming away. I actually enjoyed using the product. It looks and feels like a quality shaver and trimmer. I also like that it is powered by batteries because I use rechargeable batteries. I actually haven\'t used the shaving part of the unit because I really hate shaving. I was able to trim my beard on my neck so closely that it shaving wasn\'t really necessary. Still I\'m impressed with how the razor attaches and vibrates. I\'m sure I\'ll use it eventually, even if just out of curiosity, lol. Love this purchase.    "

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It\'s kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

I\'ve progressed over the years from an electric razor to progressively a one blade, two blade, three blade, and now a five blade gillette - battery powered and otherwise. Have I ever noticed a major difference moving one to the next - not sure - but like many others of you I tend to buy the latest just to say that I have it.Shaving differences well truth be told the biggest revelation for me was when I switched from electric to the one blade gillette - I\'d used the electric for twenty years since the time when I had to shave in the first place. What a revelation! The electric took for ever and seemed to grind your beard down much like a power sander. By contrast the one blade hand gillette was quick clean and gave you the impression that you\'d actually had a shave in the first place.Since then I suppose I have detected minor improvements as I\'ve progressed from one blade to two and more etc. But the changes are only apparent initially and you soon just don\'t notice, and they are sure not as marked as the transition from electric to manual. It\'s a bit like the difference between an expensive bottle of wine and a slightly cheaper one, or a good hi fi system and a not quite so good hi fi system - the differences are suttle - but there sure must be a big difference between a one blade and a five blade gillette. The only \'primitive\' razor I\'ve tried recently is a disposable and it is sure streets ahead of that.Aside from the disposable I\'ve never gone back to a lesser (ie fewer blades) gillette to test the extent of the improvement - perhaps I should. Anyway it\'s a good, well presented, piece of marketing - and as I said like many of you I\'d rather have the five blade than many that went before.Oh and by the way I don\'t cut myself with the five blader as I have with previous fewer bladed models so there is something tangible! Perhaps that is a good pointer to a better razor.    "

The review by Cherise Everhard nails it.LONG VERSION: Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty must be reclining comfortably in her mansion in the Pantheon subdivision on Mount Olympus, counting the revenue from her licensing deal with Gillette. The sale of the razor blades alone must be quite profitable, allowing her to fill her closets with designer togas.This is one of those products that get written about in marketing studies. Where the basic item, a computer printer, for example, has a reasonable retail price but the ink refills are the longterm profit center. In this case, the razor is quite a good value, the price of the razor blades, however, leave you breathless!I myself was seduced by the allure of Venus when a women\'s magazine named the Venus Embrace Razor one of the beauty innovations of the year. (Yes, I read women\'s magazines! So what? This is a women\'s product! If you are a guy reading this review, you can just take off your judgemental hat and go back to watching the droning ball game on the sofa where you usually repose. Relax, have a beer!)Not being able to purchase Mach 2 razor blades anywhere for any price was causing me upset. I had a perfectly good razor that was totally useless. I bought a Soleil. It was French. It was pink-orange and white like a creamsicle. It was curved like a dolphin. It had three blades which was one more than the Mach 2 had. I was unimpressed.So, there I was, with a three bladed razor thinking that this was not nearly enough.Listen, hair removal is a tricky business. There are multiple solutions to the problem, some very, very bad and some very, very good. With chemotherapy and radiation being the very worst solutions, the best solution, in my admittedly fairly limited experience, is waxing. Unfortunately there are times when waxing is inconvenient. Like 10 minutes before you are planning to leave for the beach and you feel some stubble on your ankles. This is when you really need a razor.So I read about the Venus Embrace being an innovation of the year and I was hooked.What you get when you buy the \'starter kit\' is:- A pretty, ergonomically curved razor that has \'attractive sea foam green and turquoise\' (purple and teal) colored gel inserts on the handle. These cause a squishy/sticky feel that is not unpleasant but somewhat odd.... like holding a silicone spatula or a dog toy. The manufacturer claims that these gel inserts cause the razor handle to sit more firmly in the hand and not to slip.-The blade. The \'business end\' of the razor is HUGE! Its an oval shaped disk that contains five \'spring mounted\' blades that are surrounded by wide areas of plastic covered by variously colored slippery coatings that the manufacturer describes as \' Protective Ribbon of Moisture\'.-An extra razor cartride which comes packed in a clever, water-proof, sealed plastic container.-A plastic \'Shower Pod\' which is a small holder for the razor and extra blades that is supposed to attach to the bathroom tile with a suction cup.The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is the sticky/squishy feel of the razor handle. The blade cartridge sits safely in its sealed plastic container and is easily inserted on to the handle.The blade is sized perhaps for true Olympians like Venus Williams rather than mere mortal-sized women such as I. Did I mention is is HUGE? Paul Bunyon huge. Yo, Venus! Did you actually approve the size of this cartridge? I bet not.The shower pod is a tacky plastic thing that would not stay suctioned to my tile wall. It went directly into the trash.Although the razor head pivots, the blades are \'spring loaded\', there are moisture strips, and the handle is curved and tricked out with gel inserts, the Venus Embrace razor is unwieldy. It just doesn\'t go where you want it to go when you want it to go there. And when it goes there you don\'t really get such a close shave. I don\'t notice any better shaving than with my old Mach 2.What I have noticed about the Venus Embrace is that I have not cut myself once and I have not experienced razor burn. These were not significant problems with my Mach 2 but I thought I should mention them.My fundamental saddness with this product arrived when I needed to purchase additional blades and sticker shock set in. Three buckeroos a cartridge makes one think once or twice about continuing to use this razor. Sorry Goddess Venus, but that\'s one Sister\'s opinion.    "

I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand?

The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.In particular, note that the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per second, and does not have a battery charging indicator. All of which are present just one level up in the Professional Care 1000.To me the lack of a quadrant timer is a big disappointment - I don\'t want to be watching a clock while brushing if I don\'t  have to. The gentle thrumming of the Professional Care 1000 every 30 seconds is a very nice pacer.The brushes in the Professional Care series not only add quadrant timers, but also are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second, and have battery charge indicators.As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.Overall, I found the Vitality to be lacking features that I rely on. Hence my rating. I\'d strongly recommend that you consider the Professional Care 1000 as the minimum entry level functionality for a brush. You\'ll probably find (like I did) that you don\'t need much more than what the Professional Care 1000 has to offer.Happy Brushing!~Damodar"

I have tried--and rejected--several different Schick razors over the years simply because they were uncomfortable and left me feeling as though I had just shaved with broken glass using battery acid for shaving cream. I always went back to my Mach 3, then Fusion and was pleasantly surprised to see that the Fusion was being re-tooled to be even better.No matter HOW great my shaves have been using Gillette products, invariably I wince each & every time I go into a store to purchase replacement blades. Damn, but they\'re expensive! For some stupid reason, the times when I need a new razor the most seem to be at the moments when I can afford it the least. Weird, but a painful & expensive fact nevertheless.I swore off using Schick products shortly after the release of the Quattro model several years ago. I borrowed my brother-in-law\'s once and on a brand new blade, got a MUCH worse shave than I did using my 1 month old--not to mention rather dull and oft-used Gillette Mach 3 razor. After that I simply gave up even considering purchasing Schick products EVER again. I have always stuck with Gillette since--however, in all fairness I have discovered a 6 bladed razor that I have only found at Walgreens which shaves JUST AS GOOD as my Fusion--not to mention are cheaper (by at least $3 per refill), and would often stick with that in the last year or so when money has been tight.I finally saved up and purchased a Proglide razor recently and found the shave to be pretty much as expected. But as I began to take stock in all the models I have used over the years, I found something interesting...and I went and tested my theory to see if I was imagining it all--and nope, I was right on the money. The simple fact of the matter is this: all things considered, the Mach 3 razor shaves I would say about 98% as close as the Fusion 5 blade razor...and I aslo discovered that the Proglide does not shave ANY closer than the original Fusion. NONE. Considering how freakin\' expensive Gillette products are, and especially how much more they charge for the Proglide than the Fusion, I\'m sorry, but I would expect if the product cost 35% MORE, that the razor would actually perform 35% better, too. Not so. And when I factor in that the much cheaper Mach 3 shaves essentially as close as the other two MUCH more expensive razors, well I think you can figure out where I am going with this...I also discovered quite by accident, that Consumer Reports did their own independant testing and came up with the EXACT SAME results. Interesting, huh?I have one additional thing to add: through the amazon Vine program I received a Schick Hydro 5 razor back in early August. I only ordered it because I figured as long as I would be getting it for free, then at least if I did not like it, I could throw it away and not feel as though I had wasted any money. I was exceptionally surprised when after my first shave I had decided that I would go out and purchase a replacement cartridge right away. Yes, it was THAT good. From what I have noticed having used it now for over 2 months (still on the first original blade, too) is that the Hydro blades stay sharper MUCH longer than ANY previous Gillette product I have used in the past. Imagine my surprise when I went to purchase a replacement 4pack cartridge and discovered it was just under $5 cheaper than the regular Fusion 4pack and nearly $7 cheaper than the Proglides. In fact, it was about the exact same price as what I was paying for Mach 3 cartridges some 5 YEARS ago. Cheaper razors that last longer and still give me a top notch razor-burn-free shave adds up to one very converted former Gillette fanboy.To sum it up: did the Proglide shave great? YES. In fact it was a superior shave all around. Would I recommend buying one? Well, that depends. Personally I doubt I\'ll pay for another Proglide razor ever again. I simply cannot justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper. Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...but I found that for ME, the opposite was true. While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process. Either way, if you have the money, buy what works for YOU and don\'t let anybody tell you different.    "

I have always been a Gillette Razor user since I started to shave over 25 years ago. I have sensitive skin on my face and neck so shaving is a difficult process for me. My job prohibits beards so I need to shave every 2 days. With razors I have used in the past, with a 2 day growth,  my beard wasn\'t long enough to soften the stubble so it\'s like shaving sand paper. This always resulted in razor burns, nicks and cuts. Sometimes I looked like a victim of a masacre. My last razor was the Mach 3 Turbo. Very good razor but still got some nicks and cuts. Then I saw the commercial for the Fusion razor with 5 blades. My first thought was \'gimmick\' It will be just like any other razor, so I was reluctant to buy it. Eventually after seeing the commercials over and over again they stated with 5 blades there is less friction on your face and it will reduce problems, I broke down and bought one- the power version. The first time I used it I had\'nt shaved for a few days so I had pretty thick growth. The razor was incredible. It hugs your face like no other razor I have ever used. Even on the curves. It feels like it\'s sticking to your skin. When I was finished, not one nick or cut, and no burning sensation. It was the closest shave I ever got. My face felt as smooth as silk. The real test would be 2 days later with a minimal beard growth. That\'s where most of my problems occur. So here I was looking in the mirror with shaving cream on my face and the razor in my hand. I turned it on and went to work. To my surprise and delight it performed with flying colors. No nicks, cuts or burns!! At last a razor that lives up to the hype! I am sold and will use it until Gillette comes out with a 10 blade version! hehehe. Please remember, everybody\'s face, skin, and beard texture is different so you may not get the same results as I did. The blades are very expensive but last a little longer than the Mach 3 blades. However for the shave I got, I\'ll pay it. The one thing that takes a little getting used to is the single blade up on top. Great for shaving  under your nose or marking a sideburn line but takes some practice to use it. I cut the bottom of my nose with it the first time but have gotten the hang of it. All I can say is give this razor a try. If you don\'t like it you can always go back to your old one.    "

Ironically, the Fusion is particularly bad at the two things it is advertised as being particularly good at: close, comfortable shaving, and shaving hard-to-reach places.The blades are terrible.  Right out of the box, the blades caught on my beard and made it painful to shave.  It felt as if the razor was very dull.  I switched blades after two shaves and the replacement was just as bad.  Comparitively, the Mach 3 blades feel great for as many as 10 uses for me.  Not comfortable at all, and because of the pain, I couldn\'t shave as close.As for using this razor to shave hard to reach areas, they must be kidding!  Compare the size of the Mach 3 with the Fusion.  If the Mach 3 is a tight-cornering sports car, the Fusion is a school bus.  To accomodate the five blades the razor pad is so large it\'s difficult to share accurately. And the \'trim\' blade on the back is simply dangerous - the placement makes it much more likely to cut your fiinger, but the plastic on either end of the blade itself makes it unlikely to shave your beard.Not worth the money.

Great product!I\'ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in it\'s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I\'ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don\'t know what they\'re talking about. I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down. Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.Don\'t hesitate to purchase a Pulsonic. But shop around for replacement heads. I found there\'s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive. However, this Pulsonic has two speeds, and she has found the slower speed to be perfect for her.Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he\'s happy with it too.

So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.  Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave.  However, both razors seemed to give the same shave in terms of closeness.  To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days and there was no appreciable difference.I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.  The battery power works in the shower, so that\'s a nice convenience.  Naturally, with a battery, there\'s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3.  Since my old razor never bothered me, I won\'t be switching to these more expensive blades.  But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.    "

And after owning it for a month or two now, it\'s definately a good trimmer to be battery powered, but not great as it is advertised.  First I\'ll list the pros...ProsGreat for shaving-With the fusion proglide heads, this razor is awesome.  It has the same quality, but better since it has the higher quality handle.  I threw away my old proglide handle in favor of this sleeker and more efficent design.  As far as the face shaving aspect of this product, it\'s excellent.Great for trimming your facial hair-Another aspect where the Styler is excellent.  I\'ve used it to trim my goatee and sideburns quite a few times, and it gives an even and effective trim.  Plus, it\'s the original reason I bought the Styler, since my Phillips Norelco beard trimmer cut and trimmed my facial hair unevenly.  With this though, trimming is very fast and simple.  I also like how the trimmer comes with three length combs, making it easy when I decide to grow a beard and blend my goatee with interchangable trimmer combs.  When trimming my goatee, I used the 3 guide comb, which is perfect for trimming the length on shaggy hair without completely oblitterating my goatee.  Then, when I wanna grow my beard out, I used the 1 guide comb to blend my goatee in with my stubble.The razor comes complete with a stand to hold everything-I couldn\'t believe for $20, I got a razor/trimmer/attachment combs/tray.  The tray that comes inside the packaging means your bathroom will be more organized than using traditional razors or trimmers.  It\'s also smart the way the tray has 3 openings in the back for each guide comb and one opening in the top for the fusion head attachment to rest in.  And the fusion attachment head is built efficently, since it has an attachment that fits neatly on top of the trimmer head.  It also looks cooler and makes storage easy and effective.Now onto the cons...ConsNot great for lining facial hair-While this trimmer is perfect for trimming facial hair and shaving, it\'s not great at lining a beard, sideburns or goatee.  This actually surprized me, since the Gillette campaign in the advertisements claims it\'s great for lining and detailing.  Specifically showing in the commercials how supposedly great it is in detailing and lining facial hair.  In that department, it\'s a bit of a disappointment, but I\'ve never found any cartridge razor that can line as well as a disposable razor, and this is no exception.  And as far as the edger is concerned, the few times I\'ve tried lining with it, it never did a phenominal job, more like mediocre at best, since in most instances I wound up using a disposable razor to correct it.Doesn\'t have a long battery life-Not really too surprizing here, since I\'m kind of OCD when it comes to keeping my facial hair looking neat.  Plus, I have used it more often than just on my face, thus a partial reason why the battery isn\'t lasting very long.  I\'d say the average battery life of the Styler would be a month if not used for body hair or any other non facial detailing purpose.  Since it\'s so efficent though, this isn\'t a major issue for me.  Others might see it that way however, since batteries are kind of costly to replace.Not great for use on body hair or lining the back of your neck-I really don\'t consider these two areas major issues, since the Styler is only intended for face use anyway.  I feel though that I must point out for those who think this might be great for trimming body hair or good for lining your neck in between barber visits, this isn\'t the tool for either purpose.  With this being a battery controlled trimmer, it\'d take you forever to use on body hair.  Plus, to me using something on your body hair that\'s intended for your face is kind of cross contaminating anyway.  I initially thought I might be able to use this for lining my neck hair in between trims, but this won\'t leave an even cut or line.  Something my old beard trimmer could do, but again not a big deal to me, since this product is for facial shaving and maintenance.Overall, I rate this 4 out of 5 stars since it\'s great at shaving and trimming facial hair.  Really, for about $20 bucks, this Styler is a quality invcstment for any guy.  It can do most things a beard trimmer can at half the cost(not counting the cheapo pieces of crap trimmers).  I wish this thing was rechargable, then it would be darn near perfect.  If you\'re expecting to be using this for any other purpose than facial hair, you might want to invest in a good body hair trimmer or hair clipper set instead.  Otherwise though, I have been happy with this purchase and would buy another set once it needed replacing.    "

Since my return home at the end of 2007, I\'ve been getting a month\'s use per blade on both my face and scalp. I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but, what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long? On the 1st of each month, I replace the old blade with a fresh one. The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months....

I have however tried cheaper versions, including crest and cheaper Oral-B\'s. This one is by far the best out of the different toothbrushes I\'ve tried! Firstly, it isn\'t dependent on batteries; it\'s rechargeable, which is great, so you dont have to spend money buying batteries every few weeks. Secondly, this model can be used with a few different brush attachments. the floss action is nice because it has a small head, which makes it easier to get to the hard to reach back molars. If it\'s too small for you, you can always use one of the bigger head attachments (not sure which ones go with this model, but I\'m sure you can find out on the Oral B website or somewhere here on Amazon). This leaves my teeth cleaner than any brush I\'ve used. They feel as clean as if I had just come from the dentist! The battery life is great too! It will last me two weeks with 2x a day brushing before I have to charge it.

I\'m a 5-6 day a week shaver, so pretty regular. And I will also say I H-A-T-E shaving. Man\'s face was never meant to have a sharp object ran across it to take hair off. That\'s what I believe.For all the talk of these razors having a smooth shave, I\'m not that impressed. It feels different than the Mach 3s I\'ve been using since the late 90s, when they came out. Probably because it\'s a wider surface moving across my face. The features of my facial hair are: Relatively fine, not thick, but tough. And along my neck the hair grows in at least 3 different directions making shaving that much more frustrating. I will also add there is a spot along the left side of my larger than average chin that consistently gets missed. I must run the blade over it at least 3 times, and by that third time, my face has had enough and is quite irritated. I don\'t believe I had that problem with the Mach 3s.I posted a comparison shot of this razor (they are placed upside down relative to the camera, too). The one on the left is after 3 uses. The right has not been used. Notice the glide strip appearing on the bottom-it\'s half gone! I don\'t know if the metal will last the weeks I\'ve been reading about, but that strip isn\'t going to! I don\'t anticipate having a anything near a smooth shave if I let those blades touch my face a few more times, not based on my years of experience.AND...I must also note that I have well water that is VERY hard. You can see the calcium build-up on the sides. I believe that probably shortens the life of any razor.I don\'t doubt the guys who say they have gotten good use from this blade. I haven\'t, and likely won\'t, so I will eat the 10 bucks I spent and go back to my Mach 3s.    "

They initially entered the market using very different technologies: ultrasonic vibration for Sonicare, rotary brushes for Oral-B.Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces. They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task. The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges. At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B\'s rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.Sonicare\'s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system. The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled. These brushes are sold under the FlexCare moniker.After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare. I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare\'s. I don\'t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied. This may actually be a good thing since you\'re supposed to only apply it gently.Oral-B includes a feature similar to what Sonicare calls the \'quad-pacer,\' essentially a timer that signals you when it\'s time to switch quadrants (every 30 seconds)Battery life is about a week.Included in the package: brush, charging stand, bonus interstitial brush... but no travel case.PROS----- a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets- very low price for this technology- easy to clean- small charging stand- small brush, great for little hands- quad pacer- setting for sensitive gumsCONS----- may be too small for some hands- charger is 110V only (you need a transformer, not just an adapter, to use it overseas)- no travel caseCONCLUSION----------Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes. At less than half the price of the cheapest FlexCare, the Pulsonic is worthy of your consideration. Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don\'t move the brush back and forth, don\'t push hard: just hold it in place and let it do its job. You will get the best results if you rinse with Listerine and floss before brushing."

For shaving the back of the head, the balance of the razor is awkward at best.  For shaving the rest of the head, it was no better then any other good blade.For shaving the face, the balance was good, but that was about it.  There was no difference in irritation between the two blades.  The lubricating strip faded to white after about four shaves, meaning you are no longer getting what Gillette calls an \'optimal shaving experience.\'I tried to trim the chin area between my fumanchu moustache. It did a horrible job, no matter how careful I was and the area was left feeling extremely irritated.Consider the Mach 3 over this razor.

I saw the item locally so I purchased it with the intention of shaving with it first thing in the morning.  I am currently a Mach 3 user and I love it so I wondered if this Fusion thing would make a big difference.  I honestly feel that the shave with the Fusion is of the same closeness at the Mach 3.  However the Fusion has a HUGE bonus the extra blade (six) on the back of the shaving headto hit those stray hairs that remain under the nose that the Mach 3 normally misses.  Also it is much easier to trim sideburns with the Fusion because you do not have to worry about hacking off a huge chunk with the mass of 3 blades with the Mach 3.  A bit pricey and if the razor came at the same price as the Mach 3 I would commit to the upgrade, (Very Hard for guys to change hygeine products, we love the good old reliables).  If you do not have a Mach 3 then I recommend purchasing the Fusion.  Bottom line: Close shave, nice sideburn and stray hair trimmer, nice overall design of the handle, and a good looking razor.

The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I\'d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a \'recognized name\' in oral hygiene (for whatever that\'s worth), and it\'s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).Since I don\'t have firsthand experience with other moto-brushes, I can\'t write a comparative review, but I CAN comment on this product\'s effectiveness in comparison with regular brushes, and that comparison is altogether favorable. Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before. This model features a two-minute timer, which is helpful. It\'s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well (I use it twice a day, and only need to charge it about once every eight days).Oral-b manufactures a variety of different heads for the Vitality line, and though I\'ve not tested the different varieties to see if they have markedly different results, I like the fact that the product is so well-supported; it means I probably won\'t soon find myself owning an obsolete brush for which I can\'t get replacement heads. The heads are sturdy, too, lasting me about three weeks or a month each.Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn\'t do things I don\'t need it to, doesn\'t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support.

I personally use the Venus Spa Breeze and loved when it first came out  a few years later and the novelty has worn off.  I find that they are not shaving as well as they used to and the \'bar\' on the actual razor head is not providing any sort of lubrication when it comes to shaving.Now onto the Pro Skin!  These come with a nifty little shower hook that suction cups to my tiled wall rather well.  What happened to the hard snap case that holds the razor in the front and brand new cartridges inside??  This was a big disappointment.  Where am I supposed to store the cartridges?  I hate when I have to separate things because I end up finding unused cartridges of a brand that I am no longer using and disposed of the handle a long time ago (HELLO INTIUTION).  After my initial disappointment and annoyance of that change I vowed to keep an open mind.  The shaving went great!  I found my legs feeling way smoother than they have in a couple of years.  The \'Moisturerich\' head really seems to work.  For me it did not drip or ooze  I think that may be a factor of how much water you are using and how long you are shaving.  My one complaint is that it doesn\'t do as well in the bikini area or around my knees because of the bar  but that is to be expected with this type of shaver.Highly recommend but wish that companies would stop skimping and charging more.  My husband actually commented on the smoothness & suppleness of my legs the very next day when he bumped my calf.  This lead to stroking my whole leg  at the time it didn\'t click that it was actually the Pro Skin razor.  I think I may replace my Spa Breeze with the Pro because at the end of the day I like my legs to feel as if they have been moisturized with lotion.

Could the Fusion be that much better than the Mach 3?  Was it worth spending $10 on?  In short answer YES!!!The FUSION follows every curve on your face like an Ariel Atom sticks to every curve and corner on the race track....The MACH 3 on the other hand feels live a Ford Festiva going around your face on 4 donut spare tires.Where the MACH 3 leaves short hairs for the 2nd pass the FUSION annihilates them in 1 pass.Where the MACH 3 lets your face feel like you need to shave again right after your done the Fusion turns your face into a smooth sheet of glass.My last point is that you need to invest in the Fusion cream (or some high end cream). This is the biggest problem  people skimp on the cream and don\'t get the best results.

Just got off the phone with Amazon no problem getting refund and getting free shipping label to send back. Yet will never buy razor blades from any store online again. Dont have the time to do the research if they are knock offs or no I just know from my experience with the ones from Amazon that they are way to sharp and cut up my neck and face even though I first wet my face with hot water then wait a couple minutes for shaving cream to settle into skin and shave the exact way I always do which never caused cuts with the blades I buy locally. Who knows whats up I will stick to buying my razor blades from the local retailers.Update: I contacted Amazon about this product. I hate to do this but because these are fakes I told them they will be shipped to Proctor and Gamble\'s counterfeit department for inspection. The reason I am doing this is because first of all the fake blades I received give a painful shave and I just cant allow fellow buyers to be deceived the way I was. So hopefully Amazon will either sell real ones or Procter and Gamble will peruse legal action. The bottom line is buyers like myself would gladly pay the couple extra dollars you would at Wal Mart rather then be deceived and being sold fake blades. And yes Amazon did refund my money but the procedure when you receive a counterfeit product is not to return it to the merchant first you should contact the company who makes the actual product then local and state attorney departments and the better business beuero. If I wanted fake razor blades I would have purchased them off of Ebay. Grow up Amazon and quit trying to trick people!!

These are made from what I can only describe as a \'Dr. Scholl\'s-like\' material.  The pad is VERY comfortable and definitely breathes.  If you\'re an active female, or have an extremely heavy flow, then you should definitely be conscious of having to change out the pad throughout the day.  These Infinity pads are SUPER absorbent - what\'s seen on the surface of the pad is only about 1/3 of what\'s actually being held.  So please keep that in mind.  I normally have a heavy flow and sometimes had issues at night (I sleep on my belly) and that was always a big problem during \'my time\' when the pad I\'d use would leak.  Not at all the case with these!Always Infinity DOES tend to cost more than other brands, but if you keep an eye out (as I do) you can find a decent in-store sale.

The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.    "

It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It\'s now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it\'s thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers   so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can\'t be improved.  It\'s just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  I brush twice a day, on and off with Seonsodyne Whitenting and Sensodyne Pronamel. I also ensured that I used the \'Whitening\' brush setting that the toothbrush offers. Between the two photos, I noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not very much.  My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  So I\'d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  It would probably be nice to have it your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don\'t expect too much.  It might be somewhat of a gimmick that it \'whitens\' teeth, but if you look at what the item is called--Pro White, it is designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth and make them a little whiter.  SO in all fairness, I\'d say that it works as it should without huge results that people may expect of it."

The next size head down is a 40.The texture is SOFT, not Medium texture, and you should optfor the SOFT, rather than the Medium; the SOFT (this one) isplently firm to do the job without mushing down and wastingyour time just going through the motions without connecting.Looking at the bristles head-on (staring at the tips of thetufts, with the plastic head in the rear), the arrangementof the tufts (the pattern) is an oval. Normally I personallydo not like such an arrangement, preferring instead a solidrectangle, so as to purchase more surface area with which toconnect to the teeth and gums. In the case of the CrossAction(manual) toothbrush\'s configuration, the lack of \'corners\' tothe brush is not noticeable, unlike other oval-shaped heads.Reason for this is two-fold (am not a tech, this is personalconjecture or observation): the outer \'rim\' or border of thebrush\'s bristles is resilient (doesn\'t give easily, no mush),AND the very tip of the brush head has a special arrangementof slightly LONGER bristles (color: solid white, no bluishindicator layer) that reach v-e-r-y effectively into netherregions of the mouth (back molars?) to route out the bugs &leftover food particles. All you need is SOFT, not Medium;should you utilize a Medium (texture rating, not size) one,you\'d gouge your gums and whatever else is in there. You\'llget enough traction and friction and devil-exorcising actionwith a SOFT CrossAction (manual) toothbrush.Do not confuse the CrossAction with the Advantage series ofOral-B manual toothbrushes; although the Advantage line hasa similar appearance (shape and combination of features), Iventure to tout the CrossAction as being superior in termsof achieving results (getting one\'s teeth and gumline cleanin the least amount of time, with the minimum of dexterity).In case you DO wish to order a single Advantage toothbrushin the same order (to compare the two brushes), go to theSearch box and either type or copy/paste the Amazon ID# forthat style, which is ASIN: B0000C4KJG.

The squeaky-clean satifaction will SPOILyou, and you won\'t settle for a manual toothbrush of lesserquality in the future.This brush does not include the rubber bristles along theouter edge of similar toothbrushes: they are supposed tomassage your gums, but IMHO the regular CrossAction doesenough work on both the teeth and also the gumline to actas a do-it-all toothbrush (no, it does not floss!).BTW, your dentist probably never has mentioned during allthe precious moments that you have spent together THAT THEGUMS ACT AS AN O-RING GASKET SEAL between your teeth andthe jaw-bones. Maintaining the gums (such as with a brush)preserves the GUMS, which in turn will protect your teethROOTS and jawBONES from bacteria and foreign matter. Youneglect your gums when in your prime, and you\'ll reap amess of AVOIDABLE trouble with your roots and bones later.Perhaps you might even suggest to your dentist that s/hebe more proactive in making patients AWARE of the role ofthe (silent) g-u-m-s in protecting the base of out teeth!Parting comment: sugar rots teeth, but the bone particleswithIN refined sugar are the #1 cause of various cancers.This according to avatar Sathya Sai Baba, who should know."

I always found that women\'s razors worked better for this area because men\'s razors are meant for the face (I use the Gillette Fusion for this every other day activity) and have tried quite a bit since I started with this habit back in 2002/2003.  Like with the men\'s razors the products keep getting better with time and the Venus Spa Breeze is no exception.  With this latest incarnation the soap has been attached to the blades and a nice scent has been added as upgrades.  The old Venus blades always worked great but this upgrade is definitely a worthwhile one.  The pros are that the soap produced makes for a smoother shave and more clean and the smell really is nice.  The cons are that I would imagine these new blades are much more $$$ than the old Venus razors with regular cream and the soap attached doesn\'t allow you the same kind of control that you had before.If you like not having to lather up and don\'t mind spending the extra money this is a fine product.  If you want to save some cash and just use lather + the standard Venus product you can\'t go wrong there either.  Gillette makes the best razors around and I don\'t think they will be losing the shaving title any time soon.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Overall, we are both very satisfied with this product.Product Details and background for my review--------------------------------------------I have owned Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  I have owned a previous generation of Oral-B electric brush some years ago and found the build quality was poor when compared to Sonicare. Sonicare employs a rapid vibration of the brush head to generate sonic waves which dislodge plaque from teeth.  The Oral-B brush has a small, round head that rotates back and forth (It does not do full rotations.  If I had to guess about how much it rotates before it switches directions, I would guess somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees).  The package says that in clinical studies it improves gum health better than Sonicare advance.  I cannot provide feedback on this as I have not been to the dentist since I have been using the Oral-B and even if I had been, the results of that visit would not be guaranteed to be related to the brush itself.THE GOOD--------This toothbrush is very well constructed.  This new model has excellent build quality throughout.My teeth feel smoother after using the Oral-B than after using my Sonicare.  I thought I was imagining it and didn\'t mention it to my wife but when she approached me telling me her teeth feel cleaner and smoother, I was convinced that the mechanical performance of the brush was better at cleaning the teeth.  So far the battery performance is very good but it is a new brush so I expect it to be so.  It has a pacing mode similar to Sonicare\'s in that it gives the user feedback every 30 seconds (the brush head stops moving momentarily.  Sonicare beeps in this case, but I don\'t think this is a plus or minus for either brush).  I did like that the Oral-B will let you go beyond the 2 minutes (30 seconds for each quadrant of the mouth).  The Sonicare makes you start it again as it shuts off after 2 minutes.  I brush my teeth for 2 minutes and then brush my tongue so I find the fact that the Oral-B continues to run after 2 minutes is a plus.  The brush heads are cheaper than Sonicare and they have different kinds (basic cleaning, floss action -- which has little rubber floss picks in the head).  This brush gives you feedback when you press too hard.  My Sonicare Elite does not do this.  Cleanup is \'slightly\' more difficult with the Oral-B but the way the head connects is better making overall cleanup much better.  The Sonicare has a deep plastic well that houses the magnets that cause the pulsing.  Liquids (water, saliva, toothpaste) can get in there and it is not easy to get it out fully, even with a Q-tip.  Over time, this can cause mildew, so I have had to use a q-tip in alcohol to solve this.  The way the Oral-B is designed, this would never happen, you just remove the head, rinse it and give the brush a quick wipe on a towel.  The design is very good and supports easy cleanup.  I hesitate to put the wireless remote brush monitor in the \'Good\' category, as I don\'t like it, but some people who are really gadget-heads might enjoy this.  Basically it is a small LCD display that shows you where you are in the brushing cycle and gives you a visual cue when you\'re brushing too hard.  The brush itself gives you this feedback though, so I think this wireless thing is kind of \'hokey\' and when the batteries die, I\'ll likely toss it in the box and throw it under the stairs.  The good thing about it is that both my wife\'s brush and mine connect to a single wireless display without \'pairing\'.  I haven\'t tried to use it at the exact same time as her, but this obviously would not work.  It has tiny integrated legs so that you can lay it down on its side without it rolling away.THE BAD-------There is a \'mode\' button that lets you cycle through the five brushing modes.  It is right where I naturally want to put my thumb so I have had to train myself to put my thumb elsewhere so I don\'t keep changing modes while I brush.  It is much louder than my Sonicare  The Sonicare works by a magnet turning on and off rapidly so there is no connection between the brush head and the \'motor\'... In the Oral-B, there is basically a tiny axle that connects the motor to the brush head.  This is inherently noisier than the Sonicare design.  I don\'t find it terrible though.  I do not find the wireless lcd display to be useful.  Everything it provides can (and is) provided by feedback in the toothbrush itself.  The wireless lcd display is just another thing to clutter your bathroom vanity.  With that said, the pricing does not make it feel as if I paid extra for the lcd display so I am not too concerned about it.THE UGLY--------Nothing about this toothbrush was terribleOther things to considerThe brush has various modes (high speed, lower speed, one that slowly goes from gentle to vigorous and back, one that pulses, etc.  I believe there are 5 such modes).  I do not use them because my gums and teeth are not sensitive so I use the vigorous mode full-time but maybe somebody with sensitive gums would want the pulsing mode so they could have some gum stimulation without over-doing it."

At first it tingled so much touching my tongue that I had to take a break from brushing, but after a few days I got used to it. I haven\'t used electric toothbrushes before, so I can only compare the Oral-B Pulsonic to manual toothbrushes. I find that the Pulsonic leaves my teeth feeling smoother than my manual toothbrush and, apart from the tingling, it doesn\'t seem to have any negative effect on my gums.Pros:* Non-contact induction charging mechanism means there\'s no metal contacts to get dirty and prevent charging* Built-in timer to remind you to spend the recommended 30s brushing each quandrant of your teeth* The smaller of the interchangeable brush heads allows you to brush hard-to-reach areas* Teeth feel very clean and smooth after brushingCons:* Non-contact charging mechanism is less efficient than a wired connection and therefore wastes energy* Rechargeable battery is not replaceable - the entire toothbrush must be replaced when the battery wears out* It doesn\'t come with a carrying case.

It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.    "

Also the Smart Guide doesn\'t sync with the toothbrush, therefore it can\'t provide your any indication to adjust your brushing pattern.ISSUE 2: The LED went from showing 3 battery bars to no display, and went dead in the middle of my brushing. I left the toothbrush in the charge station and checked on it hours later. it is still unresponsive, nothing on the LED screen on the brush except being tempered with water moisture.Until now, I realized it is 100% designing flaw from Oralb because I experienced the same problem with my last 2 Oralb toothbrush.

The replacement heads aren\'t too expensiuve either. I get my 3 packs here on Amazon for $13 and you only have to replace them every 2 months I\'d say - but you could wait longer and it still works fine. It even tells you when it\'s time to replace by starting with blue bristles that slowly turn to white as it\'s used. It has a timer on it so you brush your teeth for the full recommended time. When your done it shows a smiley face. It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want. It doesn\'t hurt your teeth and does a great job, you don\'t even have to press it to your teeth. If your looking to buy one - buy this one. It\'s so great I even bought myself a second one for when I travel. :)"

I am the kind of person that finds a product that works and uses it for a long time.  I have been using Mitchum deodorant for over 10 years.  Because of my allergies to perfumes and fragrance, I could not use the other Gillette Clinical Strength products. However, when I found this one, it passed the sniff test.  Although it has a scent, it is best described as a \'masking scent.\' This means that while the product is on me, I do not smell it. I can smell it when I put it on, but it does not make me sneeze.  That means, throughout the entire day, I have the protections of the product without the fragrance.The deodorant instructions state to put it on at night, since that is when it works best.  I follow those instructions, but I also put on a small amount after my showers.  It is hot in Southern California, and I have to walk a far distance to teach my classes on campus. I sweat, and what professor wants to stink in front of their class?  Compared to the Mitchum (and a few others I experimented with) this product is the best deodorant I have ever used.  I do not smell myself in front of the class room while teaching.  I have worked outside all day, sweating in hot weather, and when I come inside the house, my underarms smell like I just put the deodorant on.I highly recommend this product.  I have allergies, so I am limited to certain kinds of hygiene products.  Although not completely scent free, this deodorant has done a great job controlling odor and wetness without bothering my nose.  I am more comfortable now because I do not have to worry about smelling bad when talking to someone!Give it a try, and I hope it works for you!    "

Like Sonicare, this model is using the \'proximity\' charge method where you place the toothbrush\'s body on the base and charging takes place when the base is plugged into an electric outlet.- Extra brush - this model comes with 2 brushes, one mounted on the body and one extra.- Easy brush replacement - you simply pull the mounted brush to take it out, push the new one in.- $3 coupon to be used when purchasing replacement brush heads.Not so good or annoying:- The packaging is atrocious. It comes in one of those bullet-proof clear plastic enclosures that you must cut with scissors and make sure you don\'t cut yourself in the sharp edges while at it. It took me several minutes to extract the contents off packaging and I did manage to do it scratch-free.- Vibrations are a little too strong - this MIGHT be my Sonicare bias (which I\'ve been using for longer than I can remember) but I felt that this VITALITY was a little too aggressive. My teeth are a little bit sensitive and they didn\'t like that.- A little too noisy for what I am used to - of course, an \'ultrasonic\' toothbrush noise is harder to detect because... it\'s ultrasound.When compared to the higher-end products, it may be worth noting that the VITALITY does not come with a \'full\' timer. The toothbrush does tell you when the 2 minutes are up (noise similar to revving an engine) but it does not turn itself off and, more importantly, it does not give you 30-second signals so you can switch \'quadrants\' as the higher end products do.The VITALITY offers a lot for the price but I am not sure that \'price\' is THAT meaningful when the topic is our teeth. It\'s probably preferable to most manual toothbrushes but, for a few dollars more you can get a lot better. Overall this is a decent product but if I had to replace my higher end toothbrush today, knowing what I know after trying out this product I would NOT go for the VITALITY and sacrifice features and convenience. The few dollars saved would not justify it.Three stars, meaning \'It\'s Okay\' seem to be the fair rating on the Amazon scale."

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it\'s kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

Changing the angles of the blades and adding 2 extra, it seemed slightly ridiculous, what was next 15 blades?  But upon using the 5 blade wonder from Gillette I quickly found that the hype was worthwhile and the end result was the greatest shave I had ever gotten.  Smoother, quicker, and with less irritation then I ever had before.  I tried going back to the Mach 3 but it was impossible, the stakes had been raised.  It was only a matter of time before a womens razor with 5 blades would be released, could the magic happen again?You bet it could.Being in martial arts I found the benefits of shaving areas that men don\'t usually shave as opposed to staying hairy all over (go ahead and insert your metro sexual jokes here) and have used a womens razor for years so I know what I am talking about.  With the edition of the lubricant outer edge, the aforementioned 5 blades, a comfortable grip and a shaving station to put your razor back, this newest invention by Gillette truly is a work of art.  Razor burn is a thing of the past and irritation has been sent out to pasture as well.  My wife loves the quality of this new razor and her legs lasted smoother longer.This is one of those cases where once you try you can\'t go back.

It does shave very close, but not closer the other 3 bladed razors I have used.  After the 6 months of use, I found that it shaved very well until I had to shave over the edge of my jaw and chin where it failed to give a good clean shave right under my jaw-line and chin with the first stroke.  I found if I try to shave closer, I got to many nicks.  I only got a close shave in those areas after I lathered up again and shave agaist the grain, but at times I did get razor burn doing that.  With out question, my old Gillette Sensor Excel with it\'s two blades did a much better job with only one stroke.  The Sensor Excel seems to huge the surface of my face much better, and the Mack 3 Turbo seems not to keep all 3 blade in contact with my skins surface when going over my jaw and chin.  All in all, I would have been happy with the Mack 3 Turbo\'s shave, it\'s great looks, and I really love the new handle.  And most of the time, if I shave slower I got a great shave after lathering up again and shaving against the grain.  However, I was not happy at all with the way the blade got dull so very fast, and there not cheap!  This is by far the biggest disappointment with the Mach 3 Turbo and the reason I give it only 3 stars.  It\'s also the reason I went back to my Sensor Excel until I got my new Gillette Sensor 3.  I think the Sensor 3 shaves just as close at the Mach 3 Turbo and does ever better in the problem areas under the edge of my jaw and chin.  The Sensor 3 blades are about $1.00 less per pack and last much longer then the Mach 3 Turbo Blades.  And one more good thing, I can use both Sensor Excel Blade and Sensor 3 Blade with both my Sensor Excel and new Sensor 3!  I\'ll keep the new Sensor 3 at home, and keep my old Sensor Excel in my travel bag to use on my many camping and fishing trips, vacation or when ever away from home.  I would recommend the Gillette Sensor 3 over the Mack 3 Turbo because of these reasons.    "

At first, we thought it did a very good job cleaning our teeth and gums, but it started feeling weak.  I\'m not sure if the toothbrush lost its full power after the first week, but the pulsating just didn\'t seem as good as our older Oral B.We returned it to Amazon as it seemed defective, and purchased the Oral B Professional Series 5000.  We\'ve used it for a few days now and it draws rings around the Sonicare.  The oscillating motion of the toothbrush alone leaves our teeth, gums, and overall mouth feeling much cleaner than anything we\'ve ever used; feels almost as good as a cleaning from the dentist.I highly recommend this toothbrush over the Sonicare.

I decided to wait the couple of weeks so I would have the \'latest and greatest\'. Boy, am I glad I did!I wound up picking up the preview kit over Memorial Day weekend.

Been an Oral B user for over a decade,"Oral B SmartSeries 5000The Oral B 5000 is the top of the line electric toothbrush. I used to have an older Oral B from the late 1990s that worked well up until the point where I couldn\'t find it around my house. The Ni-Accu battery pack was running strong and I could have used it for another 5-10 years. Then I got a few Oral B Vitality units from the dentist for free, which use inferior Ni-Cd batteries and have a battery life of about 3-5 days with regular usage. My old Oral B could last 3 weeks on a single charge.The cool aspect of these Oral B units is that a lot of their brushes are compatible. The Precision Clean, Sensitive, Polishing, and new Floss Action are interchangeable with a few exceptions  (like the Cross/Dual action garbage). The Floss Action worked horribly in my Vitality, but seems to work incredibly well with this SmartSeries 5000. I think it has to do with the RPM/speed of the motor. The Vitality comes across as grindy/noisy when it is operating, while the SmartSeries 5000 is smoother and faster.While brushing in the Daily Cleaning or Sensitive modes with the 5000, the Floss Action brush really works to clean my teeth and gumline. It doesn\'t hurt like it did with the Vitality! The Precision Clean brushes are probably the de-facto standard, but I invite you to try the Floss Action heads just to see how it feels. I also have the Sensitive brush heads that I want to try later on. I can tell you for a fact that my teeth felt cleaner brushing with the same Floss Action head on the Smart Series 5000 versus using the Vitality or a regular tooth brush.What does the Smart Series 5000 offer over other brushes? Well, the 5000 has a LCD indicator on the unit itself to tell you the battery\'s state of charge. Neat gimmick, but I have wondered in the past whether my toothbrush was good to go in terms of state of charge. Wonder no more, because you get a bar graph indicator!The 5000 has 2 buttons: one to turn on/off and another to select different cleaning modes. It defaults to daily cleaning (same as Deep Cleaning), and progresses to feather/sensitive, massaging, polishing, and deep clean. The Deep Clean changes the timer to increase the amount of time for your brushing, but it is the same speed as the daily cleaning mode. The timer defaults to counting up, and fluctuates the brush head speed every 30 seconds to tell you to switch quadrants in your mouth, and does the typical Oral B twitch at 2 minutes to tell you that you\'re done.The wireless timer/clock module is a neat gimmick offered on the 5000 and not the 4000. I don\'t find that it is particularly mandatory, but It does have a clock and changes to a timer when you use the brush. It also lights up a red LED if you press too hard on the brush head while brushing. While experimenting, I found that you really had to jam down on the brush head to cause it to cut power to the brush. Chances are you\'re not brushing hard with an Oral B because you want the RPM\'s to do the work with the brush. I tried SonicAire and other products, including Oral B\'s cross-action, but found the traditional Oral B to be the ultimate.The Smart Series 5000 comes with 1 Floss action head and 1 polishing head. The bristles are also indicators, you\'re supposed to change them when the blue color disappears halfway down. I find that this generally occurs every 6 months, and you can order new heads from Amazon for a lot less than buying them in stores (usually).The Smart Series 5000 also comes with a plastic hard travel case, and a slim charger unit that is more of a ring than a peg like on the older models. This makes cleaning a lot easier. The included battery is a NiMH cell, which means it has a much higher capacity than NiCd and doesn\'t suffer the memory effect. I am going to keep the Vitality as a travel brush, so if someone from the hotel nicks the Vitality, it\'s not a big loss.The Smart Series 5000 is a very smart investment for your personal dental hygiene. I brush with Oral B at least once a day (at night before I go to sleep). My dentist and hygienist always mention how clean my teeth and gums look, so the Oral B must be doing its job!Overall: 5/5 starsUPDATE: 4 MAR 2011After running the Oral B Smart Series 5000 without charging it, I noticed that I can easily get 10 days of normal routine usage (2-3 times a day for 1 person) before the battery meter starts blinking with 1 bar remaining. I used it for about 12 days and estimate I can get another 2-3 days before the battery is totally drained. As someone that travels routinely for business, I can opt to not bring my charger along for week long trips because I know the battery can last at the least 10 days before needing a charge. I\'d push it as far as 15 days!UPDATE: 19 NOV 2011I decided to push the Oral B 5000 as long as possible without charging it to see what would happen. After 22 days, it was still running fairly strong. I can detect a decrease in RPM because the voltage is probably too low. So that is roughly 44-60 minutes of total run time. It will easily handle most business travels without lugging around the charger. I noted that the low battery icon started flashing after 9 days of usage or roughly 18-20 minutes of operation, but it kept running and was still running after a total of 22 days on a single charge."

The packaging is very attractive, green with seafoam blue as is the color of the razor itself. One positive aspect of the Gillette products is that you can actually get into the product through the packaging without spending ten minute tyring to cut into the plastic. There is a perforated entrance in the back of the package that opens easily. This razor comes with a cute little round receptacle that holds the razor and attaches to the shower head.  All of this makes the razor attractive but the real test is whether the razor works well. The Venus Embrace has 5 shaver heads and gives the smoothest shave I have experienced.

Not until I tried this one that is.I zipped over my legs quickly and with no nicks and very little skin irritation, then had very similiar results under my arms.  So far, so good but really not so different than the cheaper disposables I have been using.  When I moved on to the more difficult, more personal areas though I was really impressed.  The small, floating head of this razor followed the curves quite easily, and again no cuts or nicks.  The best was yet to come though when no razor bumps appeared later.This product does come with a holder designed to be attached to theshower with suction cups, a nice touch.  Overall the Venus is a bit pricey, especially compared to discount store bags of disposables, but the ease of use and the close shave, without irritation makes the expense worth it.    "

She\'s also a fan of Pantene hair products, so Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Series Dry to Moisturized Conditioner sounded like something that would help out with some of those issues. It seems to be helping (in conjunction with the Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair series shampoo that I purchased separately). Her hair is less tangled and seems to be stronger and less dry, no small feat with our water, which seems to be extremely chlorinated and dries everyone\'s hair out a good bit. It of course smells great and seems softer to the touch as well. She\'s used much more expensive hair care products before, and these seem to be as good as any of those have been, if not better. While I don\'t think the effects are quite as dramatic as we were hoping for, I see that as a problem with our water rather than blaming it on this conditioner. As it is, it does work, and that\'s all either or use could ask for. We\'ll be buying this again. "

They\'re not perfect, but they\'re the best that I\'ve found.  When I saw this new Venus Pro Skin, I decided to give it a try because it\'s actually cheaper than buying a new pack of blades (less blades, so more per blade, but cheaper overall) and you get a new handle with it, which is always nice because the handles can get dirty over time.The box opened astonishingly easy.  No scissors required.  This handle is a little bit longer and has more of an angle to it than other handles in the Venus series.  I thought that was nice.  The see-through light blue color was very pretty too.  Compared to my old Venus, this razor looked sleek and shiny.  I become more skeptical when I examined the new razor heads, though. The razor is surrounded by two gel pads.  There\'s nothing backing them, no plastic holding them on.  They move easily up and down as you touch them.  I\'ve had experience with some of these in-head shaving gel products before and have found that they usually completely fall apart or all of the lotion/gel is gone in about two shaves, when of course the razors should last much longer than that.Using the razor I found that it felt very nice on my skin.  I could tell the gel was helping lubricate the skin, but it wasn\'t overly sudsy.  However large strings of gel kept coming off the razor.  This was a little bit gross.  Also the head was too large to fit into tight curves and made it really hard to shave certain spots.  As I expected, one shave used about half of the gel pad, which is a big disappointment.The big test for me is after I get out of the shower, though.  For the first time in ages I didn\'t have any nicks from shaving with a new blade!  I always dread switching blades because I always get cut up.  Also my legs didn\'t itch.  I frequently have trouble with razor burn and itching, and this product actually solved that for me when nothing else has.So where does that leave me?  This product worked wonders for protecting my skin when nothing else has.  I love it for that reason alone.  But the gel pad isn\'t going to last more than a few shaves, which would mean that I\'d have to buy a new head every few days.  That would be ridiculously expensive, but honestly maybe worth it considering how much I do suffer from razor burn normally.  I think if you have problems with razor burn, you should give this product a try.  If you\'re looking for a new handle for the Venus, this one is very pretty.  But if you\'re happy with your current shaving gel routine, these gel pads are bulky and won\'t last hardly any time at all.  For those people, I think this product is a waste of money.    "

I got a smooth shave without nicks and I found the semi-solid handle to be ingenious.The five blades, on the other hand, seem a bit like overkill.  I shaved one leg with the five bladed Venus Embrace and another leg with my three bladed plain old Venus and I honestly did not notice a difference.  Both were smooth at the start without nicks, and both grew back at about the same rate.  I\'m of the opinion that the quality of your shave depends more on the quality of the blade than simply the number of blades.If you\'re looking to get this razor just for it\'s five blades, I can\'t say it\'s worth the cost.  As a razor, it\'s great, but it\'s not better than a three-blade as far as I\'m concerned.However, the semi-solid handle may be worth it.  It\'s comfortable to hold and use and moves with you to some extent.  It gets in the tight places better than other razors and helps to keep you from pressing too hard against your skin as you go.As for me, I\'m keeping my Venus Embrace handle and buying whatever cartridges are least expensive when I go shopping.  With four kids, I find the Venus Breeze cartridges to suit my short shower needs best.  Those and the Embrace handle are a great fit for me.    "

Ladies, you know how it is, after a couple of decades, shaving your legs becomes a chore to dread. The Venus Embrace has eased that chore for me. I\'ve used Venus products for several years, but this one is miles ahead of past versions, and it does everything it claims to do.Yes, it is comfortable to hold--rather like those pens with the soft rubbery stuff on the outside. I think it makes the razor less slippery in your hand as well. That\'s important in the shower especially. The holder is oddly shaped, but there are no hinges to open or to break. Time will tell if that open design is a good thing or not. It did fit well and unobtrusively in my cramped shower. I loved the suction cups though as opposed to the old sticky stuff.The most important thing, however, is the actual results from using the Venus Embrace. Here, it really shined. Smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I deliberately made only one pass to see how well the product worked. Perfect! One pass was all that was needed; my legs were smooth, hair-free, and without a single nick or scrape. There was a slight scrape on my underarm, but that could have been user error. How long that moisture strip lasts has to be determined over time, but so far, I love this razor. It\'s my new product of choice.    "

My mom bought me a pack of these at a local drugstore MONTHS ago and I\'m still only on my second blade.  During the winter I usually only shave my armpits daily, and since my leg hair doesn\'t grow much in the winter anyway, I only shave them once every week or so.  The small amount of use has probably contributed to keeping the razor clean and sharp.  I leave it in the shower everyday, but I always make sure it stays on a shelf where no water accumulates, so that probably helps too.The moisturizing strip has long since been depleted, but I really don\'t notice a difference in the shave.I usually hold the razor near the bottom and rest my middle finger lightly on top of the actual razor part, because it seems like if I don\'t, it won\'t have enough pressure to get every nook and cranny.  It\'s not really a design flaw; I like it because it gives me a lot more control over the pressure.  The flexible head is AMAZING.  If you\'ve always used cheap one-piece disposables, you are missing out.  I have probably only gotten cut once or twice with this razor (around the ankles--mostly my fault for not being careful enough), when I used to get razor burn and cuts EVERY SHAVE with non-flexible one-piece razors.I strongly suggest you buy these.

And it\'s really not too bad for $30.First, you have to realize that if you\'re moving from a normal brush you have to re-learn how to brush. No more moving the brush rapidly with your hand - press the button on the handle and it starts whirling at high speed. Press the brush to your teeth and gums and sloooowly move it left to right or right to left. Make sure you get all three sides of top and bottom, and that you get the gumlines - that\'s the most important part. Obviously it doesn\'t really matter what order you do it in, but if I don\'t keep a pattern I get distracted by pets or people and forget. After two minutes the brush will briefly stop the motor a few times to let you know you\'ve brushed enough - next time you can adjust your movement speed to hit that mark.It includes an induction charger - just set the handle on it. You can do it every night or once a week.So how does this $30 model compare to the $90-120 models? Well, the grip is noticably cheaper, with no rubber grip stripes. The induction charger is very easy to tip over compared to the sturdier \'well\' model. There\'s no charge indicator. The whole thing feels a little bit more flimsy than the 8900, though it never felt like it would actually come apart. There\'s no 30 second indicator like the better models, and there\'s only one speed, though I never found the other speeds on the 8900 useful anyhow.All in all not bad for $30 - of course they\'ll get you for $3-4 each for replacement head, but that\'s only every 3 months or so, and this comes with one head and one spare head. And I think you\'ll do a better job with this than with a regular brush - it\'s very easy to pay for itself if you just get one fewer cavity. If you want one of the above features spring for a better model, but this isn\'t bad for 1/3rd the cost."

I was quite surprised that after two weeks using the Proglide that I have to say it does indeed provide a better shave than the previously mentioned model. I\'m not sure it it\'s the thinner blades that seem to offer much less resistance both against the grain as well as with it, or one of the other features. The power version also has a feature that claims to guide the hairs in straighter for a more close, even cut. While I\'m not sure if this is a gimmick or not, the proof seems to be in the proverbial pudding. For me, the shaves have been much better with less irritaion, and so far the blades seem to last longer than the old version. On the older version I could only get three good shaves at the most before feeling it was time to replace them. With the proglide I only have had to change the blades once in two weeks, and the performance has always been fantastic. Of course, these statements are just my \'two cents\' worth, as shaving is very subjective and there are so many factors that go in to a great shave. But for my purposes, this new Proglide seems to fit the bill very nicely.    "

They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.    "

Always though it would be too much trouble, or I was going to hack myself up.  Well, the other day I saw the commercial for Gillette Fusion Proglide and it sparked my interest.  If it does what it says, I was finally ready.  I was tired of the electric razor, shaving my neck was always a difficult adventure, always had to pre-shave so that the hairs were not too long, or the electric would yank those hairs out!So I finally took the plunge, while out picking up a few things, I grabbed the Gillette Fusion Proglide, and took it home, hoping that it was as easy as it sounded.  Since shaving with a electric was a different animal, and I wasn\'t sure how to go about it, I checked out the Gillette site to find a nice video on pre-shaving rituals, and much more.So after dinner I went at it, this rookie prepped his skin and hairs, and foamed up with the gel that came with the razor.  I started slowly, and softly, and there was barely any feeling.  As I started to figure out how much pressure I could use, and what was the best direction to shave the parts of my face, it was a snap.The first shave took me as long as my electric, but I that\'s the first time rookie shave, it will, and did get easier as I went along.  It was sooooo easy to shave my neck, and absolutely no tugging, and didn\'t get a nick or cut.Being the first manual razor I\'d ever own, and being an absolute rookie at this, the Gillette Fusion Proglide was  the best shaving experience I\'d ever had, and I would recommend the razor to everyone!

I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless.  Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head.  When compared to the Mach3 which you had to use for this area the closeness is not even in the same league.  That\'s my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I\'ve used.  My only con is how damn expensive the blades are.  I\'m trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that\'s about the best I can do. That works out to about $6 a month just to shave.  I\'m going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices.

The single blade side is good for trimming my side burns and my mustache.  I also like the Lubrastrip and when it is gone it is about time to change blades.  It is a good indicator of the razors usage.The grip elastomer coating on the handle makes it nice to shave with as you can get a firm grip on the razor even with wet and soapy hands.

I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \'made for a woman, not a man.\'  This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.Like the standard (purple) VENUS BREEZE, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR (pale pink) comes with a holder which mounts directly to the wall of your shower or bath.  Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  The three blades are surrounded by gel bars.  There is no need to use shaving cream; just moisten the gel bars to get that silky, satiny feel.  The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme climate.To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  This will help any razor to give you a closer shaver.  While you are soaking, get the cartridge wet, so that the gel gets creamy.  You never want to shave with a dry razor anyway...ouch!  I usually just toss the razor in the tub for a minute or two.  Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  Just one less thing to worry about.The only negative about the VENUS BREEZE is that the gel bars do not last as long as the blades!  With care, the blades in each cartridge last up to a month.  (The triple blades shave my legs so close, that I really only need to shave them every other day.)  But the gel bars either run out or fall off in 2 - 3 weeks.  Then I go back to the shaving cream until the blades give out.Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  I have been satisfied with it for many years.  If Gillette could just make the gel bars last a bit longer...the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.    "

1476,1056,1085,20080414,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 14, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,Great Razor,"I have thick hair which grows in rather quickly. I have tried probably most hair removal products on the market. This includes a huge number of razor types, hair removal gels, buffers, sanders, yankers, radio signal needles, and much more.I admit that when the first more-than-two razor blades came out, that my boyfriend and I thought of them as a silly gimmick. The only reason we tried one is that a friend of ours worked at Gillette and I wanted to give her some feedback on how they worked. We thought it would be a wash. We were quite surprised that it did actually provide a better shave.In a way, it makes sense. The whole reason to have multiple blades is that hair is not all orderly and in a line. The first blade might cut off some of the hairs, but some will just bend beneath it. That bending then creates tension for the second blade to be able to cut it.If you only needed two blades, then you could do a single pass with a two bladed razor and have it completely clear all hair in its path. Of course, that doesn\'t work - at least not for me! When I then tested out a three blade razor, it definitely cut more hair on the first pass. Also, because you now have more \'cutting power\', you don\'t need to press as hard.So does this logic move on to give blades? Again, I was a little skeptical. First, the ergonomics of this razor are just GREAT. I\'ve tried many, many types of razors over the years. They can be very slippery in the shower. This one has a super combination of shape and texture. It fits nicely in the hand, and stays there securely.I also really like the wall attachment that this tucks into. The attachment holds spare blades as well. It stays securely on our shower wall and is easy to put the razor in and out of.So how well does it work? I\'ve tried it with a variety of soaps and gels. It slides smoothly and with the five blades it cuts thick hair with just one draw, without much effort. The without much effort part is really key. It means you get far less cuts, because you are not pressing down into skin bumps or goosebumps. You don\'t get razor burn because the blades are not dragging hard along your skin, slicing off the top layer.I haven\'t had any problems using it on any part of me. Underarms, legs, ankles, you name it. I would most definitely rather have the five blades with its gentle cutting power vs a smaller version. Heck, smaller razors with two blades *do* exist. There\'s a reason I use this one instead. It simply works better.Highly recommended.    "

But I\'ve been ignoring the latest generation of razor blades because it seems the price has increased with each additional blade and innovation. While I don\'t want to have hairy legs or underarms, I\'m also economical and was skeptical over whether there would be enough difference in the results to justify the cost.  OK, so I\'m cheap - but life is expensive.The moving action of the blade reminded me of a Swiffer.  You don\'t have to put much pressure on the handle for the blade head to respond.  I initially thought the oversized blade might make it hard to stay with my leg, but it actually seemed to help. Despite the fact that the size of the razor blades themselves is probably about the same as the old Venus or another brand, it seemed like it took less time to shave my legs - maybe due to the fact the blade gripped my leg and I didn\'t have to keep going back to where I left off.I have to confess that the results of the Venus Embrace Razor may make it worth the increased cost - at least for those times when your legs or underarms are on display - like at the beach.  I felt as if I got a closer, smoother result with no nicks or scrapes than I have been getting from my 3 blade Venus razor, darn it all!  It\'s a great product, but I\'ll probably only buy for use during summer months; until I win the lottery, the $24.99 for 8 cartridges/blades is too expensive for everyday use no matter how much I like them.Update:  05/10/08 - I\'m afraid to say that having used the Embrace razor blades, I have now been ruined for the others.  I returned to my former blades and there was simply no comparison.  I thought maybe it was my imagination, but when I bought more Embrace razors, I found to my horror that they were every bit as good as I\'d remembered.  Save yourself if you want to avoid this expensive addiction and don\'t try them.  I have no doubt that if you do, you\'ll find them every bit as good as I have and won\'t want to shave with anything else.    "

There is absolutely no way this is a 4- or 5-star product. I call shill.I\'ll start with the few good things about the razor:1. It feels very nice in hand. The \'grippies\' are in just the right place. It has a nice heft with the battery in. The size and shape fit the hand nicely.2. It looks very cool. I really like the orange and grey/silver meme that has been going through design the past few years. If anyone watches you shave, they will be impressed seeing you with this. However, I, for one, typically shave alone so this isn\'t worth much.3. The battery level indicator is very cool and effective. It\'s hard to describe, but I wish everything I own that uses batteries had this indicator.4. The single blade on the back of the razor is brilliant. It\'s not as effective as I\'d like, but it is much better at keeping a sharp sideburn line than the five blades. I suspect the angle/ position will be worked out in the future.Now the bad:1. It doesn\'t shave any better than any other razor I\'ve ever used. Yeah, it gives a pretty close shave. But my tried and true Sensor Excel blades, the handle of which I purchased in 1996, give just as close of a shave without any of the other problems listed below.2. It\'s very expensive. $30 for 8 cartridges?! Ridiculous. Absolutely not worth it. The Sensor Excel 8 pack is literally half the price - still more than I think they are worth - but gives a better shave.3. I\'ve never had a more uncomfortable shave. The blades catch my stubble, making for a very slow shave. Yes, of course, shaving with the \'grain\' of your beard reduces this problem but it still happens. Most people have swirling grain somewhere on their face. This razor makes shaving those areas very difficult and slow going.4. The blades have a short lifespan. I am only able to get 3-4 shaves out of a head before the stubble-catching problem gets so bad I can\'t use it. By contrast, my Sensor Excel blades easily last 7-8 shaves - about two weeks, though by the 7th or 8th shave it is catching pretty bad too. My straight edge doesn\'t have this problem at all, given a quick run over the strop before each shave.The overall experience is expensive and uncomfortable and results in a mediocre shave. It is a disappointing product and not worth the investment.    "

This IS the \'Time Renewal Restorative\' in repackaged form!,"My hair is naturally curly and definitely gets frizzy. When Pantene released the Time Renewal series, I tried the \'Frizz smoothing\' formula and was THRILLED with the results. I always feel my hair is incredibly soft, shiny, manageable and best of all SMOOTH after using the shampoo and conditioner. It is also the only shampoo/conditioner that I can remember ever using the the smallest amount still lathers its way completely through even extremely long hair.So I kept it on hand, and then Walmart stopped carrying the product!When I finally noticed this product, with its purple and gold writing on the front, like the previous reviewer I did a little research and voila! This IS the exact same stuff! Same formula, same price....(WHY on earth do they do that?!)I almost always use the conditioner a lot faster than the shampoo, so I was happy to find this 3 pack in the \'subscribe and save\' store.All in all, my FAVORITE shampoo/conditioner set, and one I HIGHLY recommend.P.S. Try pouring plain white vinegar into your hair after the conditioner, letting it sit just a few minutes, then rinsing it! Vinegar (super cheap stuff!) strips the excess materials from the hair and balances the pH. Shiny, soft, and smooth! "

Batteries last 3-5 years (meaning 3 years), AND once the battery is exhausted and no longer holds a charge, you have to throw away the entire unit.The company\'s explanation is that the unit is water tight so removing the battery breaks that seal. This is horrific design flaw - if they wanted they could allow for battery replacement.BUT...allowing battery replacement means you wouldn\'t have to BUY AN ENTIRE NEW UNIT.So...essentially the consumer is being held hostage to a company that\'s designed a product that has to be thrown away.LASTLY...there is no easy means of recycling. I was told I had to go to a Braun service center. On Long Island. 30+ miles away. That\'s irresponsible. A company should stand behind their product; offer, at the very least, a reasonable outlet to recycle something.

Or people will think the power ones are better.  Bottom line: Gillette thinks you are gullible. Buy the non-power blades.The overall shave is good if you shave everyday. For longer growth the mach3 is better since you have a wider spacing between blades to avoid clogs.As with the mach3 power the vibrations seem to give a better shave: soothes the skin, helps unclog the blades, might lift hairs better.

Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient.The tub isn\'t too tacky looking and fits the wipes perfectly. It also keeps them from drying out.

Well I just used this tonight (trim and shave) and it works great for both. I\'m totally happy with it and for under $20 for a top tier razor and trimmer, with a great design (especially coming right out of the gate with this brand new product), you can\'t go wrong. Highly recommended. I paid about $18.74 at Walmart and they\'re sold out now. People know and love Gillette!    "

I recommend it.No allergic reaction thus far.  I have several skin allergies and sensitivities, and have experienced minor problems with a few other shampoos, and not-so-minor problems with several kinds of soap.  I will add a comment to this review if I have a later reaction or other problems.It has made my straight, flat hair look somewhat fluffy; it appears to have more body. Note that this was achieved by merely shampooing, followed by partial drying with a towel; no blow dryer used.The shampoo seems somewhat concentrated, not watered down.  It left my hair and scalp feeling thoroughly clean.  Unlike some shampoos, it has not left my hair feeling as if it were coated with anything greasy or heavy; just clean hair.While shampooing, I noticed only a very subtle scent, that was not specifically feminine nor masculine. It did not leave a noticeable scent my the hair.  A day later, if I bury my sensitive nose in my hair, I can just barely detect a vaguely plant-like scent, gender-neutral.P.S.  My husband also uses this shampoo, and it works well for him too. "

Nothing new to this type of toothbrush, really, but combined with the slimmer, more lightweight overall package, it adds up to a really great product!

Normally I wouldn\'t buy a toothbrush for $100, but in a few weeks when I get $50 back, it will justify me spending $50, even though that seems a little steep for a toothbrush.  But nevertheless, its a steal of a deal right now.So onto the product. Overall I am very pleased with it.  My teeth felt amazingly smooth and clean after the first brushing.Since I\'m not an automatic toothbrush guru, I am not sure of the sizes and noise of others.  In my own opinion, I feel like it is a tad heavy and large.  But once again, its got a motor and battery in it unlike my manual toothbrush.I read other reviews about the base of the unit and storage compartment for the brush heads being too large.  I however have to disagree with that.  The base unit is just larger than the base of the toothbrush, as the toothbrush sits in it to charge.  The storage part holds 4 tips and snaps to the base.  Once again, I don\'t know how others compare, but to me the size of it seems perfect for my counter space (about 8 sq ft).The plug however seems large.  But oh well, I\'m also not an electrician so I don\'t know why it needs to be that big.The Wireless Smartguide is pretty cool as well.  It gives you a timer and choice of count up or count down modes and a ingenious idea of having 4 zones (for each section of teeth).  This 4 zone thing blinks for 30 seconds indicating which zone you should be brushing in and provides a visual timer of when to move on.  It makes it idiot proof for brushing for the correct time.  I find myself brushing for about 4 minutes because the 2 minutes fly by which is a plus to the health of my teeth and gums.I am really impressed with the \'extras\'.  Really, when you buy electronics you ALWAYS need to get your own batteries for it.  With this, the Wireless Smartguide came with 2 AA batteries in it, as well as 2 more.  4 batteries!!! You never get batteries included let alone EXTRA batteries.  Ha, needless to say, that\'s coll Oral-B.  You also get 2 brushing heads, the normal flossification head and the pro-white head.  That\'s another plus with getting another brush head included in the package.  You also get the travel case.  Which I haven\'t used yet, but still cool.I have read others complain of the \'roughness\' of the brushing.  The manual does state that it can take time for your teeth to become used to the brush and your gums may bleed some.  I however had no problems gum bleeding or feeling like the toothbrush was too rough.The only negative I can say about this toothbrush is sometimes while brushing the chewing surfaces of my teeth, the back of the brush head hits the opposite chewing surface.  It doesn\'t hurt, but it doesn\'t feel great either.  Guess I just need to remember and learn to keep my mouth open more while brushing.All in all, great product and would definitely recommend to my family and friends during the promotion period where you get 50% back.  Can\'t wait for my rebate check!"

The only con I can think of is that they can be a bit pricey if you buy the singles so I would suggest that you either buy the biggest multi pack available to save the most.Update- still the best but I have found an electric shaver that finally gets close to the smoothness, Norelco 3D 1290.

The first couple days using the Fusion were okay, but I immeadiately noticed I couldn\'t get as close a shave as with the Mach3. A lot of this is that the Fusion has a large surface area, so it\'s hard to do a lot of detail work, sort of like painting with a roller brush. The single blade on the back is supposed to compensate for this, but except for doing a mediocre job of cleaning up strays under my nose, the single blade was useless. The first Fusion cartridge gave up on me after about a week and left my face barely looked different before and after the shave. Even after replacing the cartridge, my face seemed to get used to the Fusion quickly and stubbornly refused to give me a good looking shave, no matter how many times I scraped those Fusion blades over my mug. I also found myself working harder to get the shaving gel and water off the Fusion between strokes, which is annoying.I should say that my face is a little weird in that the hairs grow very slowly but are very tough. I used to shave against the grain (up the face) for this reason but found I could get away with shaving with the grain using a Mach3 regularly. So, for people with softer facial hair, the story might be different.The one advantage I\'d give the Fusion is that it does tend to work best when you only use one stroke down an area, so for people who get easily irritated by multiple blade strokes over the same area, this could help.I switched back to a Mach3 blade this morning though, and couldn\'t be happier. I have a lot more control over the shave, it\'s cheaper to buy the cartridges, and in general it\'s just a better experience. It will be a sad day when/if Gillette drops their Mach3 line, probably in favor of some 9-bladed shaving monstrosity.    "

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos "

Just a week ago (Feb 16, 2012) the battery had gone dead on it. I was pretty happy considering it lasted over 6 years. Granted it was a little more expensive than the 5000, I still expect this SmartSeries to perform as good if not better. When reading the manual on this toothbrush I seen the section on the battery in it. It gave instructions on what to do if and when the battery goes dead on it. I tried to perform the procedure on my old Sonicare since they have the same basic structure. I couldn\'t seem to open the bottom of it and any suggestions would be great. However, I don\'t even know if the battery on that model is even replaceable. When I first turned on the SmartSeries 5000 I noticed a BIG difference that my old Sonicare. The sound was extremely different. The Sonicare had a tight buzzing sound that sounded very well built. The 5000 had more of a loose buzz. It is a bit louder and makes me question if its going to last half the time my old toothbrush did. Who knows, maybe this is a new addition that cleans your teeth better or maybe I\'m just so used to my old one that I question anything different. The Smart Guide system on this brush is pretty cool. If you have kids, it will definitely make them want to brush. There\'s a smiley face that gets bigger and bigger the longer your brush. You can stick the Smart Guide screen onto a mirror or the wall. The toothbrush also has a monitor in it that lets you know if you\'re brushing too hard. There is a red light that is very noticeable on the handle that lights up when your pushing too hard. It is compatible with 5 different brush heads that supposedly do different things. I don\'t know if this is just a selling point or what but I find it pretty handy. Overall, there is not much difference in the 1000, 1500, 3000, or 5000. Just a couple additions the higher the number but the basic stuff is going to be there with all of them. If I had to do it over I would have gotten a cheaper one. I thought getting the biggest and best one would have more advantages. It\'s still a good buy and I have no complaints as of yet."

There is nothing truly special about it. The scent is very \'right off the shelf of the drug-store\'. It smells like every other bottle of pantene to me, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing. It is what it is!The conditioner doesn\'t seem to phase my completely unruly, pin straight, fine yet dense hair. I have the strangest hair. Some days it feels very thick and voluminous and others it feels very flat and light. I want a conditioner that adds a nice density to my fine strands but doesn\'t cause my scalp to get oily after a few hours. This doesn\'t do the trick for me.I am also turned off by the fact that this is NOT sls free. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the cheapest method for a company to get it\'s product lathering or textured a certain way and it is literaly the same stuff they use in car wash soaps and degreasing chemicals for car engines. In the same way as it dissolves the grease on the car engines, sodium lauryl sulfate also dissolves the oils on your skin, which can cause a drying effect, which in turn might cause an overproduction of oils, as is my case. It is also well documented that it denatures skin proteins, which causes not only irritation, but also allows environmental contaminants easier access to the lower, sensitive layers of the skin.Products with SLS are not only dangerous for the skin but they can also effect a person\'s hormones and lead to various forms of cancer. So, in the long run, it is better to invest the five bucks you would pay for a tube of this stuff and get something that is CLEARLY marked SLS-FREE. That said, for those less conscious or interested in the harm that SLS can cause...this conditioner will probably be a staple in your shower. It smells fresh and does it\'s job OK for that everyday-pantene price.It\'s not something I would ever buy or endorse though. "

The little vibrating action of the battery powered handle really made a huge difference in how easy it was to shave, and the razor glided right through thick stubble with no problem at all.  The thinner blades didn\'t clog up and washed out pretty easy (which was a HUGE complaint about my older Fusion), and after using it for a few weeks, the blade is duller but not as nick happy as I thought it would be.So while the hype is still pretty big, I was surprised at how genuinely good this razor ended up being.The bad part?  Well, this thing is EXPENSIVE.  The handle is affordable, but you\'re paying $22 for 6 refills.  Thats unbelievable!

Precision Clean only has the round group of bristles at the tip of the brush. The correct way to use this brush head is to run it slowly over each tooth. This cleans very thoroughly.

I could not believe the difference between my regular disposable razor and this one in terms of how smooth the Embrace felt while shaving.  In fact, I couldn\'t tell if it was doing anything--which felt weird at first because, with my regular razor, I can clearly tell that it is.  Even stranger was that, while I couldn\'t FEEL that I was shaving with the Embrace, I had razor burn when I put on my deodorant after shaving, whereas I usually don\'t have any razor burn when using my regular razor.  It\'s very possible that I may have unconsciously pressed harder because I was used to feeling my other razor and that caused the burn, so this could be \'user error\' and not a product fault.  Once I am more accustomed to using it and have broken out of my old habits with my old razor, I will have a better idea of which it is.Design-wise, the gel-grip handle is great for good grip in the shower, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the \'pod\' that sticks on the shower wall and holds the razor and the extra blade cartridge.  However, once I took the razor out of the pod to shave, I couldn\'t quite figure out how to get it BACK into the pod.  There is only 1 way it fits and it took me a few tries to find it (it seems obvious, because you know it has to fit into the pod at the narrowest point of the handle but, even with that assumption, it still took a few tries).All in all, I was impressed with the Venus Embrace Razor.  I took off 1/2 star because, while I love concept of the pod, I thought it should be simpler to get the razor back into it without having to think about it, and I took off another 1/2 star because I got razor burn when I don\'t usually (but as noted, that may have been my fault).Edited several weeks (and numerous uses) later to add:1. Once I got used to using a lighter touch with this razor vs. my old one, the razor burn problem substantially lessened to the point where I am having little or no razor burn now.2.  Once I got it in my head that the razor always goes back in the pod with the blades facing IN (which make sense), I have found it much easier to get the razor back in the pod without fumbling around.

I visited my friend couple of days ago and I had to borrow his razor, which was the Fusion.  The problem with this blade (and also the Quattro, and also to some degree the 3 bladed razors) is that because the blades are so close together, the cut hair gets stuck between the blades more easilly.  This requires more time rinsing between strokes, so it overall doesn\'t save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive, so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it\'s important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades (compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel) helps in shaving large parts of skin, like legs or whatever.  But when it\'s your face with its nooks and crannys, I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort. The 6th blade feature was OK, but didn\'t feel like it was worth it.Remember, that with any NEW blade, you will get an awesome shave.  People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it, because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they\'re reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit----Recently got this as a gift.  Same problems as listed before.  I\'ll just use it until I run out of blades.    "

My dentist (who just so happens to be my favorite medical professional) has been relentlessly hounding me to come over to the electric side.  Every six months she\'d ask,\'Didja gettit yet??\'  and I would sheepishly reply that I still couldn\'t fathom the $80+ toothbrush. Of course, upon examination of my rear molars she\'d wax philosophical about those who properly brush for the full two minutes, and follow the listerine-floss-brush system every single day.  Finally, I gave in.  Mostly because I lost my dental insuranc. I figured I should step up my home cleaning to make up for missing a routine cleaning or two.Now for the technical:The setup was completely intuitive.  It came with a multi-page english/spanish instruction booklet, which being human, I did not read.It has three modes of cleaning, I really only use the one.  Every 30 seconds it makes a little pulsation, which allows you to time how long you clean each toothy-hemisphere.  (30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right) This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.  Like lying on the couch with the dog and the boyfriend.  Comfortable, perfect.I swear my teeth are cleaner looking.  I don\'t swing with that whitening paste, it ruins your enamel. I think this brush makes the difference. My gums feel awesome and healthy.Seriously, what have I been doing all my life??"

It seems much harder to shave with and pulls at my face more. This is coming from someone who loves the mach 3 in its various forms. I\'m not sure what the problem is. Maybe the blades are too close to each other or something. Maybe trying to cut so many hairs at once is a bad idea. All I know for sure is it\'s not smooth.  It\'s not just a slight difference either. I go back to the mach 3 which I still have and I immediately notice the difference. Maybe others with different beards will have better luck but for me this razor down right sucks. I\'ve given it a fair shake too. I\'m still trying to use up the blades I stupidly bought.  However I can\'t ignore the fact it is far worse.Edit: I want to add one more thing. Whey you first put a new cartage in the razor does a pretty good job. If you tested it for one shave you might think it was good. However it really degrades very quickly. The second day it\'s noticeably worse and it just goes down hill fast after that. Again I am comparing this to a Mach 3 which I can keep for a much (and I mean MUCH) longer time and have it shave pretty good.  There is definitely some technical problem with this razor and I think a lot of people posting good results have a) tested it once b) are shills for Gillette c)  are in denial after spending a lot of cash on it or d) have a beard like a baby\'s butt.

The floss can shred a little bit, but no worse than any other I\'ve tried, I won\'t bother deducting points for that.

After 2+ years though the battery is finally not having as much power and not lasting as long between charges so I put it on the charge every day. But it doesn\'t quite have the power it did when new. All things considered, I have no problem with this rechargeable toothbrush lasting 2-3 years as that is more than I expected. The best part is that Oral-B still makes the Vitality and I can use the extra brush heads that I previously bought on the new Vitality that I just purchased. The brush heads are not cheap, about $20 for 3 so I did not want them to go to waste. I really like the cleaning action from the Dual Clean brush heads and they don\'t seem to be too harsh either.If you are looking for a great, reliable and inexpensive electric rechargeable toothbrush, I highly recommend Oral-B\'s Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush."

What is more unnecessary is to sacrifice performance just to make something more, to quote another reviewer, \'aesthetically pleasing\'. When it comes to my dental health, thanks but no thanks, I will take performance any day over form. Compared to the other brushed I have used, this tiny brush definitely feels less effective. Don\'t get me wrong though, this is not a horrible brush. Had I never used any other electric toothbrushes before, I probably would be satisfied with this brush just fine. But after using/reviewing a number of different brushes from Vine program, I\'m used to that more powerful and super fast cleaning offered by the full-size models.

Since I have a unisex name,  I occasionally get men\'s products. Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it. I\'ve never used a razor with the vibrating feature on it before, but I found this great for my legs, especially my knees and ankles. I\'ve NEVER cut myself using this blade, because with the vibration turned on, it\'s pretty much impossible for me to press down too hard. It doesn\'t vibrate too much to where it\'s noisy or annoying.As far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth. I can go 2-3 days between shaves, and when my hair starts to regrow, the hair is finer and not as \'stubbly.\' I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I\'ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus. I also love that this works so well on my underarms. Because it\'s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I\'ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before. This shaves super close without cutting or razor burn. And my legs are smooth ALL day, even if I shave at 8 in the morning. They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night. Ladies, you know what I\'m talking about.I haven\'t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy. The blades seem to last a while, at least 3-4 weeks shaving every other day or so. However, when they go dull, they go dull quickly.The only things I didn\'t like about this razor: one, it didn\'t come with a blade refill, like every other razor I\'ve ever bought, so that was kind of annoying. Also, the refills are expensive. Don\'t buy the \'power\' refills if you don\'t use the trimmer- that\'s the only difference between the \'power\' blades and the \'manual\' blades, and there\'s a dollar difference between the two. I don\'t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out that it\'s just an exposed blade on the opposite side, but I can see how men might find it useful.Overall, this is my favorite razor. I bought the refills even though they were expensive, and will probably be sticking with this for a long time.    "

This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it\'s no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn\'t bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I\'m going to calculate the number of shaves I\'ll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.    "

But for most guys, it simply doesn\'t deliver the closeness the \'old-fashioned\' 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:1) They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  But in the current Proglide commercial, the cartoon is altered to show the second blade doing nothing except scraping the skin, with the hair ending up sticking out above the skin surface.  Major BS here by Gillette.2) If you\'re not comatose, you\'ll notice on their \'Take the Proglide Challenge\' commercials (the one with the used-car salesman guy), they are actually comparing Proglide vs. a DISPOSABLE RAZOR!!!  What does that prove?  How low can Gillette go???Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn\'t totally worthless.  They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  Bottom line is, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  After 2 shaves, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that\'s less close AND less smooth.    "

Some have thick fast-growing hair, some thin slow-growing, some medium thickness fast growing, etc. Everyone\'s different. Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don\'t need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it\'s what works for them.So far, these Fusion Power\'s are the best for me. My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors. The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3\'s came out, and the Mach3\'s were equally tossed when the Fusion Power\'s arrived. The reason - the 2 blades hurt, I cut myself lots, and wore out in one or two uses. Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut. These Power Fusions However, I must emphasize: *have yet to cut me*. I think the vibrate function is to thank for this, but I\'ve yet to cut myself when the battery runs out either, so it may just be the blade.Here\'s what Gillette does not want you to know though: these things last a LONG time. You can use one blade for months with minimal degradation of the blade quality, as long as you use the vibrate function and cream. How do I know they don\'t want you to know this? Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they\'d like, and so there\'s a whole marketing bend they\'re on about checking your indicator strips to see if it\'s time to replace. My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn\'t as quickly disposable.That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me. No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I\'m barely buying one pack a year.    "

The razor works fine without the power feature which vibrates the blade.  At first, I liked the power feature and used it for about one week, but then I just found it a bit annoying and haven\'t used it since then.  The power feature actually slows you down a bit as you cant rush the blade over your stubble as I have become used to doing after a hot shower in the morning.  I can tell that using 5 blades gives me a slightly closer shave than my previous razor with 3 blades (the mach 3) but I honestly don\'t care about the slight difference.  Hence I have come to the conclusion that this is not much of an advance in shaving technology, in a strange way, it is actually a step backwards as the prices of blades have gone up without a real noticeable enhancement in my shave.  I am glad that they haven\'t stopped making my previous blades and will likely switch back to those after I have used up all of my fusion blades.    "

The head is large and contoured, ideal for mowing down wide swaths of follicular profusion. The shower caddy is a neat idea. It is backed by two suction cups for gripping the shower stall (tip: works better when wet) that conceals a small, swing-out storage space for extra blades. The swing gets loose easily, so careful!

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for four Flexisoft EB17 heads for $24.99 (The EB17-4 just means there are four of them).  There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $12.99.

It does NOT navigate curvy legs very well. I had more than one significant cut the first time I used it.  I felt like the head pivoted a little TOO much which made it hard to keep the blades in contact with my skin.  The gels strips do not lather, but do have a very strong, but not unpleasant fragrance.  However, if you are sensitive to perfume, this is not your razor.Because the head is so bulky, the shave actually took longer than with a straight razor. The bulbous looking things on either side of the blade created drag on curved areas, such as underarms and ankles and didn\'t glide over those areas successfully.  I had to go over them several times to remove all unwanted hair.I would say this is BETTER than the Soliel razor that I bought for less money (smoother shave) but not as good as the Venus Embrace which gave me a smoother shave with a little less effort and no heavy perfume.My overall complaint with ALL of the Gillette Venus line is that the razors are very bulky. They do provide a good shave, but you have to cover the same areas more than once because the shave head is so large.  For my sensitive skin, that means more razor irritation.  I would recommend this one over several other out there, but if you want the best shave for the same price, go with the Embrace.    "

Since that generally means I use different deodorants, I\'ve also found that I am fairly sensitive too--some deodorants (that don\'t brag about being strong) will irritate my under-arms.  That\'s not a good combo--to be blessed with genes that make me perspire more than average, yet be sensitive to many deodorants.So, enter this Gillette Clinical Strength.  I had both very high hopes (that it would solve my odor issues), yet was a bit worried that, especially since I had never used anything Clinical Strength before, that it would surely irritate me in some way.To my surprise, everything seemed great.  It\'s basically odorless, goes on smoothly and doesn\'t leave any residue.  Thankfully, no irritation whatsoever, to my surprise.  On a day to day basis, it covers me all day long with no odor (which is way above and beyond many deodorants I\'ve tried).The ONLY reason it didn\'t get all five stars is because I can occasionally tell that it didn\'t fully cover me; but only when I\'ve been doing a decent amount of physical work or been in the heat.  Perhaps I\'m asking too much, but for me, the perfect five star deodorant would be able to get me through a 24-hour period even if I did a decent amount of physical activity.Even though I\'m a very frugal person, and although I was \'manly\' enough to occasionally break through this deodorant, I will certainly pay a premium for this deodorant in the future, as it works better than all the other many brands I\'ve used.

I didn\'t even realize I was brushing the lower teeth more.  I recently had a cleaning where I was told my upper back teeth had more plaque than lower.

I found that due to it\'s size it did need fixing on a curve or two, but overall I was very impressed. I have been using Gillette disposable up till now. So it has impressed my skin, but now it has to make peace with my wallet. It all boils down to how long the blades last. I expect at least a week out of each. Usually those green \'lube\' strips are the first to go and after that the razors become pretty brutal. AT this price point I don\'t want to use more than one blade every week.

Whenever these shaving companies come out with these number-of-blade toppers, the inevitable question asked is \'where will it end?\'  I think the BladeMask comment answers that question in a facetious but, hey who knows, perhaps accurate way.  Touch&eacute;.I\'ve always been a (very) early adopter of Gillette blade innovations, so I bought the Fusion first day of release.  [ Hey, A.G. Lafley bought the whole freakin\' company after testing a Fusion prototype, so that\'s a pretty good testament.]In terms of the Fusion itself, there are pros and cons vs. upgrading from the Mach Turbo 3.The pros:- Does seem to be a better shave (certainly takes less strokes, that\'s for sure).  Gillette has succeeded in raising the bar again.- I suspect you\'ll get less wear on each blade meaning you\'ll be able to keep the blade in the razor longer.  [A key point when you  read my \'cons\'.]- The industrial design of the razor, the blade and how the two pieces fit together is a thing of beauty.  A real indication of the increasing pervasiveness of CAD in every aspect of our lives and the need to compete on functionality, price AND design.  [Thank you, Steve Jobs.]- The blade on the back is a real breakthrough.  Sounds bizarre in concept, but great in practice.  You\'ll keep your sideburns straighter and not bang up that space under your nose trying to cram 3+ blades under there.The cons:- Well, of course you need that backside razor because the darn surface face of the blade contraption is so big (this is the \'Big Bertha\' of razors) and spongy-flexible like a teenage gymnast that you can\'t get the shaving impact area within a country mile of the undersize of your nose.  The backside razor isn\'t just a coolness factor; it was birthed out of necessity.- Gillette has now taken its famed \'give way the razor to get the blade revenue\' business model (and the mother of all business analogies) to a price-gouging extreme.  $25 for eight blades? (and that\'s the discount).  What will happen is that shaver across the world will look for a way to extend the life of each blade.  Gillette famously doesn\'t recommend when to change blades  leaving the decision to each shaver (and, hey - Richard Nixon and I had different shaving needs, so how could they possibly recommend a standard).  But - my reaction will be to double the tenure of each blade I put in play.  I think others will consider the same practice.    "

Now to the point...- Quality of the cleaning - My first impression is that the feeling it leaves after you use the brush is slick and clean.  Im usually the type to brush when I can and I do religiously.  I feel this product does the job well and faster than using a manual toothbrush.- Charge - The charge last pretty much exactly what it says.  Depending how often you use it (I use mine twice-morning and night) It lasts about 10-14 days.- Timer -The quadrant timer is something that is useful as well.  I like how it \'paces\' you through the brushing.  There are times when my mind wanders and with this it gives a little pause in the vibrations to prompt you to go to the next quadrant in your mouth.- Durability -Its been about 5 or 6 months since I\'ve purchased it and it doesnt seem to have any durability issues.  When spending any more money for a high dollar item this is a concern for me.- Sound - The sound is a little bit louder than the Sonicare, but it wasn\'t a big concern for me.Overall, it was a choice between this and the Sonicare line, and I went with this after lots of research.  I like how this comes with a nice travel case so for the trips it is easy to store.  Many of the Sonicare products that is in the same price range did not.  Also the replacement heads for the brush are cheaper with the Oral B (more options to pick also)and it might not be a big deal to everyone, but I\'m sure the cost all adds up after years of use.  With all that aside, I\'m very happy with the product, because of the quality of cleaning. It says 2 minutes for a total clean, but I go the 2 minutes plus an extra 45-60 seconds and I get a better clean than manually brushing for 5 minutes plus.  I never had a \'break in\' time to have my gums adjust, which some people might need, but it was fine and gentle enough for me.  Ill never go back to manual toothbrushes again."

All you want to know is does it smell good, and does it control your sweating or at least keep it to a minimum? Well you don\'t have to worry about body odor. It has a nice, clean smell that is not overpowering. As for sweating, I live in AZ and we are already hitting 100+ degree weather and by around the afternoon I was sweating. So if you live in weather that barely hits 90 degrees, then you will probably be fine. The one bonus with this is that it does not stain your shirt which I find to be a major plus.    "

I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use. This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED. I was initially disappointed as I realized I had a brush head that didn\'t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed. URGH... I decided to give it the weekend before trying to call customer service on Monday to get a replacement. However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions. When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean! Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush (forgot what they call it) and the fact that it continues to brush past 2 minutes. The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines. And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!! And an added bonus is that the replacement heads are even less expensive and the brush it self had a $15 rebate so less than the cheapest Sonicare too.And I\'ve only had it 4-5 days now but I am certain my teeth are already whiter than they were and less stained!!"

Yes, the replacement cartridges are very high-priced BUT you\'ll get an ultra-smooth and very clean shave every time--and your skin will thank you. The idea of a 5-blade razor may seem extreme to some but it really does work well and (with proper preparation) will give you the smoothest shave possible. For me, the best thing about the Gillette Fusion system is I can shave (both my head and face) with virtually NO irritation, redness or razor bumps AND get it done very quickly (at least in comparison to single or twin-blade razors). Case in point: I used to literally tear up my neck (especially around my Adam\'s apple area) years ago when shaving with single or 2-blade razors but with the Fusion I get a nick-free shave almost every time.

I thought it was okay, until I tried this one. This is a fabulous brush.Pros:1. Rechargeable battery. Not likely to lose juice any time soon-just make sure you charge it for 12 hours before use.2. Small handle. It\'s not much bigger around than a regular toothbrush, especially when compared to the monster I\'ve been using. The charger is compact, too, and doesn\'t take up much room on my counter.3. Compact head. Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.4. Soft bristles.5. Vibrates rather than spinning. The spinning kind really chewed up my gums. This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations. Went away as soon as the brush was off.6. Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth. I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore. I don\'t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.7. Stops briefly to let you know when it\'s time to switch \'quadrants.\' (You\'re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.) When the maximum 2 minutes has elapsed, the brush gives a double signal.8. There is a precision attachment to get between teeth and into dental work.9. Does a fantastic job. My teeth are very clean.Cons:A bit louder than I expected, but certainly better than the SpinBrush, and the vibrating tickled my jaw. Hardly worth mentioning, though.I am incredibly pleased with this product. I would definitely buy this again and will recommend it to all my family members."

I\'m giving it two stars because I guess it does some things OK, but it\'s really bad, at clipping without the combs. WHen I use it to trim, with one of the attached guides, it does OK. But when I use just the clipper, without the attachments, that damned thing keeps opening up.I have a thick beard, and trim it back until it\'s stubble - which I what I bought this unit for. But the damned thing will open up and pinch my face, about five times, every shave. To use it, I have to pinch down on the head so hard, that my index finger gets fatigued. This thing is garbage! Oh, and the battery does not last long, but I guess that\'s to be expected with AA.If you\'re using this to trim a beard with some height (eg. using one of the attached spacers), it does a reasonable job. But if you\'re looking to shave that beard down to stubble, as I do, look elsewhere. I can\'t believe more people haven\'t run into this issue! I regret the $20 I spent on it, and with Gillette put a fraction of their Marketing budget into R&D. Or maybe some of their execs should actually try using the B.S. products.    "

I was initially skeptical about the abundance of gadgets here - five(!) blades, a battery, a single \'trimming\' blade, lubri-strips, and who knows what else, but this thing really, really works.  I do not understand the purpose of the vibrating feature, but to my surprise it doesn\'t cut me to ribbons, and does indeed seem to have the effect of cutting closer.  There is no substitute for the right shave cream (I use a product called King of Shaves), but the lubricating strip on the Fusion adds quite a bit of \'slick\' on its own.  I have never had a closer shave, and cannot imagine one.  I have had professional straight razor shaves at that barber, and have come home to let the Fusion finish the job.  Yes, the razors are \'price of oil\' expensive, but I find that they last a loooooong time (maybe 2 weeks out of each?), and actually improve with use (they work better with a little seasoning).  I also own a Schick Quattro by the way, and the Gillette smokes it.    "

I WILL LOOK NO FURTHER.","(This is Lisa\'s son speaking.)Shaving has been a frustrating and embarrassing experience for me for years.  There has always been some kind of trade-off between closeness, irritation, tendency to produce ingrown hairs, price, and speed of use.  I never understood how my friends and family members were able to achieve a close and fast shave on a regular basis, while I would shave twice as slowly and get a shave half as good as theirs. I\'ve tried manual razors, electric foil razors, and electric rotary razors.  I had settled on manual razors (only shaving with the grain) because it produced the least irritation and didn\'t leave patches of uncut hairs like all the electric ones I\'ve tried.  Unfortunately, due to my pattern of beard growth, manual razors tended to leave me with ingrown hairs all along my jawline, despite my best efforts to prevent them.  I had figured that I had to settle for dealing with them until now.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best of the manual and electric shaving worlds.  It provides a much closer, faster, consistent, and comfortable shave with no ingrown hairs whatsoever.  Superior in all ways.  You have no idea how relieved I am to have found this razor.    "

I happened to have a Venus Vibrance (which has three blades) in my shower, so I tried the Embrace on one leg and the Vibrance on the other. (I did not turn on the vibration on the Vibrance, because I have never found it to make any difference and because I felt it might skew the experiment.) I put a new blade on the Vibrance, so that both razors were starting out on as level a playing field as possible.There was very little noticeable difference in performance. Both razors shaved my legs smoothly. The only drawback to the Embrace is that it has a slightly larger head, which makes it a little difficult to maneuver around knees and other tricky areas. I saw no difference in closeness of shave between the three and the five-bladed razors; and a few days later, I saw no difference in the amount of stubble.Overall, I\'d say that if you are a first-time Venus buyer, the Embrace is a fine choice; but if you already have a Venus razor, the Embrace really isn\'t an upgrade, and there\'s no reason to buy it.

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos "

It was a loud and eventually became sloppy in holding the spindle from turning around requiring the handle to constantly be rotated. It still was very effective and still holds it\'s charge without fail.Long story short, I did research and ended up choosing the professional care 5000 over the 4000 as a replacement.  The sticker shock held off the purchase until I found a 50% rebate and free priority prime shipping.  I really prefer the \'polishing\' heads and bought 6 extra.  Net cost was about $55 which is about + price of the additional brush heads.There is no comparison between this and our old model.  It is quiet and has some cool features.  There is a visible battery (fuel) gage on the handle, and a transmitter to communicate with a seperate remote unit.  This thing times you, is a clock, and even blinks if you brush too hard. The travel case is well constructed and useful. Buy one...rebate took about 2 weeks...mine was a $55 check.PROS:  quiet- cool features- teeth feel like you just had a cleaning...squeek and all- noticed definate whitening almost immediately- find myself brushing more often by choice, angled position allows makes getting to back teeth a non-issue. We love it and highly recommend it.Check out the polishing heads which have a yellow rubber center. It saves the outer bristles and you still get more than adequate flossing and unbelievable plaque removal. It really extends head life especially if you brush hard, like my wife. Trust me on this; I smoke cigars.NEGATIVES:  Really none..somewhat pricey heads, but more gental than even soft hand brushes."

That all changed when we received the Fusion Proglide Power Razor.  My  husband is resistant to trying anything new, so it took some nudging to get him to try this.  In the past, he bought whatever was on sale and used it until he hated it and tried something new.  He has very sensitive skin and could not use an electric razor, so he wasn\'t very keen on something that sounded suspiciously like it might be a hybrid of old and new.  Once he used it, he was delighted. In 30 plus years, I have never known his face to be so smooth and free of stubble. This is possibly the best shave he has ever gotten, and it left his skin smooth as a baby\'s face, and in great condition.  The shave was close, smooth, and he actually enjoyed using the razor.  He also told me to leave it alone, and to buy my own!  There are coupons in the papers this week, so I am going to do just that, and buy the one made for women.  This is a really great product.  It fits nicely in the hand, it\'s got an interesting shape, and it does what it promised to do.  I have very sensitive skin, and in the past when he rubbed his face against mine, I got red angry patches on my cheeks.  Not even a hint of it this time, so we are both very pleased with this product.  It seemed to float over his skin, and it left it in the best condition that I have ever seen.  I don\'t think anything would persuade him to going back to his old razors, and in fact, he did throw them out!  This is a great product, and we highly recommend it.    "
3599,426,434,20120414,B0002KHTG6,2,"April 14, 2012",A34E2DIWNBEJ19,"Too big, too hard",This is a nice idea for a brush but poorly executed. The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision. The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure. Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums. I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.

I believe this so called improved design (Precision Clean Brush Head) is much more inferior, in terms of the quality of the bristles, than its predecessor. The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage. Obviously Oral-B is trying to cut corners here by offering a newer model with inferior quality.If you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine.

These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.I don\'t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it\'s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I\'ve never had any problems with the handle, and I\'ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.

After a few weeks of exclusively using this toothbrush there was no noticeable whiteness difference for my teeth. It was easy to use and there were no issues with it. I chose to return to the Sonic and will keep this one as a back up. The reason for this was due to the brush head since I had already picked up a replacement pack.

However, see my list of pros why this can be a good thing.Pros:1.  The applicator is made of smooth plastic, but with \'Anti-Slip Grip\' - ridges on the part of the applicator where you hold it when putting it in, so you have a better grip.  The last time I used tampons with cardboard applicators, they got slippery as heck when inserting them, so much that they were rendered unusable.  So, these Tampax Pearl tampons are far better in that regard.2.  These are unscented - fragrances in a tampon can cause irritation, so I\'ve always used unscented.3.  Easy to insert, and I don\'t feel them at all once they\'re in.  I will forget that I have a tampon in.4.  They\'ve never leaked, and I\'ll wear each tampon for a full 8-9 hours.

So please do NOT think this is only targeted toward girls with extra heavy flow.  If you\'re like me and always get so paranoid about leakage at night that you end up lying stiff straight on your bed and always sleep badly during your period, then THIS IS FOR YOU.I stumbled across this one by accident, as not all stores carry this particular size (at least not a couple of years ago).  Ever since then there is not a single day in my house that I don\'t have a pack of this stored in my cabinet, it\'s THAT essential.As I said before, I tend to sleep really badly during my period because i\'m so paranoid of moving at night and allowing leakage onto my sheets (which are a pain to wash out!)  Let\'s just say my crankiness during that time isn\'t all attributed to hormones!  After I started using this one though, aside from the usual cramps and back soreness, nothing else would affect my sleep.This pad is almost like twice the size of a normal day-time heavy pad, or 1.5x size of the old overnight pad I used to use.  The best thing about this, is that not only is it super long so that it covers all the way up to the top of your butt crack, it also has extra wing in that back area that spreads out and allows for more protection.  If you ever had issues where the old overnight is long enough, but liquid would leak on the side when you sleep on your side, then this will get rid of that problem.It is a huge pad though (my friend, who never used it before, when she saw me buying it she thought it was as big as a diaper x___x ) but I wouldn\'t want any thinner pad (even in the same shape and size) if only because the thinner it is, the less i feel protected.  And no matter what, I always want to be protected from leakage, not to mention being able to sleep better!also i only use this for the first 2-4 days or until the flow gets slow so that leakage won\'t really happen any more.  during the day or during the trailing part of my period, i switch back to regular sized pads."

The blade guards are far too short to trim anything other than maybe your kids pet hamster.The longest blade guide isn\'t even the shortest guide on my beard,and mustache trimmer...So as an average man with real facial hair,it\'s useless.I understand it\'s not really for \'beards\' but I\'m struggling for what good guides this short are for.It\'s not going to replace my beard & mustache trimmer (even in a pinch),and I can\'t see it really being good for small jobs,that I\'d rather use my beard & mustache trimmer for anyway...UselessI also didn\'t like the idea,of all my shaving gel,facial hair I\'ve shaved off on the trimmer blades.When I rinsed my shaving head off,the trimmer blades are pretty exposed to all that muck.The idea is good,but not for men..It just failed all around as a shaver trimmer,that I was looking for,I wouldn\'t waste my money on this (I regret that I did),unless you really are into manscaping    "

If you don\'t want to read it all, I give you this quick summary. Great product, well worth the price at amazon. Best clean you can get and has many useful features. I have never had healthier teeth and gums. Read further for more details.This product is simply outstanding and in a class of it\'s own.I had a situation in which my gums are not in their peak condition, and that is putting it lightly. I have had this toothbrush for just a touch over two weeks. I also drink coffee every day, only 1 cup though. Since I have been using this, my gums are already noticeably healthier, my teeth are whiter, and I find it easier to make sure I brush at least twice a day. I think this is mostly because of how much I invested into this product. At this point I have nothing but good things to say about this toothbrush.I also have my wisdom teeth fully grown in and this toothbrush is small enough where I am able to reach them and give them a proper cleaning. My wife is also using it with a separate brush head.The device takes a full 10 hours on initial charge before use, as seems to be normal for most NiMh batteries. At first the backing on the timer is a bit confusing and difficult to get off as the instructions do not help. Once you figure it out though, It is quite easy to master.Positive feedback:Now onto a more descriptive part about the features this offers. Since my gums are sensitive to begin with I can only use the normal clean and sensitive options until my gums are healthier. The other modes are a really nice feature that I plan to use when I can.The included 2 sided tape is nice for when you want to mount it to the wall.I really like how both the toothbrush and the timer give you an indication of when to switch quadrants in your mouth every thirty seconds. The timer will blink and display that you should be working on the next quadrant. The toothbrush pulses every 30 seconds and pulses 3 times every 2 minutes. (I personally don\'t think 30seconds is enough for each quadrant so I often spend more time after brushing to give my whole mouth a quick once over.)Once you get the timer set and mounted it does make a nice restroom clock as other have said. After charging and setting the timer, the toothbrush is easy effective and gives the best clean I have experienced sans a dental visit.Also a side note, I asked my dental hygienist which toothbrush they recommend for electrical as they said I should get one. This one came at the very top of their recommendations. Before this I was using Oral-B\'s cheap $20 electrical toothbrush. The difference is astounding.The container for the extra toothbrush heads is very nice allows you to let the head dry out while not connected to the handle. They brush heads are very easy to remove and clean. The different color rings are very helpful if you have more then 1 person using the same style brush head.The travel pack is a really nice and touch and is compact too.Best clean you can get without visiting a dental hygienist.Negative Feedback:The back plate on the timer is a bit unwieldy at first.The toothbrush is a bit loud but not as loud as the $20 dollar variants.IT would have been nice if the battery came pre-charged. It would also have been nice if the timer also came with a rechargeable battery solution.It is expensive and costs way too much at a standard retail store($150).It only comes with 2 brush heads."

When working, even though I made enough money then to buy the EXPENSIVE replacement cartridges, it always left me complaining about the price of such a wonderful shaving experience. Now that I am retired, I had switched to the old fashioned safety razor and began buying assortment packs of different manufactures blades till I found what works best for ME. Turned out, the very cheapest of the dozen brands, works best for me so I have been much happier shaving the old fashioned CHEAP way.  Enter this new version of my old friend....I had to try it since the one biggest downside for me with a so called safety razor is cutting myself. Since a recent heart attack and the blood thinner medication I now have to take, cuts are becoming a real problem. And this razor is SO much safer as well as more comfortable, I had to try it when offered on the Vine Program. Feels the same, looks a little better (to me anyway) than my old unit. Now, this \'soothing micro-pulses for incredible comfort\'? OK, if you say so....Myself, it is simply a major distraction! I can\'t feel what is going on since the vibration is just a MAJOR distraction to the shaving for me. I simply have stopped using this \'feature\'. Every beard is different, every shaver has their own preference. What one loves, another hates etc. Needs are different, results are different. I kind of found all the razor & blade reviews to be sort of useless for me since there are simply too many variables involved in this activity?  But there is one place this series of razor really excels. COMFORT! Vibrate or not, I would really have to want to cut myself, and want to badly to do so. It is buttery smooth for my face. That simply OUTRAGOUS price for new blade refills is somewhat offset by the fact this 5 blade model lasts a bit longer than my single blade safety razor blades. But it still costs so much more, that this return to this razor will end for me, once these blades are done. It is safe, comfortable, and such a close shave, I hate to leave. But retirement pay is just 1/5th of my old working paycheck and this is right at the top of the list for things to cut (bad pun...). Another thing I love about this razor is when I get up in the morning to shave, I have probably only 1/3-1/4th the beard to shave as compared to the next morning if I had used my trusty safety razor.  Bottom line? IF you can afford it and don\'t mind allocating this much money for new blade cartridges, enjoy! It is an amazing tool. I just won\'t spend the money anymore. And another thing, maybe it\'s just me? I see, nor feel, ANY difference in the closeness of the shave either using the vibration feature or NOT using it. When I use it, I really have trouble knowing how well it is cutting. I mean, I have NO sense of if it is cutting or not? Off, it is simply a wonderful razor, but one last time...IF you are willing to pay the high price. Wish I made more money!_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5/28/2010 Update:  OK, I have found another problem with this razor that applies to \'me\' but probably not to the general shaving public? I have several deep scars/crevice wounds to my face from my motorcycle & jet ski racing days (crashes...) This razor simply can NOT get into those areas where a single blade safety razor has NO problem. So if you don\'t have a perfectly smooth (scar free )face, it may not work well for you? I also did some math on replacement blades. Figure around $3.50-$4.00 per refill on this razor. On my safety razor, my blades cost me just 15 CENTS! That 15 CENTS, shaves me perfectly for 7 days. After that, the shave degrades till at 10 days, I no longer have comfort using it. So maybe this can be a guide to the insane cost of using this razor. Bug again, it is such a subjective thing. To someone who has a decent job, they may consider this cost trivial? Or, not even have realized just how out of line it is with alternatives out there. For me, back to the future with a good old safety razor works best. Now I remember why....Take a look at: SHARP STAINLESS Double Edge Polymer Coated Safety Razor Blades for instance. Then look at all the choices for blades in the good old fashioned safety razor. I would give this:- 4 stars for closeness on a smooth face-- 3 stars on a face with scars-- 1 star for cost-  Over all, I let my 4 stars stand since (again),shaving is a very personal & yet subjective thing. One razor doesn\'t fit all.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5/31/2010 Update:Well this will get me some hate mail but I have to downgrade my review from 4 stars to just 3 stars. Reason? I used to get up to 3 weeks of close shaves on the OLD style (see my pictures). This new one with new & \'improved\' thinner blades? Just 7 days and it is cutting me like crazy. But remember, I have to take blood thinner since a recent heart attack. More to the point, I have to ask myself, was this redesign just a way to make sure that the great (but expensive) shave of the old model, would be even better (but ONLY for the manufacturer?) if they discovered a way to get the old design blades not to last so darn long? If so, they REALLY succeeded! This blade is just used up for me after just 7 days. Now my old fashioned safety razor only costs about 15 CENTS. This one? How about $4.25 each???? Sorry, but that is just INSANE!    "

There are two cartridges in the package, along with the razor handle and suction shower hook.  The hook fastened well to my glass shower, and has clung since without problem.  The tortoise shell packaging has an easy-open flap in the back, which is nice.  I find the individual packaging of the cartridges a bit overkill, but I\'m not a big fan of packaging, in general.The cartridges slip onto the handle easily enough.  I noticed right away that the installed cartridge is a bit bulky. After dampening it, I found the blades were quite sharp, leaving a smooth, close shave.  My dislike of the Pro Skin razor is that it doesn\'t shave curved areas well, because it\'s so bulky you can\'t shave tight areas, and the gel bars drooled.  They were kind of gross, actually, and dripped down the handle of the razor.  That said, the gel bars left my skin soft and feeling as if I\'d put on lotion.  If you don\'t enjoy that sensation, these razor won\'t be your favorite.  By the time I had completed shaving the bars had worn down quite visibly.  I expect the Pro Skin will suffer the fate of other such inventions, which is the bars will wear down far in advance of the blades becoming dull.  Also, I can\'t imagine storing the razor any way other than on the shower hook.  It would leave a terrible mess laying flat.In short, it does a great job shaving, but for the mess and bulk of the gel bars I won\'t be running out to buy one.  If you need a smaller razor, stick to the original Venus.  If you need a moisturizing razor, spend the extra $4 and get the Intuition.    "

Let me just start off by mentioning why I rated this product 4 instead of 5 stars. All of the different setting on the brush seem fairly pointless so I think it it would be easy to downgrade to another Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series Toothbrush without the \'massaging\' \'whitening\' or \'deep clean\' settings. So this isn\'t really a negative aspect of the product but something that the consumer is paying for and doesn\'t seem to be getting any extra benefit. Save yourself the extra cash and just get one of the more basic models; I only use the daily clean setting.Since using the Oral-B I do believe that my teeth gave become more white and have a greater overall brush experience. I think this has much to do with the included \'Pro-White\' head that is included along with the \'Floss Action\' head. The rubber cup on the head really wipes away plaque and buildup. I can\'t really say that the \'Floss Action\' head is all that the name seems to claim but it does seem to be a great everyday head to use when accompanied with daily flossing.Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Oral-B Professional Care Series to anyone looking to take great care of their teeth.

4771,1598,1639,20080904,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 4, 2008",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,The new aesthetically pleasing brush,"Before I received the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush I was using the conventional, bulky, sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare).  Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  The Pulsonic is about the same size as a manual toothbrush, which is much smaller than all electronic toothbrushes currently on the market.  This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom (even the charger is not the usual eyesore).  Now to the nitty gritty, what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  Nothing, except unwanted complexities.  The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren\'t familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  This takes the place of the usual multi-button brush with a variety of settings, only one of which you actually wind up using.  The Pulsonic comes with one standard brush head and one precision head that has a brush area about the size of a toothpick and stiffer bristles.  The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  This is designed to help you spend the right amount of time in the four quadrants of your mouth, and has always seemed silly to me, but after using it for a while I am following the routine without even thinking.  The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very \'natural,\' and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter. Overall, the brush does everything a sonic brush should, none of the things I think it shouldn\'t and it takes up less space and looks great.  The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  If you\'re looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B."

I ended up with the Oral B Sonic Complete - it had 2 brush handles and a charger which was perfect since I still had the old charger.  It came with a travel case that fit the handle and a brush head conveniently for travel.  When it came time to buy new brush heads, I couldn\'t find them anywhere in a store, so finally decided to let my fingers do the walking and found them on Amazon at half the price of a store.  This particular brush and head are the best of all of the ones I have tried before - I love them and my dentist even commented that he noticed a positive improvement in staining around the spaces and gums.  I will probably never buy these in a store again."

If you simply cannot, or do not want to spend the money on the sonicare then I might buy this toothbrush.  I contacted oral b to ask if they offer a money back guarantee, which sonicare does. Oral b said they did not offer the guarantee on this model, but only on a couple of other models.  FIGURES!  The lady was polite, but I told her I was upset that I wasted my money on their product, and I will not be buying from them in the future.

I asked several dentists if they had any preferences. One thing I was told by two dentists is that electric toothbrushes are bad, because people tend to brush too hard when using them, ruining the protective enamel on their teeth.Well, I like to judge things for myself, so I did get one, an Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush. And I like it. I\'m careful not to press down too hard when I use it, and I don\'t believe it\'s harming my teeth. I\'m not as confident about that with the Pulsonic. I also prefer the battery-operated Advance over something that takes up more space around the sink and takes up an outlet. I get compliments for how white my teeth are, and I think the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is partly responsible.The Pulsonic is probably a better toothbrush, but considering the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is just $14.99 and does the job for me, I can\'t say it\'s worth the difference."

My son has a severe peanut allergy, and apparently with allergies comes eczema (skin condition that causes open sores).  We\'ve used steroids with limited results, and we don\'t like using it very much nor does my son as it\'s a pretty strong medicine.For some reason, my memory was triggered and I remembered my Japanese mother growing aloe plants and using them on us when we had an injury or received a burn (happens when you grow up on a farm).  I wasn\'t thinking of prevention, but healing his open sores that were getting pretty bad--on his arms, behind his legs, on his feet, and on his inner thighs.  (He is entering his teenage years, and is obviously very sensitive about his skin.  The kids at school always ask why he wears long pants, and not shorts like they do in school and after school).Long story short, I came across \'George\'s Aloe\' and thought what the heck, can\'t hurt.  It\'s a natural product and worth a try.  I also read that Aloe is a natural antihistimine.  We\'ve been using it for a week on our son, and the results are very positive.  It hasn\'t prevented the outbreaks, but it has diminished them noticeably.  I would say upwards of 80% improvement.  The spring is the worst time for my son, and it\'s been very manageable.  My wife and I have noticed a significant improvement in his condition and he drinks a small glass of George\'s Aloe every morning.  I tried it, and it indeed does take like water.  Read the directions, though, as you don\'t need much.I\'ve since supplemented the \'internal\' treatment with an external treatment of the actual aloe plant rubbed on the outside of his body (arms, legs, feet, etc.).  You basically just cut off a very small part of the leaf, and it\'s a gel inside.  I rub that on his sores, pimples, and hives and paired with the Aloe juice, has had a dramatic effect, a definite improvement for the better.  My son is much more relaxed of late, and very happy with the results.  It\'s not perfect by any means, but he itches a LOT less and he doesn\'t have the open weeping sores that he had before.  Again, it\'s not perfect, but a huge improvement.I think for others in the same situation, it\'s worth a try.  I would just make sure there isn\'t some sort of allergy to it--but I\'ve never heard of an allergic reaction to Aloe.Finally, my wife has tried a lot of remedies on my son: lotions, aforementioned steroids, hot showers followed by vaseline to keep the moisture in, etc., and none of them has had the same noticeable positive effect as Warren Laboratories \'George\'s Aloe\'.A very enthusiastic and strong 5 Stars for this product.I hope you find a use for it, too."

They just leak, period (no pun intended!!).I ordered these in Super Absorbency from Amazon since they had such a dirt cheap price for the 2 boxes. I did use up both boxes just so I didn\'t feel like I wasted my money, but I will never buy them again. I had the same terrible results with both boxes.I cannot imagine using them if you have extra heavy or heavy flow."

It feels much cleaner, and although i didn\'t believe it at first, my teeth are getting white because the brush is lifting the stains out.

I was hesitant at first on purchasing this, but i thought about the investment and teeth so i have no regrets. Although this brush sounds like it will jack hammer your gums and teeth away, i got used to it pretty fast. My gums did bleed a bit, but that was expected. Now they look and feel much healthier. Although i thought the smart guide was just a little \'buy me i\'m unnecessary\' kind of device, i find it pretty helpful especially for a first time user like myself.

I was skeptical of the braided string, however, I learned the hard way that the braid really does help with some leaks.

My hair looks great right after it dries but quickly flattens or blows around, especially if I go out. With a little skilled misting of this product, it stays voluminousness and controllable even with a little wind.A light mist goes a long way but if I know I\'m going to have a long day or encounter bad weather, I just use it a little heavier. It still looks good but in order to get much lasting control for these situations you must be willing to live with what my girlfriend refers to as \'crunchy\' hair. It can look a little dull and feel crispy, but gets the job done.It\'s a versatile product best used lightly when you know you\'ll have a relaxed outing. Of course, for long days or bad weather, there\'s nothing I\'m aware of that does much better in terms of crispy, dull, or yucky.Oh, and don\'t use it in a confined space.

Oh well, on to the Fusion.I really cannot tell a difference in the quality of shave between the Fusion and the M3.  I agree with another reviewer, if all things are apparently equal why spend the extra money?One drawback to the Fusion is that it is hard to clean thick shaving cream out of it.  I\'m not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick.  I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it.  Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out.  I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades.  Either way it annoys me.To sum it up...sure it\'s a good razor, but it seems more novelty than anything else.  The M3 is good enough for me.    "

Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren\'t secured in their package.  Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  And since you\'ve already bought the item, there is no need for overly attractive packaging either.  The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can\'t re-use the packaging from the store).As far as longevity, I\'m probably about as tough of a test case as you can imagine.  I\'ve got thick, stubborn hairs on my next that lay sideways and reverse direction in certain spots.  Every time I shave these razors get a good workout.  When a razor is too worn, it is a painful experience and leads to immense amounts of irritation.  Needless to say, I notice pretty quickly when these get dull, and the razors from Gillette through Amazon take just as long to dull as do the razors from Gillette through the grocery store...this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.  This is the exact same product.  And, if you will still be shaving in a few months, do yourself a favor an subscribe for additional savings.    "

I got a set of sensitive heads because I have sensitive gums and never tried the other heads.  I like the sensitive heads.  Between flossing and brushing with this thing, my teeth feel almost as clean as walking out of a dentist office.  I used to see plaque build-up between visits behind my lower incisors.  This brush manages to clean that plaque away.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  In the past, I\'d occasionally see bleeding gums while flossing.  I haven\'t seen that recently.The toothbrush felt funny to use at first.  My teeth felt like they were \'buzzing\' a little after brushing.  I don\'t notice that any more.  The handle feels bulky, but I\'m able to maneuver it fine now and I can certainly clean more tooth surfaces with this brush than my old non-electric brush.  What\'s nice is that you simply have to position the brush properly and it vibrates to perform the cleaning.  I like the wireless timer that guides me through brushing 30 seconds in each quadrant.Set-up could have been easier.  Instructions were so-so and removing the back cover of the clock/timer was more difficult than it should have been.  But, day-to-day use is easy and rewarding.After using for 6 months, the wireless display became very finicky over batteries.  It goes haywire if the battery isn\'t fully charged.  The first set of batteries lasted 6 months.  I replaced with fresh energizers; they lasted only two months.  I checked the energizers with my multimeter and they register solidly in the \'good\' range---the batteries are fine."

I have written Amazon reviews for Oral-B products dating back to 2002. I have had very few dental issues in this time although, in fairness, I must also report that I began daily flossing during this time as well, and that may be just as important.This new model is a definite step up from the ancient \'Plak Control Plus\' model that I had been using. It\'s full name is \'Professional Care 3000\' and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument. The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one. Please note that this is not an ultrasonic toothbrush. Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action. The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth very quickly.The 3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button. The first is \'Daily Clean\' which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis. The second is \'Sensitive\' which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth. The third is \'Whitening\' which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \'Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\'The instructions that come with the 3000 recommend that you brush for 2 minutes - no less and no more. To assist you with this, once you turn the brush on it will pulse twice every 30 seconds. If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you\'ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times. To turn the brush off from any mode, just press and hold the on/off button.Built into the 3000 is a \'Hard Brushing Alert\' which is an LED on the handle that lights up if you are pressing too hard. Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth. Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly. The instructions say that the LED is, \'Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\' so apparently there\'s a dental health issue here as well. The brush is very powerful, so it\'s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.The brush comes with a charging stand and covered storage tray that can accommodate 4 brush heads. The storage tray is dishwasher-safe, the charging stand is not."

The Venus created no problems at all, even after several uses. There was no irritation, no cuts, and nothing missed. Just total, smooth comfort.

I visit my dentist every 6 months without fail (yes I have dental insurance and bi-annual cleanings are covered) and I have received nothing but praise from my dentist.I recently switched to this model becauser I became incredibly frustrated with the internal battery models dying 12 to 18 months after purchase. This was not due to mechanical failure as the build quality of this Made in Germany product is solid. However the Ni-Cad batteries cannot sustain charges well after prolonged use. I always disassemble the old brushes, remove the AA battery, and run it through a La Crosse charger using the full charge-discharge cycle which brings the battery back to life. However the disassembly of the brush does not permit for its reconstruction so all I am left with is a rechargeable AA Ni-Cad battery for use in other devices.The great thing about this brush is that it has the same great build quality but costs half the price. Additionally, it takes two AA batteries and the unit goes a week worth of brushing without charging while the internal battery models get 3 days maximum when new which slowly falls to every day before needing charging.In short, you get the same cleaning efficacy at half the cost with extended periods between charges. I am hoping that the product\'s life will also extend beyond 18 months further enhancing the benefits of this model versus any Oral-B/Braun model that can cost 10 times as much!!

The lubricating strip is a nice feature as it improves the gliding motion of the blade head and also acts like a blade wear indicator.

Upon brushing, it creates a back-and-forth spinning motion and a vibration that is akin to the polishing machine at the dentist\'s office.  There is no doubt that it is superior to traditional brushing in terms of effort to brush and how clean your teeth and mouth feel.  Given the relatively low-price, this could be an excellent option for some.However, I\'m a regular user of the Sonicare (I use the slightly older Elite series), and I can say that I prefer the Sonicare.  After several days of switching back and forth, it was clear to me that the Sonicare is simply better at brushing between teeth and getting the mouth to a clean feeling while being more gentle.  The Oral-B feels more like a polishing experience, whereas the Sonicare seems to get deeper between the teeth and gums and really get things clean.That being said, in reading the literature, it seems that the Oral-B products--at least the Professional Series--are superior to the Sonicare in terms of cleaning plaque (e.g., Biesbrock AR, Walters PA, Bartizek RD, Goyal CR, Qaqish JG. Plaque removal efficacy of an advanced rotation-oscillation power toothbrush versus a new sonic toothbrush. Am J Dent. 2008 Jun;21(3):185-8.).  I found this very interesting.  What I am not sure of, however, is whether or not this lower-priced Vitality line is the same as the more expensive professional series, and if not, how it differs.In sum, this is an excellent electric toothbrush that seems best suited for cleaning the surfaces of teeth extremely well.  I found it to be a little bit rougher and a little less capable of cleaning between the teeth and gums as the Sonicare (which has a larger head, softer bristles, and creates sort of a deep foaming feeling between the teeth).  Still, recommended indeed."

They increased the number of blades, but used cheaper and duller blades, so the end result was a lot of grabbing and pulling on my skin, something I never experienced with the Mach 3.  The construction was also cheap, I had a Fusion break apart on me after a year.  I\'ve never had a Mach 3 break, over 10+ years of use.The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  But the trimmer would get clogged with hairs, which is annoying.The Fusion Proglide replaces the Fusion\'s dull blades with sharp blades that don\'t tug or pull on my skin, they just glide through and cut as they\'re supposed to.

I\'ve also got the Gillette Fusion 5-blade shaver, and I definitely prefer 3 blades, especially for travel.  Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.    "

I always want to have good teeth for aesthetic reasons, and also because my mom invested so much in my teeth even though paying for braces twice wasn\'t so easy for her. I figure it\'s the least I can do, considering what she did for me.I have been wanting a rechargeable toothbrush for a long time, and I wanted the best I could buy in the Oral B line. I kind of thought that $100 was pretty high for a toothbrush, but they are offering the 50% rebate right now. When I get the rebate check, I\'ll really only have $50 in it. And that\'s not a bad price for a product that helps you keep your mouth healthier. I would have eventually bought this toothbrush at full price without a rebate, but the 50% rebate really pushed me to go ahead and buy it now.I got my toothbrush about 4 days ago, and I absolutely love it so far. I feel like it does a much better job than a manual toothbrush ever could. I\'ve been brushing in the Deep Clean mode, which is 3 minutes. Sometimes I even continue brushing for a minute or two after the 3 minutes on the Smart Guide has passed. My teeth feel so smooth when I\'m finished brushing; it\'s amazing.I love the Smart Guide that comes with this toothbrush. The timer really helps you see how long to brush in each quadrant before moving on to the next. I feel like I\'m getting a professional cleaning at home.I read a lot of reviews on here before making my purchase, which was very helpful. I did read a few reviews where people had said they experienced some bleeding from their gums, but I haven\'t had any trouble with that at all.So far, I\'m thrilled with this toothbrush and hope it continues to impress me. My twice yearly dental cleanings/checkups are always great, but I\'m really anxious for my next visit to see if the hygienist notices less plaque buildup, etc.If you\'re thinking about a rechargeable toothbrush, this is an excellent choice.

I\'m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  When you have teeth that are not straight like I do the back sides of your teeth are very hard to reach and the smaller round head on the brush I find reaches the hard to get areas better than the longer rectangular brushes.  Doesn\'t straighten your teeth though.  Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I\'m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  I tend to think that is glamor over substance.  After all the brush is just rotating in an oscillating motion purre and simple.  It works and works well.  My model hesistates at the end of two minutes and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  You still need to floss and thats expected.  I have been very pleased with my last unit.  I didn\'t save the box and the model number isn\'t on it so I cant say which one it is.  I\'ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  Good product and will continue to use till new technology comes up with something better.

I really can\'t see any movement of the razor when I look at it turned on, but he said he liked it a lot.  The razor itself has nice rubberized grips which help make sure it doesn\'t slip out of your hands. My husband already uses the regular Fusion blades and tested them out and they fit on the Proglide razor just fine.

Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife\'s mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a \'clean\' mode and a \'sensitive\' mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars."

It\'s one of those things that I don\'t like to do.  So when I bought this razor with its promises, I found myself waking up excited to see if the shaver was really a cut above the rest.I\'ve never used one of these battery razors but had wanted to.  The 5 blades scared me a bit too....ouch, would that really hurt!  To my surprise, and delight....the thing ROCKS!It does give a smooth shave and seems to save me time...to my surprise.  Like others have mentioned, it is a bit bigger so a bit tougher to get under the nose....but it\'s doable.  The extra edge blade on the top is kind of cool...but I have only used it a few times.I think the three things that make this work are (1), battery vibration, (2) part under the blade that hits your skin first before the blades do....seems to lift the beard so blades cut better and, (3) five blades...5 makes a difference but the big difference is the closeness of the blades.  It seems this closeness makes it less likely that the blades cut me.  I seem to get less razor cuts.The only drawback I can see is the cost...I have had a hard time justifying the cost of razors in the past...seem too expensive, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.I highly recommend you try it.  By the way, shaving in the shower for 22 years...only use a mirror half the time.  Way to go.  I also highly recommend Aveeno shaving cream.    "

Then I tried this DualAction brush head, and loved it even more in about 3 seconds.  Still do.  In fact, I recently ordered 5 of the 3-packs all at once because I\'ve had trouble finding them in stores and I was afraid they would stop making them or change the design.Now, it is true that at first it feels like you\'ve put one of those power floor scrubbers in your mouth, in that it feels kinda big and industrial until you\'re used to it.  But boy does it make your teeth and gums feel cleaner.  And I was accustomed to the different feel by the end of my first brushing with it.  If that sounds potentially troubling to you, I recommend just buying a one-pack the first time.  It\'s not cheap, after all, but for me it\'s been well worth the cost.  Do try it.I should also note that when I mentioned to my dentist that I\'ve been using this, she referred to it as a \'business killer.\'  I take that as another good sign."

1009,589,610,20061024,B000BUUVTY,5,"October 24, 2006",A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,Best shaver I\'ve ever had.,"I\'m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.    "

When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it\'s hard to continue shaving when there\'s hair worsening the blades\' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick.

Very happy!","First of all, a comment on the price...This is an amazing price for the Oral-B 5000. I just saw them yesterday (Jan. 15, 2011) at my local Target store for 159.00 with no rebate offers. So, getting one here through Amazon for under a hundred is a great buy! Not only was 96.00 a great price, but mine also came with a 50% mail-in rebate offer, which was a nice surprise. So, after that I will have only paid 48 bucks! Awesome! My girlfriend also got the rebate with hers. I don\'t know how long the rebates will last, but even without the rebate, this is an excellent price, and well worth every penny!After reading all the reviews here, and talking to my dentist about it and hearing his recommendation, my girlfriend took the plunge and ordered one a couple weeks ago. As soon as she tried it, she fell in love with it. She told me how good it felt on her teeth, and how clean her mouth felt after using it, and how she really looked forward to brushing. I immediately ordered mine the same day.My first impressions on the build quality...After opening and unpacking mine, I was immediately impressed with the build quality of the unit. The brush handle is solid and seems very well constructed, and the head that holds the brushes seems strong. I fully expect this to last a long time, and hold up really well. It\'s also attractive to look at, and the batteries last a long time on a full charge.This model comes with a separate wireless display unit, that displays brushing information while you\'re using it, and functions as a clock when you\'re not brushing. It displays a timer that will countdown from 2:00 minutes, or count up depending on your preference. It also shows the quadrants of your teeth for a visual reminder to make sure you get all areas. It displays which brushing mode you\'re using, and will flash a warning if you press too hard.Is the display really necessary? Perhaps not... The brush unit will vibrate each 30 or 45 seconds to remind you to change to the next quadrant. And it will stutter when the time is up to let you know you\'ve completed the recommended time. But, it is nice to have those visual cues where you can see them easily, and it is nice to have a small bathroom clock handy. So, I really like the display unit a lot. I think it was a nice addition, and I think most people will appreciate it.My impressions on actually using the brush...I\'ve had mine only a week so far, but I love it completely! I honestly think this is one of the best investments in my health I\'ve ever made. I\'ve never taken care of my teeth like I should have, and I have several fillings to show for it. I\'ve always tried to brush at least twice a day, but they were always short, quick brushes, by hand, and not very thorough. And I never thought I would be excited about brushing, until now.Now, I love brushing. I look forward to it. I brush at least three times a day, and never less than two minutes each time. I love how long the battery lasts, so I can take it with me to work, or on trips. This brush really makes it easy to stay on top of brushing. I can feel how thoroughly each tooth is getting cleaned, and it feels good on my teeth and gums. I haven\'t experienced any discomfort using mine.After brushing, my teeth are literally squeeky clean. It really does feel like a professional cleaning. It\'s only been a week with mine, but I can already notice a difference in their appearance. I\'m excited to see how they will look after a couple months.One last thing I really like is the carrying case that comes with it. It holds the brush firmly in place, and two brush heads firmly in place. Very convenient for carrying with me.This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I can\'t even imagine going back to a manual brush. I highly recommend this, and I\'m sure you will enjoy it just as much.Hope that helps..."

The timer and pressure warning feature are nice and the brush is much easier to keep clean than the Sonicare I used to use.  The only negative comment I can think of is that the brush head might be a little big for some people; I found brushing around my back molars a little difficult.

If you looked at my legs, you would see a road map of scrapes from past dalliances with razors. Many have come and gone. Frankly, I was often not even looking for quality - I was just looking for a quick, (relatively) fast way to remove unwanted stubble.Low and behold - I happened to read some reviews of Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, complete with 1 Razor and 2 Women\'s Razor Refill Cartridges. The women who used them seemed pleased, so, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring. Sure enough, the simply packaged product arrived at my home, just yesterday. In need of a touch up job, I decided to try my hand at this blade. I must say, I was very pleased. It didn\'t feel like I was even shaving! That was how smooth the razor glided down my legs, and under my arms. The moisture strip definitely did the trick. No ashy, flakey skin or the pain I come to associate with razor burn. The shave was close, too. I don\'t see stubble, after nearly twelve hours - which is unheard of, for me. I am from Lebanese/Latino/Indo European stock.

I then read the reviews here and see that a lot of people have this same problem. I called Oral-B support and they are not aware of any such problem but offered to send me a new brush head in the mail. It would take 2 to 3 weeks to get to me. I am taking this toothbrush back and never buying an oral-b brush again.

The Oral-B has one huge benefit over the SoniCare I was considering and that was the rotary action since the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750 also has \'sonic\' pulsations.  A lower-end Oral-B had the dual-action brushes, but wasn\'t \'sonic\'.  Did a bit more research on the Oral-B website and found this dual-action brush head to be compatible with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  This was just another huge advantage of the Oral-B over the SoniCare automatic toothbrush.  Since these dual-action toothbrushes weren\'t too expensive, I took a gamble and brought three 3-packs.  This was about 4-months ago, and I\'m still using the first one from my purchase.I definitely felt a cleaner difference from the dual-action brush head than the rotating brush head that came with my Oral-B.  The lateral vibrating brush not only help loosen gunk from your teeth, it also provides the surface area for the toothpaste, and an additional \'sonic\' surface.  With just the rotating brush head, I generally cannot finish brushing within the two-minute recommended brushing time and take at least 4 minutes.  With the dual-action brush head, I\'m able to do it in 2-minutes and my mouth feels much cleaner.  And my teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter.  I had cavity filings that were colored to match my yellowish teeth, and now I can clearly see that my teeth are a much whiter shade than my filings.  (This was without change in toothpaste, and actually reduced time in brushing).So what can be improved?  Three things.  One is the dual-action brush head is a bit thick, although not much thicker than the regular rotary brush heads.  Would be nice to have a flatter profile.  Second is that flossing action bristles should come on the rotary part of the dual-action brush head (like that on the rotary brush that came with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750).  And third, and the most important, is that the rotary part and the lateral vibrating parts of the dual-action brush head should be angled about 10 degrees to contour fit the curve of one\'s teeth.  This will optimize the contact surface at any time we\'re gliding the brush during brushing.  With these improvements, I would give it 5-stars... food-for-thought for any Oral-B employees reading this."

So every month for 5 days since I was ten, I\'ve had to suffer with basically a plastic diaper in my pants. The itchiness, the unbreathable plastic, the bulk. So a few months ago I got a sample of these in my regular box of pads, and all I can say is that I\'m hooked! No more plastic sticking to your butt. No more wet diaper feeling. No more bunching up in your underwear. No more wishing I was a bigger girl so that I could enjoy the freedom of tampons. The only thing that would make them better for me is if the had a wingless version, (I\'ve never really needed wings on my pads,) and a smaller, light flow day version. They are slightly longer (and wider in the rear) than the average pad but for me that is an improvement as I have felt that many pads available were too short, meaning I had to be careful how I sat/reclined when using one. Girls with heavy flows may still find these inadequate but as a moderate flow girl I find these to be better than the regular maxi pad. Did I mention They\'re so much more comfortable?

Maybe it does and it\'s just not working, but I\'ve never experienced such a smelly pad in such a quick amount of time. When the menstrual blood hits the air it produces a smell and we all know it. You need something to counteract that smell and these pads seem to do nothing for that. You\'d better be changing these pads half-hourly if you want to avoid the period smell. I would not wear this type of pad outside the home due to my insecurities about the lack of smell protection and the need to change them so frequently (due to smell) which is inconvenient.

It has a feature of three speeds which is very nice. when first turned on it is a regular speed, when the button is pressed again it goes to a slower speed designed for sensitive, when the button is pressed the third time it is a combination of regular and slow speed alternating radidly between the two. That is desined for more plaque removal. The problem is you have to go throuogh all three speeds to shut it off each use. Othe tan that it\'s a great brush. I\'d buy it again. R.L.B."

I had finally found something that protected me all day...Degree. I\'d get into work with my shirt looking like I\'d just went through a bit of a downpour, but my armpits were covered.So Degree is my standard of performance to which I judge the Gillette by.I also have a favorite scent of Degree (Power, which used to be Powder...But I\'m guessing the Marketing team thought men would have an easier time picking up Power). In essence my Degree serves as my antiperspirant and cologne.Using the Gillette is certainly different and away from the norm...Instructions state that the product should be applied before going to sleep and you\'ll be all set for the following entire day! Supposedly you could even take a shower and still be protected!As well, the stuff goes on clear and clean. The next morning you don\'t even know you\'ve got anything on, and it delivers on its\' promise of all day protection as well.This product really is an excellent antiperspirant, the only reason I didn\'t give it a full 5 stars is that I feel too high a premium is asked for this product. Even at the current sale price, I can get almost 2x more of my usual Degree antiperspirant at 1/2 the cost of just 1 of these Gillettes (yes, taking into account that this is a 2pack of Gillettes)!!If you don\'t mind the premium though, and you want something clean, clear and WORKS as promised...Then I wholeheartedly recommend this product.

Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand?

It has the dual heads that leave my mouth tasting fresh and clean and is far superior to the grocery store offering. To be sure it is much more expensive but the results, to me, are worth the extra cost. In addition to the dual head brush the timer is a nice touch and I have found that while it says the battery requires 16 hours to charge that apparently means to fully charge. I use the Vitality every morning and night during my travels and plug it in when checking into the motel room and find it always has an adequate charge.I agree with other reviewers that a travel case would be very handy as would a light indicating when the unit is charged. I am a bit worried about the battery used by OralB in this product after reading another reviewers comments as to the battery being of old technology and perhaps not as good as AA batteries. I intend to continue to use this unit extensively and will see how the battery performs.

My face was burning after my first shave and sprouted little red bumps. I wanted to make sure the razor was to blame and not something else so for the next two days I shaved my face half and half: Fusion on one side. Mach 3 on the other. On the second day I switched sides. The result? Every time I shaved, the burning side of my face had just been shaved by the fusion. The Mach 3 side was just fine.That burning sensation must me the shave was closer/better right? Wrong. Both sides of my face are equally smooth from both a visual and tactile inspection. The only difference is the burning.Conclusion: Don\'t buy into the hype. 3 blades are better than 5.    "

I have never been able to use Pantene products for my fine, curly hair, because they were too heavy, causing my hair to be turn out flat and limp.  I run into this a lot and am always on the lookout for products that claim to help.  I was looking for a new conditioner because the salon brand I loved, despite paying almost $50 for it, changed its formulation.  To my surprise, Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions is the one.  It smells nice going on, but avoids having a heavy, cloying scent that hangs around all day.  I can use a tiny amount (although that\'s par for the course with my hair).  Best of all, it does for my hair just what it says it will:  Allows my hair to maintain volume and hold its style.  Because I try so many different products looking for those that will work for me, I currently have five different conditioners in my shower.  One of them is my $50 one, and I usually reach for it second to the Pantene.  They work about equally well, but I can replace the Pantene for less than $5 - and I expect I will when it\'s gone. "

It comes with a handle and two razor cartridges. The razor handle will hold all Venus razor cartridges, not just the Spa Breeze ones. The entire package was very easy to open and the razor handle and cartridges come in a nice waterproof container that can be stored in the shower, although it\'s not all that sturdy. The package comes with a bracket so you can hang the razor in the shower, however, I couldn\'t figure out how to use it. While the razor cartridge packages are conveniently waterproof, I had a hard time opening them and ended up having to use scissors, which damaged the shaving gel bar a bit.The Venus Spa Breeze Razor was just okay. I love the fact that there is a scratch and sniff panel on the front of the package so you can smell the shaving gel to see if you like the odor and the white tea scent was very pleasant. You need to be careful how you store the razor in the shower especially if you can\'t figure out how to hang it - put the razor face down and the shave gel bars are activated and the razor becomes messy to use. The handle fits pleasantly into the hand and the cartridges snap on and off quite easily. The shaving gel bars are a unique feature and work quite well, but don\'t expect lather like from regular shaving cream. The razor provides a nice smooth shave although I did knick myself a bit, causing my leg to bleed.Venus Spa Breeze Razor is an interesting concept that is perfect for people that may be traveling and don\'t want to pack shaving cream. However, I\'m not sure how long the shave gel bars last, which makes me a bit wary. In the end, I prefer regular razors and shaving cream.    "

There were about two shaves worth of this in the sample I received. I used one and immediately threw the rest in the trash.It was like trying to shave with Crisco. It was very oily and hard to wash off my hands. It did the worst job of softening my beard of ANY shaving cream or gel I\'ve ever used, then after the shave, was equally difficult to completely wash the residue off my face.The (brand new) razor blade was left with this stuff gunked up between the blades as if I had run it through a can of solid Crisco shortening. I don\'t know how much hot water (VERY hot) I had to use before it finally all washed out of the blades, but it was far too much.The shave itself was similar to when I\'ve been caught on a trip without shaving cream and used bath soap to lather with, in that it makes it possible, but not comfortable. I\'d rather use bath soap to shave with than this stuff, and I\'m not exaggerating in making that statement.I have used Edge shaving gel for years. In contrast to this product, Edge does not leave an oily residue on my hands, does soften my beard (and my beard is a bit on the tough side), does not need intense scrubbing to remove from my face, and does not imbed itself into the razor blades. With Edge and a new blade, I never have any \'pull\' on a shave. My first, last, and only shave with this mess was an irritating pull on every shaving stroke (yes, with a brand new first time ever used blade).I\'m a big fan of the Fusion razors, but whoever invented this junk, and anyone else in the company that green-lighted it for sale, should be horse whipped.

I certainly don\'t mind, it\'s definitely for my benefit (no more grizzly bear)! :)Now for my husband\'s take: Even when he hasn\'t shaved in a week, this razor blades gives a smooth cut the FIRST time through... no more going over the same area two or three times because he has been lax in his shaving! This thing REALLY works, and works fast, and gives the ultimate cut while it\'s at it!!!  Really, really nice! He also loves the detailed cutter on the top of the blade to get precision cutting... comes in real handy!Overall, we both recommend it hands down, and we will be tossing the old razors away for this one... and paying the extra for the refills on this one... it is most DEFINITELY worth it!

In this case, though, I really wasn\'t a big fan.  Simply, I didn\'t find the product all that effective --  I would sweat right through it, where I wouldn\'t with other similar products.  I also found the smell a little too strong at times.  I like the anti- perspirants / deodorant combo, but in this case I found the anti- perspirants a little less effective than I needed, and the deodorant a little more than I wanted.I also found that this product leaves a weird film, which doesn\'t easily wash off.  I regularly find in the shower that it\'s still slick / hair matted from where I applied the product previously.  Not particularly cool.  Many (but not all) other products like this don\'t leave this sort of residue, or at least not as much as this one does.  My 2-cents at least.One nice thing about this product I definitely noticed -- they give you a fair sized stick of it.  I hate spending $3-4 on a stick of this stuff and running out shortly after.

Well...for the first time in the history of mankind...there\'s truth in advertising. OK, that\'s a bit of exaggeration on my part, but to be perfectly honest, it actually is the best razor that I have ever used...hands down. I usually only shave once a week (to my family\'s dismay), so my stubble is quite long. I use to have to trim down my semi-beard with an electric razor and then shave, but now I use the ProGlide and it literally \'glides\' through my stubble for a nice clean shave. I also like how the stubble doesn\'t get caught in between the blades. I use to have to bang the razor against the side of the sink to get the captured stubble hairs to come out of the razor, but those days are now long gone.If anyone is reviewing replacement blades (as I am doing here), there should be no question as to the satisfaction of the product (proved by the continuing purchase of the product).

At night I set it on the 3 minute deep clean setting which then makes me want to follow up with flossing to get maximum clean! I\'m sure I have never spent 3 minutes brushing my teeth prior to having the wireless timer that comes in the box. The handle feels very substantial in my hand, runs very smoothly, and holds its charge for several days. I previously had the cheaply made $30 Oral-B unit and I disliked using it so much that I\'m sure I hurried to finish and did not clean my teeth very well. It vibrated too much and the brush head was way too small. The SmartSeries 5000 is a joy to use.

Gillette\'s earlier products will clean you up just fine, not to mention comparable razors and blades manufactured by the Other Guys.But if you want close to mean \'as close as it currently gets\', you might want to invest in the Fusion (a small investment) and the replacement blades (a large one).I have often suffered an irritated face while shaving with a blade, one of the reasons I moved to a beard and an electric shaver some years ago. But so far, in the thick of the Midwestern winter, I have yet to feel any irritation.The battery-powered, chip-driven gizmo may be overkill, I must admit. I seem to get as good a shave from the Fusion with the power off as with the little hummer humming away.Factor in the cost of the blades.

This toothbrush wowed me from the moment that I took it out of the box. First I have to point out that it comes FULLY CHARGED. Since when does an electronic item arrive at your door without needing charging? I was able to take it out and to use it immediately! The next thing I noticed was how much lighter it was than my three year old sonic toothbrush. It was more slender, shorter, and much, much more comfortable to hold. When I pulled the base out of the box I was simply astounded - how could something so small be a charger? I\'d been used to this huge base and now all I had to deal with was this tiny little thing, barely big enough to fit the base of the brush, but it did and it was extremely sturdy as well.The big challenge, though, was the brushing. My Vitality had a 2 minute warning feature on it, where it sort of stutters in the vibrations when two minutes is up. I loaded up the toothbrush with toothpaste and started the brushing. I could immediately notice the difference from my new Oral-b to my old sonic toothbrush, as this one rotated instead of just going up and down. I could simply gently guide the brush from one tooth to another, just like my dentist does, and the teeth were getting cleaned!Two minutes actually took much longer than I thought, and I was a bit ashamed to realize that I hadn\'t been brushing a whole two minutes for quite awhile! But eventually the stuttering happened and I turned off the brush and looked closely to see what the cleaning had done.WOW. Not only did the brush get in between a lot of my teeth to get some things that would normally be gotten by flossing, but it also polished my teeth as well! I was able to run my tongue around my teeth and was shocked to realize that my teeth felt exactly the same way after my home cleaning as it does after I\'m done a visit at the dentists.I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and am interested in the different heads that you can get to go on the toothbrush!

For someone who dreads shaving because every excursion results in a bloody nick, this razor changed my view entirely.The handle attaches to the head at the bottom, leaving the head to swivel naturally with each body curve.  Most razors have the handle attaching at the top of the razor so mobility is limited.For the first time since I started shaving my legs, I did not come away with nicks, cuts, or scrapes.  The multiple blade head seems to float over the turns and curves of the body and gives a close shave with little pressure.I also liked the enclosed shower pod which holds the additional blades and keeps them dry yet handy.  Nothing worse than having to leave the shower to get a new razor.  The pod has stuck in its original place so I haven\'t had problems with it falling off the tile as have other reviewers.Overall, there isn\'t anything I can say that I didn\'t like.  So, for women who have tried waxing, lotions, or other razors, give this a try.  I don\'t think you\'ll be disappointed.  No fuss, straight forward and no PAIN!    "

They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft.

The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  The brushing unit is waterproof so no worry about getting water or moisture on it. There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush. The unit uses a rechargeable battery, which the company claims can not be over charged, so you can store the brushing unit on the electric charger unit.I have used both a Phillips and Oral-B electric toothbrush and find that this rechargeable model does a comparable job in the cleaning of my teeth. I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back teeth.The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth. The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums. The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off. The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.The brushing bristles give an indication by fading in color to show when it should be replaced. I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package. Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long but it looks very similar to the brushing head I have used on my Oral-B electric toothbrush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model."

There are definitely both better and worse shampoos out there, depending on what you spend.We both agreed that the most annoying part of it was the packaging.  The cap is hard to open, especially with wet hands.  The cap is also a weird recessed design that collects water, but then has drainage holes in it.  It seems to collect/dribble shampoo around the cap (which makes it more slippery) and will likely get funky towards the end of the bottle. "

I have resisted this purchase for years, but it has become apparent that I really needed to get one.  Research indicated that this was the best brush as far as effectiveness.I\'m not all that excited about vibrating toothbrushes--reminds me a lot of going to the dentist.  But this really isn\'t so bad.  I was a little skeptical--but after feeling the \'dentist clean\' feeling, I was sold.  I love that the brush stops if i try to brush too hard.  the little display that shows the quadrants and how long you are brushing is a little helpful--although certainly not a selling feature in my book.  funny though, i found as did many reviewers, that this serves as a great bathroom clock!The information on amazon can be a bit confusing.  You get a travel case, charger, 2 brush tips (1 pro white and 1 floss), and the display.The handle is a bit on the large size and i\'m not sure it would be good for children.  I prefer smaller handles, however, they can\'t fit all that computer programming into a smaller handle.You do have to practice a bit at keeping your mouth closed enough that the toothbrush doesn\'t spray.  But it has never been a real issue for me--i would say any spray has been minimal.  And every electric toothbrush has this issue.I prefer the smaller brush head on these to the larger brush heads.  on normal toothbrushes I prefer full size brush heads--but when you have a large handle, it seems much more maneuverable to have the smaller head.  And it doesn\'t feel stranger or bother me--i adapted on first use.When you are done using, it is best to remove brush from handle and thoroughly run it under water.  This can prevent toothpaste from building up.Oral B has a 60 day try it guarantee and will refund your money if you are not happy.  That seems like a good deal."

I\'ve used the previous Fusion Power razors in the past with great results.  The cartridges are expensive, so I\'ve alternated between the Fusion and a Merkur safety razor with Feather blades.  When I want a really close shave and don\'t have a lot of time to spend shaving, I opt for the Fusion.  It requires less preparation time for my beard and I don\'t have to be nearly as careful while shaving.  Also, typically one pass does the job with the Fusion.As for the new model, the Proglide, there are improvements.  They\'ve created better spacing between the blades to help keep the razor from clogging.  I think this also improves drying, which should lengthen the life of the blades.  I don\'t care how much, or what kind of coating they put on the blades, they will eventually rust.  It seems also that the trim blade is improved.  It\'s very handy for getting the tight spots, like right under your nose.  That\'s a problem area with a safety razor and certainly with a Mach 3.  All in all, this is a great razor and one that I would use every day if the replacement blades weren\'t so expensive.

I was beginning to think that the competition to create a razor with the largest number of blades was getting ridiculous. I starting shaving my legs with the original single blade razors which did often cause embarrassing scrapes and cuts. The twin blade was a much heralded advance that resulted in a better shave and less abrasions. I even bought into the triple blade and was impressed, but  I drew the line at the quattro. This was getting ridiculous. Soon we would not have to move the instrument more than a millimeter to shave an entire calf. Come on!?The free vine product enticed me to try the Embrace five blade razor and its a winner. The shave was safe and incredibly smooth. I like the idea of the replaceable cartridge in the comfortable and light weight plastic handle. The case that suctions to the shower wall is a cute extra but not a reason to purchase this razor. Its performance, however, is definitely  worthy of the purchase price.    "

She used her three blade razor on one leg and this on the other, and, on a blind test, I determined that the leg shaved with the three blade razor felt smoother.  And the Venus Embrace left her other leg looking red and irritated -- it felt a little roughed up.  My wife pointed out that the huge \'moisturizer\' surrounding the blades makes it impossible to do any fine trimming.  Also, she didn\'t like the shower mount or the amount of packaging on the \'shower safe\' replacement blade.  It seems wasteful.  And who changes the blade in the shower instead before starting the water?  Sometimes less is more, and fewer than five blades certainly seem do to a better job for shaving.

But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  While Gillette\'s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  Where I know some bumps on my cheeks and chin should be, the vibration may confuse me and cause me to improperly shave and leave some spots thicker than others.The blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I\'m considering doing the ol\'-fashioned wet shaving.All in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.

But even under the best of circumstances, the volume just does not last. This shampoo claims to be formulated to give fine hair that much needed boost, which, when used with other products in the line, will last all day.As a shampoo it is just fine.  It lathers nicely and has a pleasant light fragrance. (The hair gods have truly cursed me..in addition to stubborn, wavy fine hair, my hair only holds obnoxious odors like cigarette smoke and the awful fried smell from grills.  So fragrance usually is not an issue for me.)  The shampoo did remove the product I had used previously and left my hair soft, shiny with nice body.  I did not notice any significant difference from this shampoo as opposed to any other.  Obviously, super clean hair has more volume and bounce than hair not in its first freshness.  I did also try it with a sample size of the conditioner and root lift and must say that the volume held, but again not significantly more so than when I use other light conditioners and root lift.

My wife has tried many different razors, many of them from the Venus line, and this one is about average.I\'ll try to just accentuate the nehative aspects she encountered, as most people seem to be more interested in that type of feedback. The three-blade design is a bit dated, and the razor itself it a bit bulky, making the whole thing a little awkward.  After 3 uses, the mousture gel bar fell off, rendering the razor\'s intended purpose useless.  Other than this, this razor does produce a smooth shave and minimizes razorburn.  Unfortunately, the blades do seem to get gunked up and don\'t rinse out easily.Overall, I give it an average review.  My wife prefers the Intuition, but says that this Venus ProSkin is \'about the same\' and ended up buying the refills.  Check your local paper for coupon savings on the refills.    "

5774,2601,2664,20100906,B003UKKH6O,4,"September 6, 2010",AC24H4N4HYNU5,Nicely priced for a first-time user of an electric toothbrush,"This is my first electric toothbrush. I am extremely happy with it. I would recommend it as an entry-level electric toothbrush to those who are too unsure about the technology to pay for one of the more higher priced models.Full disclosure: I received this toothbrush free as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, at the low cost of $29.99 I probably would\'ve bought it anyway. I think it is definitely worth that price for a first-time electric toothbrush.PROSCLEANING: My teeth get much cleaner when I use this toothbrush versus my traditional one. They feel smooth, just like I came from the dentist. Flossing also seems easier while using this toothbrush because, with the right tilt on the brush, it is better able to clean between my teeth and at the gum line, so there seems to be less tartar buildup when I floss.WHITENING: The stain removal is EXCELLENT. My teeth are not that stained, but during the 2 weeks I\'ve been using this brush, I\'ve noticed a *significant* decrease in the yellow stains near my gum line.BATTERY: This may sound odd, but I liked the way the battery ran out. I was a bit concerned about what would happen and how I would handle it (the instructions give no clue). It pretty much just stops working, no wind-down at all. I liked that because it left no mystery as to \'will it or won\'t it\' finish and I just finished brushing my teeth with it manually. I\'ve used this toothbrush 1-2 times per day for over 2 weeks now, and I\'ve only had to charge it once.REPLACEMENTS: The brush indicates when it needs to be replaced via color loss on the bristles (just like some traditional toothbrushes do). It does come with an extra head, as well as a $3 coupon for another one.CONSDROPLETS: The only negative on this toothbrush is probably just due to my inexperience with electric toothbrushes: it sprays toothpaste droplets onto my clothing. Now I try to brush my teeth before I dress, or else I drape a hand towel over my blouse while brushing.VIBRATIONS: As others have mentioned, the vibrations are INCREDIBLY strong on this toothbrush. You should NOT press it hard against your teeth; just lay it gently onto them and let the brush do the work for you. My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive (I have several cracked ones) and once I stopped pressing with the brush, I had no problems with pain due to the vibrations. However, the vibrations DO make my nose ticklish.Unlike other reviewers, I have NOT experienced any \'gunk\' buildup in the toothbrush stand because I always rinse off my toothbrush the way the instructions say to. (If you put ANY toothbrush back in its holder without rinsing it well enough, you\'re going to get \'gunk.\')Overall, I would recommend this as a fine first electric toothbrush, especially at this price point."

Even the boxes have evidence of being machine-glued, and not hand-glued.

I can\'t get that with any other electric or non-electric toothbrush. The better a product is, the harder I evaluate it and the more nit-picky I become, so here go the suggested improvements: First, the recommended cleaning time is 2 minutes which I believe is way too short. I double that by brushing the lower and upper jaw, each using the times for my entire mouth. Last, the controls are too easy to accidentally hit. This causes the toothbrush to go into another cleaning mode when you didn\'t want it to. I don\'t know how you can fix this except to be careful when holding the toothbrush and not accidentally hit one of the two buttons on the handle. I imagine if they located the controls elsewhere, or made them more difficult to press, I would be complaining about the ergonomics! Maybe a lockout on the end of the brush would help?

We found that the battery is long lasting so you don\'t need to charge it after a few brushes. the grip is comfortable and its easy on the wrist! every time I brush I get the same feeling as i do when i go to my dentist for my six month cleaning. My dentist even said this is the best one on the market right now. Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well. bottom line don\'t hesitate to buy this model (dental professional exclusive 5000 series) because it an investment that will pay off."

You could say it is a hybrid trac II.In my opinion, putting more blades on is a scam for you to buy more blades at a higher cost, keep in mind these are aluminium sharpened fine and coated for comfort, wrapped in plastic to attach at the head.Multi blades are going to last longer, common sense should tell you though, to put another 1-2-3 more blades in a razor shouldn\'t drive the cost up another $20.00 to $30.00.So as not to get off track, this razor system is great, the regular blades provide a close shave, the handle is at such an angle you can see those hard to get to places such as nose, sides, jawline.The sensor blades which are a little better, can provide a comfortable shave for people with more sensative skin, I find using barbasol with aloe or something comparable will give a close shave yet not have that burn afterward.My shave routine consists of:1.  cold water splash on the face, this tightens the pours of the skin and makes the whiskers stand up a little better.2.  I use barbasol regular, it\'s cheap, it\'s foam, and it does the job.3.  where you start is up to you, I usually start right to left going with the flow of the whiskers.  Never go against the grain as this will give you bumps (pseudofoliculitis barbae)and that can be a little uncomfortable or not look so good on that hot date or job interview.4.  after I shave i jump in the shower, however, if you don\'t always rinse.  This gets the cream off and any sediment such as left over whiskers and keeps them from entering skin pours and causing irritation, a big pimple or a serious infection.5.  Now, this is optional and I would recommend this for guys starting to shave.  Try some after shave lotion, it soothes the skin so you don\'t have that burn feeling all day, it also tightens the pours so you have a smooth shave longer and the girls appreciate a man that smells good and has a smooth face.i hope this helps some of you, pick what works for you.By the way gillette, I bet you are losing money on your blades, try lowering the prices for the everyday guy to afford to shave.

I know most people don\'t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn\'t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!Ok now for the research details:1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it\'s time to brush on another side.6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you9. It\'s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn\'t like to brush or doesn\'t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH.

More importantly, it hasn\'t caused any skin irritation--unlike many prescription-strength products, it doesn\'t contain the active ingredient, aluminum chloride, which has been known to cause underarm irritation.

However I got the razor and 1 blade free in the mail and gave it a try.  I have been using the same blade for 4 weeks now and I love this thing.  I feel like that thing performs wonderfully well.  The shaves are close and it has minimized the need for shaving in reverse which i need to do.  Also i feel that the strips on this last longer because i still get that squeeky clean and smooth feeling each time.  Another big plus is how easily the hair is cleaned from this blade.  The running water removes all hair thanks to the design that leaves the front and back of the blades fully exposed.  I must say that this product exceeded my expectations.  However, i have taken off a star due to its expensive blades (almost $3.50 per blade, retail). When i go back to my original shaving system, i will decide if this price is worth paying but somehow i doubt it    "

With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh. The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline. It\'s not a substitute for flossing, but an additional help. My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven\'t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power. If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better. I\'m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea). The charge lasts for about a week, depending on how often it\'s used. For around $30, this powerful toothbrush is an excellent value."

I brook down and bought the version with the SmartGuide. My thought was what the heck even though I thought I did not require it. I have say that there have been times when I would have stopped brushing before 2 minutes are up because I thought 2 minutes had gone by. Note that the toothbrush pulsates every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants and pulsates three times at the two minute mark, so you don\'t really need the SmartGuide. It is still nice to check while brushing and the clock is a nice feature as well. For Christmas I got my wife the same toothbrush, but it now seems to be called the 5000. I have to say it is hard to figure out all the models and sets Oral-B creates. I told my wife that when you first use the toothbrush you will feel as if your teeth are going to shake right out of your mouth and she agreed. After a couple of uses, you become totally use to the brush. I have read negative reviews in which people stated this toothbrush makes their gums bleed, I can only assume they have gum problems and brushing action was too much for their gums. Without a doubt my teeth are much cleaner with this brush. I am not always good about flossing, and I would notice that when I got around to flossing again after period of not flossing that my gums were sore the following day. I noticed tarter build up as well. With the Triumph/5000, I never notice these problems now. Of course this toothbrush is not a substitute for not flossing, but I feel it really helps if you don\'t always floss. Our kids have now used our toothbrushes as well for the last few months and most importantly they are brushing for a full two minutes. Prior to this my son was closer to bushing for 10 seconds than 2 minutes. I figured too that the newness of the brush would have worn off with them, but they still seem to like it. Battery life is good as well. I get about 11 days between charges, but I also brush between 2.5 minutes and 3 minutes every time I brush. With that factored in I would say a 2 minute brusher would get pretty close to 2 weeks on a charge. Bottom line is this is a great product. So much so that I hauled it with me on an 8-day trip to Europe, and it went in my backpack not my checked luggage. I still take a manual toothbrush on overnight trips, but I sure hate not having this toothbrush with me."

The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior/interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes some adjustment on the part of the operator.  I found that my gums could handle the Sonicare, but my girlfriend gums are more sensitive and she uses this Oral-B exclusively.  The motion of the brush is much more softer and the replaceable brushes tend to fit right over each tooth.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  I like having the ability to brush my tongue which is much more difficult with this brush."

The included 5-blade razor is quick and sharp by itself, but when you couple it with the vibrating powered trimmer handle, you actually do get an even closer shave, even though it took me a few shaves to get used to the feeling.  The back of the 5-blade razor has a \'precision edging blade\' that lets you precisely shape and edge your sideburns.  Sometimes, depending upon how much I have let my sideburns grow out, I find it easier to just use the powered trimmer without either the razor or comb attachments and using the trimmer by itself does a great job of shaping my sideburns with crisp clean lines.

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

The shaver is smooth on the skin, down\'t cut or nick even in tough spots like behind the knee or in the back of the ankle, and it shaves better and faster. To my surprise, I also found it to be much gentler on the skin, and can be used comfortably without the shaving gel - which is a plus because the gel makes shaving much messier and longer and shortens the life of the blade.Well done to Gillette. Now, if they could only make the packaging a bit more eco-friendly!

Anyone who leaves an exposed razor in the shower, held by a pod wih suction cups, who has kids, is, of course, insane. I suppose I see the appeal of the pod for childless people, who want a razor which has a station where it can be \'docked\' to air-dry conveniently, and there IS a good spot for the extra cartidges to be stored inside.The pod looks like a small space ship or a mini house designed by a famous architect, or possibly it just resembles an egg.

By far the Gillette Proglide is the best safety razor I have ever used and I have been shaving for over 50 years.But, to get the best shave with this razor or in fact, any razor you should follow these simple techniques:1.  Get a shower mirror, not that expensive, and shave in the shower at the end of your routine, make sure water is running and at a pretty good temperature.  The longer you stay in the shower before shaving the softer your beard will be and easier to shave.2.  Get yourself a bottle of Baby Oil, doesn\'t have to be Johnson&Johnson\'s any brand will do, even Walmart\'s brand.  I tried the Baby Oil gel, but it\'s too messy and gooey.  Just plain old Baby Oil.  Step away from the shower and put a good amount of oil on your face and neck. Rub it in as best as you can to make sure your beard is pretty saturated with the oil, you don\'t have to over do it, but just make sure you have enough oil on your face that you know it\'s there.3.  Shaving cream.  So far the best I have found is Aveeno\'s Therapeutic Shaving Gel. Available everywhere just about. Apply the the shaving gel OVER the oil that you put on your face.4.  That\'s it! Shave now like you would normally with your Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor.  You will not believe the closeness of your shave, plus your face is being nourished somewhat when using the Baby Oil.  The oil makes the razor glide smoothly over your face and actually lubricates the shaving blades, MAKING THEM LAST A LOT LONGER THAN IF YOU DID NOT USE THE OIL.Summary:  I change the Gillette Fusion Proglide blades once a month, honest.  Once a month! And I shave about 5 to 6 times a week.  Getting 20 to 25 shaves is nothing using this technique.  I probably could go longer than once a month, but can\'t be too cheap, lol.Hope someone tries this.  The combination of the Baby Oil and using Aveeno\'s shaving cream makes this all work in my opinion.  It\'s not that expensive to try if you already are using the Gillete Fusion Proglide razor.    "

I have tried, bought, or sampled just about everything out there except a straight razor.  I even have a very expensive safety razor \'kit\' I purchased from an internet supplier of shaving supplies.  The most expensive razor felt like I was using a Samurai sword on my face and it simply did not work as well as these Gillette Custom Plus pivoting razors did.  Again, maybe they just work well for \'my face\', i\'m not sure, but these work well for me.  Very comfortable, reasonably priced (about $1.30 a razor), and the longest use I get from a razor before I have to throw them away.  I would dare say (from my experience) that these razors use the exact same \'head\' or \'cartridge\' on them as the Gillette \'Sensor 3\' Razors which also work very well for me.  I always seem to come back to either the Custom Plus or Sensor 3 (both by Gillette) and again I think they use the exact same cartridge on top (triple blade) but they have a different shaped handle.  Thats the only difference between them.  I usually get about 7 to 10 days of shaving with these.  Other disposables give me 3 to 5 days before becoming very dull and unusable for my face.  Make sure you flush the blades out with water and let the razor dry after use for the best result and longest days of use.  Another trick with these (or any razor for that matter) is a high quality shave cream.  I\'m not talking about these \'foams\' or crap like that.  You know what i\'m talking about.  Get yourself a good quality shave cream in a jar and a badger hair brush to apply it with.  I know, some people may think i\'m crazy or something, but trust me on this one.  The badger hair brush (GOOD QUALITY ONE!) may cost you about $35 or up.... in price.  It will last a LONG TIME (years) if you take care of it and shake it out and dry it each day.  A good quality shave cream (such as something from Crabtree & Evelyn or Sephora, or ULTA will set you back between $20 to $30 a jar, tube, or tub but you use very little each day by applying it with the Badger hair brush you purchase and it will last forever trust me.  When I say it will provide you with a super close shave, I mean closer than using a cheap foam or gel.  I was about 40 years old when I finally broke down and bought a good quality Badger brush (after seeing reviews about them on-line) and I was so happy I did it I will never go back to those junk foams or gels that cost $2 at Walmart or similar locations.  You wouldn\'t think it would make that much of a difference, but trust me, IT DOES!!!!!  It just simply makes a difference, period.  Coupled with the Gillette Custom Plus razors and a good quality shave cream and Badger Hair brush, you\'ll have a great shave that is very close, even if you have a coarse beard like mine.  Happy shaving my friends!    "

When I finally spotted it, I imediately purchased it, took it home and tried it.  So, does this razor live up to the hype?When I came home and took the razor out of the package I was glad to see that the battery (1-AAA battery) was included but I was a little put off that it only came with one razor cartridge.  I figured from past experience that there would be two but only one???  The razor itself has a decent weight and a nice shape so I quickly got over the fact that there was only one cartridge.I brought the razor in the shower, washed my face and applied my shaving gel and was preparred to be wowed.  I turned the razor on and it came to life with a solid hum.  The power button on it seems to be better than the M3Power\'s because it protrudes a little less and it seems less likely to be accidently turned off while you\'re shaving.  That being said, I began to shave.  The first thing I noticed about the razor was the size of it\'s head.  It seems rather large in comparison to the M3Power or even the Schick Quattro blades.  Even though it did seem bigger, it didn\'t seem awkwardky big and I was still able to shave without it being cumbersome.  The razor cut clean and smoothly though my beard and gave quite a comfortable shave.  The blades easily rinsed under running water even though they are spaced quite closely to each other.  I noticed on a few of my problem spots I still had to take multiple passes with the razor so in spite of having five blades, it couldn\'t perform miracles!  There was the single trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge too but it really didn\'t seem to be very functional.Overall I was quite satisfied with the quality and comfort of the shave.  The question that I have now is that, in spite of a good shave, is this razor worth the extra price versus say, the M3Power or the Schick Quattro?  Locally the refils go for about 30% more than the other \'older\' razors so, there is a signifigant price difference?Personally, I\'ll continue to use this razor for a little while and look for the cartridges to be on sale but I honestly don\'t think the Fusion\'s shave is that far superior to either the M3Power or the Schick Quattro to justify paying that much extra.

I like that it\'s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison.  On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare.  And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general.

And for me, comparing this Pulsonic to the Triumph... well, there\'s just no comparison.  The Triumph is better by far.  Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you\'re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.I\'ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it\'s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won\'t last long.  I can bring my Triumph on a 10 day vacation without the charging unit (and I brush twice a day.)  I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn\'t have a big enough battery to do that.

The brush system was easy to set up and the two replacement heads were just what was needed to get the brush up and running.The 2 minute timer sets up the system to allow adequate time to clean teeth and gums.  No pressure is needed to get your pearly whites cleaned and ready for the day and my son certainly enjoys his time with the toothbrush now.  I just need to pick up an additional head so I can have three, one for each child.I highly recommend this to anyone that needs a great refreshing way to brush your teeth and gums."

What I found is that the Vitality has a lot more power -- judged by the vibrations in my head -- plus it\'s even lighter weight, has replaceable heads, and a timer.Lighter weight is good, as are the replaceable heads because that means the whole family can use one base, and you can replace the toothbrush-head after flu or colds.More power should mean that it cleans better.  What I found is that my mouth felt \'cleaner\'... BUT, after I let my teeth \'go\' and get rather \'grotty\' for test reasons, the Vitality didn\'t seem to clean any better in those hard to reach between teeth spots, than it\'s cheaper cousin.  To be honest, I\'m not sure what to make of this observation.  I tried the cheaper cousin after that, plus a standard toothbrush, and nothing worked except floss -- thank heaven -- so perhaps my expectations are too high and no brush would accomplish this task.THE SKINNY:::We will be switching to this Oral B toothbrush and the reason is that I think it\'s more cost effective for us than cheaper Oral B battery operated models that we are currently using.  Though more expensive initially, you can purchase replacement heads so the whole family can use one base.I like the timer.  I thought only the kids would benefit, but to my surprise I wasn\'t brushing long enough either.It doesn\'t remove plague like claimed, but it definitely has more power than our comparison Oral B\'s, and made my mouth feel cleaner.I liked that the brushes were NOT rock hard.  Rock-hard is not good for the gums.Pam T~mom and blogger"

I can walk out of the room, even, and it continues to time me.

The Sensor Excel is really the best. The problem is it got so expensive, in a large part because the 5 blade razors were hugely expensive and Gillette/P&G couldn\'t have an old product that worked so well so much cheaper.  At least with Amazon\'s auto ship it makes the blades reasonable.  Perhaps the crowd at P&G are responsible for these ridiculous new models out now with 6 blades (5 for the face and 1 for under the nose).

Although I thought the five blades were a gimmick and put off trying it, I really do like it better than the previous Excel razors.  The \'precision\' blade on the top rear side is much more convenient than I would have expected, allowing me to get a good line on my side burns.  The blades last over a month for me, and I shave every other day on average (full beard growth, just sensitive skin).  When the Proglide Power razor went on sale for less than a new Fusion cartridge would cost me, I decided to give it a try.  Yeah, that was a no brainer.  :)  I liked the shave, and I decided to stick with it for another eight cartridges when this package went on sale.In my opinion, these aren\'t a big advance over the Fusion Power.  In fact, it doesn\'t seem much if any different to me.  The Fusion Power worked very well, and so does this.  These give a clean shave with minimal effort, even when I recently went five or six days without shaving over vacation.I was disappointed when the bottom glide strip on my first Proglide cartridge came loose.  I have never had a problem with a Fusion Power cartridge.  The two Proglide cartridges since then have held up nicely, though, so I think/hope it was an anomaly.So, I recommend giving these a try if you\'re unhappy with your current razor.  I do think that the Fusion Power are just as good, and they can probably be found for less money because they are the previous model, so you might want to try those first.    "

This time my hygienist broke downand recommended the Vitality, which I found for less than $30.  I wasvery glad to see that this generation of electric brushes doesn\'trequire a big box, just a small recharger.The instructions were a bit confusing, and there was no clearindication of there being a timer or how to use it.  The word \'timer\'is printed near the on/off switch, however.  The first time I used thebrush I was about 75% done when the brush pulsed for a second. Ithink that\'s the \'timer\'.  That has continued to happen every time Ibrush with it.

485,65,68,20110909,B000052YIN,3,"September 9, 2011",A3WAQEX5H4F3A,A perspective from someone who prefers shaving gel...,"I made the mistake of purchasing this product, and meant to get the Gillette Series gel.  I didn\'t know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too.  Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!).  I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I\'ve used in the past.  However, as other reviewers have noted, it\'s not as \'rich\' or full-bodied when it comes out of the can.  The \'instructions\' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams).  Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it\'s good foam, and I\'d give it a higher rating if it wasn\'t for the \'watery\' consistency when it comes out of the can.  This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).In summary:* If you like foam, you may like this one.  3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won\'t like it.  However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you\'d like it.    "

I thought the shave gel strips would make the razor not shave close or that the shave gel strips wouldn\'t really be able to take the place of shave gel.  Then, I gave it a shot.  Wow!  The shave gel strips are quite effective and the razor shaved as close as any razor without the strips.  On purpose, I didn\'t use lotion or anything after shaving my legs to see if there would be any kind of razor burn from not using a shave cream, soap, etc.  Nothing!The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was due to what you get for the price.  The package says it is a one count, but goes on to say there are two of the head pieces included.  In other razors, this would typically mean there is one full razor (handle and head piece) and two refill head pieces.  On this, you get one handle and two head pieces.  At $10.99 a package, that makes these $5.50 each which is pretty pricey for a ladies razor.  I\'m also a little concerned that the life of the razor might be short because once the strips are gone, it is just a plain razor.  I\'ll have to update to let everyone know how long the strips lasted.UPDATEUnfortunately, this razor didn\'t stand the test of time.  The first shave was great.  The second was okay, but the strips were drying up.  On the third shave, one of the now dried up strips fell off.  On the second razor in the pack, it lasted about five shaves before one of the strips fell off.  So, I can\'t recommend this product.    "

First, when using on your legs, I have to admit it\'s really great. I found the shave to be close and my legs were amazingly smooth after using it (almost as if I had used some kind of baby lotion or shaving cream on my legs). However, when I tried to use it on my underarms and bikini area, I found the stips as well as the pivoting factor of the razor design, to make it awkward and almost impossible to get a good shave.

The shave cannot leave spotty stubble, and the blade can\'t dull after 2-3 attempts either.These Fusions are the best blades I\'ve used for the task. I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face. The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.Even with a week\'s growth on the head, the blade is up to it (granted, I\'m pretty bald, so we\'re not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here). It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that\'s needed.The one flaw is not the blade\'s fault - but it\'s still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you\'re using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.I\'ve cut myself quite a few times, usually on the fingers when I\'m switching hands, or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick. It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot. It can be the kind of cut you\'ll actually need to pay attention too.Other blades can cut too, of course, but this razor\'s series of blades will make it quite a bit worse. If it was just my face, I probably wouldn\'t make the mistake, but since I\'m shaving my head I can\'t always see what I\'m doing, and that can be the problem. I\'ve never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.That is not the blade\'s fault - it\'s mine! But I can\'t imagine I\'m the only one whose done this. I know we\'re all careful with blades, but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.But - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised. If you need a clean shave for thick stubble, this should work for you.    "

Applied Gillette Fusion shaving cream and tested it next to my old Fusion. No difference, what so ever. The \'larger handle\' is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size. The shave was no closer, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide. Having said that, I can\'t complain, they sent it too me for free.It\'s an excellent marketing ploy designed to influence Americans to buy whatever product big businesses want us to buy next. Having said that, I see no reason to switch from my old Fusion to newer and more expensive cartridges. It received three stars due to the promises made by Gillette, and the fact there older products are just as functional as this newer, more expensive one.    "

At first I thought it was crazy to spend about $120.00 on a toothbrush, but I\'m glad I did. I was probably like alot of you who used the regular toothbrushes that only cost about $3.00 or so.  About a month ago my dentist asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  Told him just a plain jane toothbrush which I switch out every 3 months or so.  He recommended that I purchase an electric one because he\'s a firm believer in them.  He told me what kind he had, which was the Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable made by Oral-B.  He said there are several different price ranges, styles, and brands.  One of the many features I like on mine is the wireless SmartGuide which has a personalizing timer on it.  This helps you brush all four quadrants of your mouth equally. 5 brushing modes- Daily Clean, Sensative, Massage, Whitening, and Deep Clean.  It also has an idicator that lights up when too much pressure is being applied, this is a great feature because I was brushing too hard with my regular toothbrush which caused my gums to bleed.  Since I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 I haven\'t had any problems with it, no bleeding gums, and my teeth feel as though I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  If there is a Con it would be that I had to purchase the precision clean head seperately because it only comes with the floss action and ProWhite heads.  However you also get a 5.00 off coupon to save money on your additional heads you might purchase.  Over all I\'m more than happy with the product and Amazon.com didn\'t waste anytime getting it sent to me.  I hope this helps any possible future buyers. Semper FI"

Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week\'s time, in my case of twice daily use. While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful! Not only is this toothbrush built for home use, it\'s the one you won\'t want to be without wherever you go.I especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I\'m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds. The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who\'ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have... yet I found I can get used to the sonic sensations, and I even feel that my gums and teeth are gaining strength, cleanliness and overall health. Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.So just how compact is this toothbrush? At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one\'s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing. The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth. The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.The directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I\'ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do). Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question. This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush I don\'t want to live without!  Highly, highly recommended."

Finding a great toothbrush can be a chore with the seemingly infinite options. When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions. Let me say I will be sticking with this one. The bristles are firm and \'aggressive\', albeit a gentle aggressive if that makes sense, while soft making it less likely to brush away enamel and/or gums. This was key for me. Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line. The back of the head of the brush serves as a tongue cleaner. It is really a scraper, so it\'s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn\'t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it. I highly recommend this brush!"

I imagine this is what Apple goes through when they release a new iPhone - nothing will match the excitement of the very first model.I am not convinced that the \'thinner blades\' are actually better - seems like this may just be another marketing ploy to get away with cheaper materials.With all that said, I tried using the proglide a few more times and thought that it worked consistently well every time - and I was actually able to get a very close shave with a single path \'against the grain\', and without any skin irritation at all.

I, also like the single blade that allows me to sculpt my goatee. The blades do give me a close shave. So if it tugs the hair, you should probably use a  better shaving cream.Now the things I wish were better about the razor:The blades have a lubricating strip on them that works wonderfully at first and,  after one or two shaves, the strip turns white and loses its lubrication. For the price, its not like you\'re going to throw it away after one shave. The other factor is that the price of the replacement blades borders on rediculous. This is supposed to be inexpensive hygiene tool like a toothbrush or under arm deodorant. These blades cost more than both of them combined. Doesn\'t make sense to buy the blades when it is just as expensive to let my barber do it for me. The razor itself is decently priced. I would love this product if blades were cheaper.    "

That\'s the way I felt after using this toothbrush.I\'ve tried plenty of motorized toothbrushes in the past, from expensive to the cheapies you can grab for six bucks at a supermarket, but I\'ve always returned to a standard manual brush. Not this time, though.The Vitality is really incredible. The included two-brush heads (and you get two of them) have an oscillating section at the top, and a section that goes back and forth beneath it. While one polishes and cleans one tooth, the other is getting between them, almost making floss redundant (I said almost). It even has a timer that goes off after two minutes, pulsating the motor a couple of times to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing.After charging it up for 16 hours (which they say will give you a week of twice-a-day brushing sessions), I followed the manufacturer\'s suggestions for how to use it (yes, I actually read them - all part of the review), and can honestly say no other home toothbrush has ever made my teeth feel so clean.Additional brush heads are available in various styles, though why I\'d ever want anything beyond the two brush style that came with it eludes me (they do make a polishing head though, which I suppose I can understand even if I\'m not personally interested). According to the instructions, each head should last about three months, and with refils costing about four bucks per head (in a package of six), that nets out to about 12 dollars a year for refils: a steal for how well this works.I\'m already buying another for my kids\' bathroom: because it comes with two heads they can each have one (downside: no color coding, so I\'ll use a sharpie to delineate them).A fantastic toothbrush that is at last worth ditching a standard manual brush for, I can recommend this without reservation."

I go between the two as far as replacement blades and whichever is on sale. They are pretty similar, and either of the blades actually fit on either the razors.I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago. I have since tried a few new models thinking that perhaps one of these new razors might work better... but I keep coming back to this razor.The Mach 3 is so far, the only replaceable blade razor that I have found I can easily, properly shave my head without nicks and cuts. The blades tend to wear fairly quickly compared with the Shick Hydro 5, but what is the use of longer lasting blades that slice my head to ribbons?The grip is a great improvement on the Sensor XL, more heft, better wet grip. The blades are easy to attach and remove. They last me a couple of weeks on average, but I shave my head every two to three days and shave my neck below my beard every day. That\'s a lot of use.I did start using a new shave gel and it works magically with the razor. No more issues with serious gumming up of the blades. Check out King of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.. It\'s expensive for a shave gel, but nothing works better for shaving my head and preventing the shave gel/cream from gumming the blades.I know the replacement blades are expensive, and many third party sellers are reselling stolen merchandise... but that\'s part of why they are expensive. Those of us who are buying the blades on the up and up are paying for all those stolen and re-sold packages. So I just recommend buying from a store or trusted seller rather than eBay. Also watch for replacement blades not sold in retail packaging. Often these are either knock offs or have \'fallen off a truck\'. Spend the extra $5 and make sure you are getting the quality blades from a reliable source.    "

It felt like I was trying to brush my teeth with my thumb.  I had trouble getting the brush into the far reaches of my mouth whereas before with the smaller head I had no problems.  I\'m not a small person either, I\'m 6\'1\' and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  It\'s really not that different than the standard head, it\'s just bigger.  I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  Because of this, getting the brush into every nook and cranny is now more difficult.  Also, because it is bigger, it\'s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.  I should have bought the single one just to try it out, but I was certain I\'d love the bigger one.  Oh well..."

Personally, I like to keep it simple -- any more than two blades and it\'s hard to clean out the stubble, but that makes for a rougher shave.  My wife has been using this one and enjoys it enough that she plans to stick with this brand when the five razors that come with this set have been used.  She says it is a comfortable shave and keeps her skin smooth.  Apart from the appeal of the razors, she also likes the handy shower wall holder.  I like that too, since it keeps her razors out of the tub -- and I can\'t say I mind the smooth skin on her legs.    "

I loved that it came with a replacement head and that it had a storage rack with suction cups, so it could be placed out of the reach of children.  The razor itself had a great \'soft\' grip and a nice wide moisture strip.  But...... the Cons --The wide \'face\' on this razor kept it from delivering a close shave even though there were 5 blades.  When I used it on my legs I found that it didn\'t get REALLY close, although it was very maneuverable.  When my husband tried it, he found the same thing, plus the wide head meant that it really couldn\'t be easily used as a man\'s razor because there were places it just wouldn\'t go-- like under the nose.Still... the Pros --Where this razor absolutely excelled was the \'nick\' test.  I found that no matter how fast I shaved my legs I never came close to cutting myself, even around the knee.  In fact, I am so impressed with this razor that I called my sister to recommend that she get it for my nieces who are just getting to the age where they will soon be shaving.I think this is an ideal razor for shaving newbies.Pam T~    "

I had been using the Mach 3 and Gillette 3 blade disposible (along with Edge Ultra-sensitive gel), but noticed more and more razor bumps. It got so bad, that I had to take the day off from work because I couldn\'t show my totally raw/cut/irritated face.  Needless to say, my skin is sensitive.Well, I didn\'t shave for 2 days trying to baby my skin so it would recover.  The next day, I had to shave so I had to make a decisionAs with most cases, when I need something answered, or need other people\'s opinions, I fired up the good ol\' web browser.  I started by researching electric razors since I heard they were easier on your face, but after reading the reviews, I couldn\'t see spending $150 for something that may not even help and probably wouldn\'t give me as close a shave.I had heard of the Fusion and it did sound interesting to me.  The 5 blade feature didn\'t impress me as much as the fact that the blades are closer together.  I figured if they\'re closer it wouldn\'t give my skin the chance to get between them and be sliced off - excuse my graphic language :) I looked up reviews on the Fusion and found some mention of it being good for sensitive skin.  That did it for me, so off I went to buy a Fusion.When I got to the store, their were rows and rows of empty racks (I would guess at least 20 rows) where all the Fusions had been.  Seems like they\'re very popular with the local crowd.  Anyhow there was ONE left and I nabbed it.Got it home and immediately went in to shave.What a difference!  No razor new razor bumps, and it didn\'t even irritate the old ones (from my Gillette disposables).  No cuts, no irritation whatsoever!  And it really gives you a smooth shave.  Even my wife was impressed with my smooth face!So, moral to this story.  If you have sensitive skin, and you want a really close shave with no irritation, get the Fusion.  And yes I agree, the cartridges are pretty expensive, but to me my face is worth it.    "
