33,33,20100902,B001F51V3E,4,"September 2, 2010",AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,Light Conditioning and Neutral pH,"I like Pantene shampoo.  One of the reasons is that it\'s strong enough to really clean your hair but not so harsh that it dries your scalp.  In the past I\'ve had highlights and I\'ve used this shampoo without any detrimental effects.  Granted, if I colored my hair again I would use a shampoo made especially for treated hair (probably Pantene, since I\'m a creature of habit).As far as conditioning I have to say that it is very light.  For my daughter, for example, who has fine, straight, but remarkably easy-to-tangle hair, we still have to use a detangler.  So it\'s a lighter conditioning effect than if you used a separate conditioner.  Personally I like this because it doesn\'t \'weigh\' down my hair, just controls the humidity frizzes.OVERALL, a gentle, thorough cleanser with gentle conditioning that makes combing after shampooing easier.Pam T~mom-blogger",

They\'re brighter, more dimensional, and really do appear to sparkle. Also, my hair has felt super soft since I started using this shampoo.I do notice that my hair looks a lot better if I use Pantene every day. I generally like to switch up the shampoo I use on a daily basis, but my highlights tend to look best when I use this day after day.I guess you may not be eager to purchase a 3-pack if you haven\'t tried this shampoo yet, but you\'ll most likely want to before long!

Only, I am told that it is important to switch shampoos and conditioners occasionally, and I may listen to this advice, because, recently the Smooth Vitality conditioner hasn\'t been working so well on my hair. I must say, I like it better than many other Pantene products, especially the new line- Thin, Medium/Thick different solutions.

I bought this spray with my daughter in mind. Her hair is often unruly and is pretty curly. I wanted something that I could put in right after her baths so that she didn\'t have a frizzy halo effect. I tried it on her immediately and can\'t say I noticed much difference. The odor is pleasant and the fine mist spray was adequate. It rinsed easily off of my hands, which is a major plus.The real test was my hair. I sprayed it down and just twisted it into several quick twists that I secured with bobby pins. I forgot about it for 2 hours and then removed the pins. Wow. My hair was so curly, more than I\'ve ever achieved even with a curling iron. The gel spray really held them without my hair feeling too crunchy or full of product. I  quickly gave myself a Medusa-style \'do with the curls going straight up off my scalp. I fluffed and frizzed it up. The volume of it was almost scary. Then I thought I\'d really test the gel spray. A few spritzes on my giant bunch of curls and immediately they unfrizzed and were easier to tame without losing all the volume.Ilove how versatile my hair suddenly feels. This gel was really fun to use when I felt the whim to change things up. I think it\'s inspired me to keep trying out something difference, since my hair has been straight and flat year after year. For the price, its definitely worth a try.",

I don\'t like using serums because they involve combing my hair with my fingers to saturate each strand, leaving it stringy and flat once it dries. Detangling sprays are the way to go. I\'ve used a lot of different brands in the past, and really you can\'t go wrong with many of them. But this one is special because it\'s specifically for my hair type. My hair has never looked so curly before. I wash my hair, spray the detangler lightly (too heavy and your hair will look greasy within a few hours), distribute it with my fingers, and leave it to dry. It turns out perfect every time. Without it my hair is just a frizzy mess.The second ingredient is a silicone called amodimethicone. I\'ve heard some bad things about silicones, but I think people are just paranoid about cheap hair ingredients. I don\'t notice any excessive drying or build-up in my hair, so I\'m not worried about it.The smell is awesome, too. It lingers for a long time and has a fresh, clean scent.I really hope Pantene sticks with this one.",

Initially frizzy & poofy the day I wash, but frizz mostly dies after i sleep on it.I usually alternate between wearing my hair curly, flat ironing it, or just doing nothing to it and tying it back in a bun.  But the past few months I had given up on wearing my hair curly because I was tired of all the bad products out there. They either did nothing to combat my frizzies, left my curls looking thin and \'scrunchy\', or left my hair just totally flat, which is quite the accomplishment because I have very long, thick hair with a lot of natural volume.My prayers are answered with the Pantene Pro-V Curly line!! I usually always try & use organic products on my hair (without sulfites and stuff) so I was hesitant to try this. But I\'m so glad I did. I bought the shampoo, the conditioner, the mousse & the hairspray. Together they are awesome! After my shower i wrapped my hair in a towel on top of my head, after about 10 minutes i undid the towel, then gently (i try not to toussle my hair around too much when its wet because i feel as if this makes it more frizzy) ran a moderate amount of mouse throughout my curls, separating them and making sure i coat all my hair.I let my hair air dry and occasionally twisted a few curls here and there with my finger and added a teenny tiny bit more mousse here and there where i thought it was starting to frizz up. My curls look extra curly, lots of volume, not crunchy at all & it helped with the frizz A LOT too. I used the hairspray VERY sparingly, i feel as if this is the only product in the line that may cause any sort of \'crunchiness\', so be careful with that one. Just don\'t use too much.I will use this line whenever i want to wear my hair curly (which will now be more often) but I will stick with my organic shampoos for all other times.Also, ***side note***, I was due for a trim when i tried this product so the ends of my hair were very frayed, and anyone with curly hair knows that just makes your hair look even MORE frizzy. So i used a dollop of \'nexxus pro mend  leave in treatment creme\' on my ends and...AMAZING! I know it doesn\'t really \'mend\' my split ends, but it does temporarily bind them together making them practically invisible (until i wash my hair again) and cuts down on almost all the frizz, so my ends look awesome. So i suggest adding that to your curly hair routine if you have split ends",

I would recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner at least three days in a row in order to get the best results. It smells great, and works awesome!

I often suffer from frizziness or a lack of definition in my curls.This Pantene conditioner was average at best -- it smells nice, goes on easily, but leaves my hair feeling very coated -- in a slippery way, however, which is often nice with difficult to manage curly hair.  The matching shampoo was a terrible disappointment however (leaving my hair feeling unclean and coated in a non-slippery way) -- so I tried this conditioner with several other shampoos (both Pantene and non-Pantene sorts).  The best results came after  something like Pantene\'s old Ice Shine shampoo -- though still, only average smoothing and mild taming of my locks, which definitely felt over-coated even after a thorough rinsing.I second what an earlier reviewer said about silicone -- it\'s a shortcut for curly hair that seems to pay you back later in buildup and less-than-satisfactory results in the long run, and it\'s disappointing to find it in this product.I wouldn\'t go out of my way to recommend this conditioner, though I\'ll keep it on hand to use when I\'m out of everything else!",

Her hair is less tangled and seems to be stronger and less dry, no small feat with our water, which seems to be extremely chlorinated and dries everyone\'s hair out a good bit. It of course smells great and seems softer to the touch as well. She\'s used much more expensive hair care products before, and these seem to be as good as any of those have been, if not better. While I don\'t think the effects are quite as dramatic as we were hoping for, I see that as a problem with our water rather than blaming it on this conditioner.

I found a Fekkai product not too long ago tht finally relaxed things enough to where my hair started to look normal and shiny again. But Fekkai products are spendy and I was still hoping to find something more budget friendly. This fits the bill. It is about 1/3 the price of the Fekkai product and it a comparable job. I used about a dime sized amount for shoulder length hair.I let my hair air dry, and my waves actually curled up quite nicely.

In fact, I have to say that the Pro-v Curly Hair Conditioner is one of the better after shampoo products I\'ve used. At around five bucks a pop, it isn\'t a bargain brand, but is less then many of the middle to high-end conditioners. I confess that I don\'t often use a conditioner unless it is a 2-in-1 version combined with a shampoo, but I do use my wife\'s from time to time. This Pantene Pro-v has all but the top-tier stuff beat.Granted, I don\'t have curly locks so I can\'t comment on how it works for the intended hair type, but for my short to medium straight hair, it\'s just dandy. My hair varies from one to six inches in length and after using the Pro-v conditioner; it was noticeably soft and manageable. No frizz to speak of. My wife\'s longer tresses like it too. She has wavy hair and her use of it produced similar results -- very soft, lots of body, no frizz. She was pleased. We\'d both recommend it for any hair type.If I had to change one thing, it would be to tone down the scent.

The biggest problem with long curly hair, besides women telling me it isn\'t fair for a guy to have curls when they don\'t (only heard this about two million times over the last four decades), is that it can be an ordeal to get a comb through after a few days without washing, such as backcountry hiking, etc.Enter Pantene conditioners. I just started using them a few months ago, so this one for curly hair is right up my alley. I am normally one of those weirdos who uses as much organic stuff as possible, both food and other stuff such as shampoos, toothpaste, etc. I just don\'t like putting manmade chemicals on my body or in the environment. But this stuff is so efficient that I need only a tiny bit to do all my hair, less than half compared to the Nature\'s Gate Organics I normally use. Plus, it detangles the biggest mess of knots in seconds! I swear, it takes me ten minutes of careful slow work to get a comb through with almost every other conditioner when me locks is all dreaded up, but this stuff somehow detangles them in no time flat.It\'s almost a miracle! For that kind of performance and efficiency, I\'ll deal with a few chemical components, especially as it takes so little of this stuff to do the trick. I still use my organic stuff more than half the time, but switching it up with this Pantene is working great for those times when I\'m in a hurry, or my hair is so knotty that I\'ll pull out big clumps while trying to detangle it.In short: if you have long, curly hair that often tangles, I haven\'t found a better conditioner that will detangle hair quicker, and with less product needed, than this stuff. Plus, it\'s really pretty cheap at 5 clams for a big bottle, which will last you dozens of uses. Very fairly priced indeed.Zero complaints from me about this stuff.Highly recommended."

The product claims to \'moisturize, control frizz and define curls,\' and while the results aren\'t miraculous, one can expect the hair to feel and look smoother, moisturized, and less frizzy after conditioning with this product (compared with no conditioner). It seems to be my experience that, if I blow-dry my hair completely after conditioning with this product, the hair looks somewhat smooth, but full and light at the same time (not weighed down). However, if you\'d like some \'defined curls,\' you might want to air-dry your hair a little rather than blow-drying it completely.

My hair doesn\'t look or feel dry after use, but still I thought I should add the companion conditioner just to be safe.  So far am pleased with it too.  Most conditioners make my hair hopelessly flat, but this product works well with the shampoo and doesn\'t counteract the shampoo\'s benefits.After using this shampoo, my scalp, which tends to be itchy, also feels good.  Since I use a lot of hair spray, I wonder if it is more effective at removing that residue from my scalp than other shampoos.
