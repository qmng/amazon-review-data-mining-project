I scrunch my hair every day and i made the mistake of using just gel and my hair looked good at first but it was dry and frizzy it looked a mess by the end of the day. So before i went to Church last night i tried to scrunch it again only this time i used this on my hair before i put the gel in my hair and scrunched it and it made it so tamed and smooth and pretty. It smells amazing i\'m buying more before i run out because it makes my hair look nice so i don\'t have to worry about it. Pantene please don\'t take this off the market and if it helps i usually have really frizzy hair and this helped.Hope this reviews helped anyone who reads it.God bless :D,

I know that is so not-cool in the hair realm,) and this gives my hair a freshly-cut look. I\'ve always known to get a hair cut when it gets tangled incredibly easily and there is no way of keeping it looking decent for an hour after it has been washed. It does absolute wonders. I put three squirts in (like I said, LONG hair) and then let it air dry. Granted it does take a bit longer to dry with the product in, my hair looks healthier and shinier than ever. I don\'t have to do anything to it. I can run my fingers through it and it feels as if I don\'t have any product in my hair. HIGHLY recommended. I have naturally straight hair, and I don\'t have to touch it with any heating object to get a nice flat-ironed look. Wonderful stuff right here.",

Pantene Pro-V Restore gave life back to my hair. It is shiny and silky and even my hairdresser noticed that my \' hair is healthier\'. I only have to use a small amount after each shampoo. My hair is easy to style and I use the flat iron to smooth over certain areas after I shampoo and blow dry. It has cut out the need for me to be constantly restyling my hair.

I was disappointed when it arrived and it was Curls to Straight.  I hadn\'t realized I wanted Dry to Moisturized Conditioner, they are both part of the Curly Hair series.I was so frustrated with the packaging and label which I thought was misleading, I called Pantene.  I told them about my confusion (and that I obviously didn\'t read the entire name) and they actually sent me coupons to buy the correct product.I have curly hair & I want to have curly hair but I was out of conditioner so I used the Curls to Straight.  I thought my hair was untangled and smooth just like I like it.  I did not find that it straightened my curls.  Maybe they expect you to use it with other products and try to straighten your hair (like blow dry it straight)?  I used it for a couple of weeks before the coupons arrived and I replaced it with the other product.  By the end of the 2 weeks my hair did seem more relaxed but I\'m not sure if part of that is the winter dry weather (my hair is much curlier in the humid weather).I appreciate the customer service of the company especially since it was my mistake.",

Thoroughly brush your hair, and use conservatively. I\'ve used this on my hair, following the suggestions, with no problems. In the past, when I haven\'t, I\'ve had the same problems mentioned in previous reviews. It\'s a LIGHT detangler, not a miracle product if your hair is typically a tangled mess in the morning. I still use this on my daughter\'s morning tangle-prone hair with good results.

99,101,20111230,B003EGYDI2,4,"December 30, 2011",A2766O42C097O0,Fun hair product!,"First, I should admit that I do not have naturally curly hair. I\'m 1/2 Asian, so my hair is mostly straight. I bought this spray with my daughter in mind. Her hair is often unruly and is pretty curly. I wanted something that I could put in right after her baths so that she didn\'t have a frizzy halo effect. I tried it on her immediately and can\'t say I noticed much difference. The odor is pleasant and the fine mist spray was adequate. It rinsed easily off of my hands, which is a major plus.The real test was my hair. I sprayed it down and just twisted it into several quick twists that I secured with bobby pins. I forgot about it for 2 hours and then removed the pins. Wow. My hair was so curly, more than I\'ve ever achieved even with a curling iron. The gel spray really held them without my hair feeling too crunchy or full of product. I  quickly gave myself a Medusa-style \'do with the curls going straight up off my scalp. I fluffed and frizzed it up. The volume of it was almost scary. Then I thought I\'d really test the gel spray. A few spritzes on my giant bunch of curls and immediately they unfrizzed and were easier to tame without losing all the volume.Ilove how versatile my hair suddenly feels. This gel was really fun to use when I felt the whim to change things up. I think it\'s inspired me to keep trying out something difference, since my hair has been straight and flat year after year. For the price, its definitely worth a try.",

But I figured, \'What the heck, conditioner is conditioner\'. I realize that isn\'t entirely true, but I certainly didn\'t think it could hurt.What I right? Yes! In fact, I have to say that the Pro-v Curly Hair Conditioner is one of the better after shampoo products I\'ve used. At around five bucks a pop, it isn\'t a bargain brand, but is less then many of the middle to high-end conditioners. I confess that I don\'t often use a conditioner unless it is a 2-in-1 version combined with a shampoo, but I do use my wife\'s from time to time. This Pantene Pro-v has all but the top-tier stuff beat.Granted, I don\'t have curly locks so I can\'t comment on how it works for the intended hair type, but for my short to medium straight hair, it\'s just dandy. My hair varies from one to six inches in length and after using the Pro-v conditioner; it was noticeably soft and manageable. No frizz to speak of. My wife\'s longer tresses like it too. She has wavy hair and her use of it produced similar results -- very soft, lots of body, no frizz. She was pleased. We\'d both recommend it for any hair type.If I had to change one thing, it would be to tone down the scent.

The biggest problem with long curly hair, besides women telling me it isn\'t fair for a guy to have curls when they don\'t (only heard this about two million times over the last four decades), is that it can be an ordeal to get a comb through after a few days without washing, such as backcountry hiking, etc.Enter Pantene conditioners. I just started using them a few months ago, so this one for curly hair is right up my alley. I am normally one of those weirdos who uses as much organic stuff as possible, both food and other stuff such as shampoos, toothpaste, etc. I just don\'t like putting manmade chemicals on my body or in the environment. But this stuff is so efficient that I need only a tiny bit to do all my hair, less than half compared to the Nature\'s Gate Organics I normally use. Plus, it detangles the biggest mess of knots in seconds! I swear, it takes me ten minutes of careful slow work to get a comb through with almost every other conditioner when me locks is all dreaded up, but this stuff somehow detangles them in no time flat.It\'s almost a miracle! For that kind of performance and efficiency, I\'ll deal with a few chemical components, especially as it takes so little of this stuff to do the trick. I still use my organic stuff more than half the time, but switching it up with this Pantene is working great for those times when I\'m in a hurry, or my hair is so knotty that I\'ll pull out big clumps while trying to detangle it.In short: if you have long, curly hair that often tangles, I haven\'t found a better conditioner that will detangle hair quicker, and with less product needed, than this stuff. Plus, it\'s really pretty cheap at 5 clams for a big bottle, which will last you dozens of uses. Very fairly priced indeed.Zero complaints from me about this stuff.Highly recommended."
227,231,20100613,B003JA3KDW,3,"June 13, 2010",A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,"OK conditioner, weird curling results","My hair has a natural wave that is easily coaxed into curls with a little gel or mousse and allowing to air dry.  The Pantene curly hair series conditioner doesn\'t condition my dry ends as much as other conditioners do, but at the same time it didn\'t make it worse as some products have, so I can\'t really complain.The conditioner is quite clingy in the shower, meaning it\'s really hard to massage into the entire length of my hair.  It wants to say where it was first applied, which is quite odd.  It rinses clean and smells nice.  I don\'t use more of it than I do any of Pantene\'s conditioners.When I use the conditioner and just let my hair air dry without product, my hair becomes what I suppose could be called \'curlier.\'  In fact, it\'s as though my hair gets separated out into a series of almost ringlet-like strands.  However, it\'s frizzy, and when I comb through my hair it loses those ringlet things and just becomes a fuzzy bunch of waves.  It is easily tamed by some (other brand) of mild leave-in conditioner and/or spray curl enhancer.  In comparison, I have some Pantene conditioner for dyed hair from their previous series and, while it doesn\'t leave my hair in those ringlet-curls, it also doesn\'t leave my hair frizzy either.When I use the curly hair series conditioner with product in my hair and let it air dry, the hair avoids the ringlet look and turns into what\'s more of an 80s perm, but not frizzy at all.  Combing it out produces a pretty nice series of controlled waves, but there is a tendency to frizz during the day.  Again comparing it with the Pantene conditioner for color-treated hair, it works about the same but provides more controlled waves than the color-treated version does.In all, I personally wouldn\'t buy the curl series conditioner.  Actually, I\'m not sure if I\'d buy any of their product as their current line exists.  See, I\'ve used many Pantene products over the years, and years ago I used Pantene curl products and liked them.  The conditioner was much better than this version; however, Pantene reformulates and repackages their products every few years, which not only means you lose the type of Pantene you liked to use, but also that it\'s hard to stick with Pantene as an overall brand.  I did (and do) continue to use Pantene, always buying whatever series had stronger conditioning than their ever-present Classic Care line.However, with this new series there is no high-conditioning product.  Right now they have Classic Care as they always do, plus curly, color treated, fine hair, medium-thick hair... well, my hair is 3 out of those 4, which do I choose?  I suspect everyone\'s hair falls into more than one of Pantene\'s categories.  It\'s possible there isn\'t a product in their current line-up for me to use, which means I\'ll have to wait 2-3 years until they reformulate yet again.",

My \'curls\' were relaxed so much that they were for the most part non-existant.  Pantene warns you should only buy this product if you have curly hair, so it was really my bad for miscategorizing my hair as curly.

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos",

There is nothing truly special about it. The scent is very \'right off the shelf of the drug-store\'. It smells like every other bottle of pantene to me, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing. It is what it is!The conditioner doesn\'t seem to phase my completely unruly, pin straight, fine yet dense hair. I have the strangest hair. Some days it feels very thick and voluminous and others it feels very flat and light. I want a conditioner that adds a nice density to my fine strands but doesn\'t cause my scalp to get oily after a few hours. This doesn\'t do the trick for me.I am also turned off by the fact that this is NOT sls free. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the cheapest method for a company to get it\'s product lathering or textured a certain way and it is literaly the same stuff they use in car wash soaps and degreasing chemicals for car engines. In the same way as it dissolves the grease on the car engines, sodium lauryl sulfate also dissolves the oils on your skin, which can cause a drying effect, which in turn might cause an overproduction of oils, as is my case. It is also well documented that it denatures skin proteins, which causes not only irritation, but also allows environmental contaminants easier access to the lower, sensitive layers of the skin.Products with SLS are not only dangerous for the skin but they can also effect a person\'s hormones and lead to various forms of cancer. So, in the long run, it is better to invest the five bucks you would pay for a tube of this stuff and get something that is CLEARLY marked SLS-FREE. That said, for those less conscious or interested in the harm that SLS can cause...this conditioner will probably be a staple in your shower. It smells fresh and does it\'s job OK for that everyday-pantene price.It\'s not something I would ever buy or endorse though.",

When your hair is that clean, it\'s very important to use a good conditioner to replace lost moisture. Fine hair needs a very special type of conditioner that will not weigh hair down and flatten it, and the best conditioner I have ever found is one that rinses out minutes after it is put on after shampooing.This is a lovely light scented shampoo that cleans extremely well and leaves your fine hair feeling light, full and bouncy.

I used to be plagued with split ends and now they are a thing of the past. I like this volumizing product because it enables me to do braids, thick ponytails and upswept styles with various accessories. My hair is also totally straight, so this product and other Pantene products have eliminated the need for a body perm. I will probably buy the product again. The only thing that has always bothered me is that Procter and Gamble insists on animal testing and I have six recued pet rats (often they are lab rats). I really wish they would stop this as their products are good and Pantene products are some of the best on the market.",

When I received the package, I noticed that it did not look anything like the real thing! It has the name in English, French, and I believe in Spanish. In the REAL product at the store, it only has it in English. It also has a different smell. Overall, I would still continue to order this product because it works, my hair is usually very frizzy and after I started using this it has made it less frizzy, and a lot more softer. Only thing that bugs me is that they would sell it as the real thing but in reality it isn\'t.",

I have screen prints too saying pack of 3.. when I contacted amazon, they said I will receive only 1.. and when I asked I want to return, I was asked to pay 3.99 in s/h .. this is ridiculous amazon! we expect better from you.",

Amazon bait-and-switched us on this one. I\'ve had the same issue on multi-packs one razors and batteries... I have no idea why I keep doing this to myself :P,

I am very happy with the results, this product really works, it smells great, & leaves my hair straight & soft without the \'clumping or stiffining\' that I would get from other products.  Now that I have this, I will not go back to the others!",

My hair is really thick and pretty dry, but after using this it\'s a lot softer and prettier.  It also helped bring back my waves that bleaching has taken away.  I used to spend an hour straightening my hair to look presentable, but with this I can just let it air dry and it looks good!",
