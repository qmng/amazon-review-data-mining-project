They\'re brighter, more dimensional, and really do appear to sparkle. Also, my hair has felt super soft since I started using this shampoo.I do notice that my hair looks a lot better if I use Pantene every day. I generally like to switch up the shampoo I use on a daily basis, but my highlights tend to look best when I use this day after day.I guess you may not be eager to purchase a 3-pack if you haven\'t tried this shampoo yet, but you\'ll most likely want to before long!

This works the best for me of all the conditioners I have ever tried. Pantene changed the name a couple of years ago from Always Smooth to Medium-Thick but it\'s the same stuff and I hope they never try to tweak the recipe because I think it\'s perfectly formulated.

Whenever it\'s down, everyone compliments my hair. It feels so much lighter and the smell stays in longer. My hair has never been this healthy before.For my long hair, I can go through this product pretty quickly, so I limit myself by masagging already dampened strands into dry ones. Apply once a week, s I apply on my day off on Tuesdays, wait until I\'m through with all my house work and work outs, take a shower then apply this and leave it in for a few hours with my hair up.

And I am not a woman of color, unless you call bleaching and coloring your hair blonde to pink to purple back to blonde or blue all year long.I really thought this product would help relax and condition my hair and somehow help it overcome the harshness from all the chemicals I used on it last year. I admit I was making progress with some herbal essence conditioner in the blue bottle that I used as a leave in and was honestly seeing improvemnts so far. I has shine & more length, less tangles, softness and hardly no frizzies.And then I saw this and assumed this was what I needed to get quicker instant results.WRONG! I wish I had never used this.

I used it the next day and was amazed.  It took the frizz out of my hair and made my hair feel so soft and nice.  It\'s my expectations that with further applications it will only improve my hair.  One thing, however, is that if your hair is really damaged and/or dry/frizzy, then leave it on for 30 min to 1 hour using a shower cap or plastic bag for really deep treatment.  It rivals any other moisturizing treatment that costs up to $50.  A great product at a fantastic price!  Try it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If a product is strong enough to hold ringlets in place, it usually leaves your hair \'crunchy\' when it dries. If a product dries and is soft and touchable, it usually doesn\'t hold well. Pantene Mousse for curly hair gives ringlets definition yet doesn\'t dry crunchy.  Apply to wet hair, comb to distribute, shape curls and let dry without touching. PLUS, when it\'s dry you can reactivate it with a spray of water and reshape your style. Most other products don\'t do that, and it\'s a definite bonus.

Her hair varies from wavy to loosely curly, depending on how long it is and how it\'s been washed and dried. The long parts tangle very easily, and the short parts curl and spring every which way, so I was hoping this conditioner would help eliminate the tangling while defining and controlling her curls a bit better.This conditioner did do a great job of detangling and smoothing my daughter\'s hair. I was able to comb it easily wet right out of the bath, and, better yet, the tangles stayed away and it remained easy to brush even after she\'d slept on it. The short, springy bits of her hair, however, haven\'t been any better under control with this conditioner. If anything, they seem harder to style into submission.

I have used Matrix Biolage (LOVE the smell, hate the price,) Jason all natural products, Nature\'s Gate all natural products, and a variety of other professional and drug store quality products. Many of these products are good, some don\'t really do much of anything once they\'re rinsed from my hair. Pantene has always worked well for me, and my hair feels drenched in moisture after using this. It never feels greasy, only healthy, and detangled.

The biggest problem with long curly hair, besides women telling me it isn\'t fair for a guy to have curls when they don\'t (only heard this about two million times over the last four decades), is that it can be an ordeal to get a comb through after a few days without washing, such as backcountry hiking, etc.Enter Pantene conditioners. I just started using them a few months ago, so this one for curly hair is right up my alley. I am normally one of those weirdos who uses as much organic stuff as possible, both food and other stuff such as shampoos, toothpaste, etc. I just don\'t like putting manmade chemicals on my body or in the environment. But this stuff is so efficient that I need only a tiny bit to do all my hair, less than half compared to the Nature\'s Gate Organics I normally use. Plus, it detangles the biggest mess of knots in seconds! I swear, it takes me ten minutes of careful slow work to get a comb through with almost every other conditioner when me locks is all dreaded up, but this stuff somehow detangles them in no time flat.It\'s almost a miracle! For that kind of performance and efficiency, I\'ll deal with a few chemical components, especially as it takes so little of this stuff to do the trick. I still use my organic stuff more than half the time, but switching it up with this Pantene is working great for those times when I\'m in a hurry, or my hair is so knotty that I\'ll pull out big clumps while trying to detangle it.In short: if you have long, curly hair that often tangles, I haven\'t found a better conditioner that will detangle hair quicker, and with less product needed, than this stuff. Plus, it\'s really pretty cheap at 5 clams for a big bottle, which will last you dozens of uses. Very fairly priced indeed.Zero complaints from me about this stuff.Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My \'curls\' were relaxed so much that they were for the most part non-existant.  Pantene warns you should only buy this product if you have curly hair, so it was really my bad for miscategorizing my hair as curly.

I normally put on the conditioner, then a shower cap and leave it on for a good 20 minutes, but with this product I leave it on for 5 minutes (no shower cap) and bam, that\'s it!

235,239,20100606,B003JA3KDW,4,"June 6, 2010",A3S96B2GBP04N2,Too much perfume but satisfied with it\'s performance,"Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works as advertised. It\'s a nice thick conditioner which controls the frizz and helps to detangle your hair in the shower.My hair type is thick and coarse and naturally wavy and tends to frizz. I usually use a leave in glossing cream after I wash my hair to detangle my hair without breakage and to keep my hair from becoming a frizzy mess.I live in Texas and right now the summer is coming on and it\'s hot and humid so it\'s the perfect recipe for my hair to frizz.The first time I used this conditioner was after swimming and there was no way I could run a comb through my hair without help.  After shampooing with my normal shampoo I was able to detangle my hair using the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner in the shower with no breakage. The conditioner is thick so it coats my hair well while in the shower but it doesn\'t feel as if the conditioner rinses completely out of the hair.However after stepping out of the shower and toweling off the conditioning results weren\'t there and I still felt as I needed something to help comb my wet hair.I believe the reason for this is, is because of one of the ingredients used in this conditioner called \'Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\'.  Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone is a silicone which is used to coat the hair and is not water soluable so it creates the \'conditioning\' feel you feel when in the shower while the water is pouring over your head but once you step out of the shower it doesn\'t feel the same because it leaves a film behind which doesn\'t allow the hair to slide easily between each other.On the other hand the \'film\' Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone leaves behind is suppose to help control frizz which so far it has done well for me.I have used other Pantene daily conditioners before in the past and unless it was a treatment conditioner such as Pantene\'s \'Deep Fortifying\' conditioners then Pantene\'s daily conditioners are usually rather thin and never worked very well .If you have used Pantene\'s treatment conditioners then you have a general idea of the consistency and results of the Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner.The one thing I really did not like is the smell of this conditioner.  The perfume is much stronger with this product than with Pantene\'s other products. It\'s not over whelming but noticeable stronger than another of Pantene\'s product I currently own.I am sensitive to scents so what I feel is too much isn\'t always the case for someone else.  If you are someone who doesn\'t like a lot of perfume you may want to give this product a whiff the next time you are at a grocery store before you purchase it here from Amazon.I do not know if I will continue using this product. This is my third wash using this conditioner and so far I am happy with the results but I\'m sensitive to products which contain sulfates and with anything that leaves a film behind a strong cleaner is definitely needed to help remove build up between uses. If I notice that my non-sulfate shampoos are sufficient in cleaning between conditioning with this  than I\'ll probably stick to using this otherwise I\'ll probably return to my normal routine.In conclusion I give it a 4 stars because I believe that Pantene\'s Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works well for those battling frizzy hair and after my hair dried it was extremely soft but I don\'t care for the perfume because I feel it\'s too strong.I like to give a Pro and Con breakdown for each of my reviews so here is the list for this one.Pros1.

In that respect, this Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair conditioner is a winner. It has a pleasant, sweet smell that could conceivably trick people into believing it is my natural aroma, rather than the all-too-typical artificial odor of pears and alcohol (which is likely to make people think I drank too much and got into the stash of pears).In terms of functionality, this conditioner did a great job taming my somewhat frizzy hair, although it was no match for the occasionally intense humidity of DC summers.

I do notice a slight increase in volume when I use both the products together - the shampoo AND conditioner.  The scent lasts about a day.  My hair is very long, and wavy, and I notice a definite increase in waves and smoothness when I use it.  It makes my hair feel just very....fresh.I do find, that about every 5th shampoo, that if I use a different brand, then return to the Pantene, that it works even better, but this Pantene is my mainstay.  The only conditioner I like a bit better is the older salon brand: TIGI Bedhead, but it\'s 4-5 times this cost.  I\'ve been using this Pantene since it came out, even before Vine offered it to me.  It\'s really minimized split ends and breakage as well - a problem with hair as long as mine is.  Highly recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B.

I do have fine hair, but I\'m satisfied with the conditioner I\'ve been using (Garnier Fructis Bodyboost Conditioner. I was curious as to whether this would work better, but I didn\'t notice any difference. It does back up its claims, though. It\'s weightless, leaving no residue. It\'s hard for me to tell whether it really gave me any volume because my hair is layered to mask the flatness, anyway. It worked at least as well as my usual conditioner. The only thing I didn\'t like was the smell. It\'s not bad, but I prefer something lighter than the salon brand scent in this product. The smell stuck to my hair more than that of my usual conditioner. I\'m going to stick with that one, but I\'ll use this one up first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I did notice a little bit of a difference after the first use, but after continued use of the shampoo (almost through the whole bottle) I hardly see any great changes. I use the hairspray, shampoo, conditioner, heat protectant spray, and volumizing gel. The volumizing gel does make a great difference versus shampoo and conditioner alone.

For every review that raves about it, there will be another that rants.Mine is somewhere in the middle. When i used this shampoo, I liked it fine. My hair felt clean and the scent was not too perfumey. On the other hand, I personally didn\'t feel like it performed any magic either.In my opinion, the real problem with this shampoo (or any other similar product), is it becomes difficult to test them with out purchasing a $5 bottle. If you like it great, if not, then what do you do with the rest?So in the end, my advice is to either see if you can buy a sample size or to call the company and see if they are willing to send you a sample. See if you like how it works with your hair, because i am confident you don\'t care how well it did or did not do with mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She seemed happy with it -- no complaints, no raving about her sudden boost in volume either.One of the selling points of this shampoo is a focus on removing oils in the hair, which weigh it down. It\'d probably pay off to make sure you\'re conditioning after using this shampoo, even if you have relatively oily hair (as I do). You\'d be surprised how quick \'volume\' can turn into \'frizz\' if you let your hair dry out. I\'m a guy and don\'t really pay much attention to my hair, but even I know that.Right now this shampoo is going for around thirty bucks for a pack of 6 bottles. Not a steal, but not a ripoff either.

My hair is very humidity sensitive, and is very unmanageable when not cared for properly.  Many conditioners I have tried in hot humid weather make my hair greasy in some areas and dry in others. This conditioner is nourishing on ends and doesn't cling to the scalp area or mid hair section. It rinses clear and doesn't leave a residue.<br /><br />Although this works well in humidity-I have not had great results in dry weather, especially cold dry weather, with this conditioner. The water content seems to be very high in the product-and my hair became very stiff when used in colder weather (even though my hair was completely dry), and seemed slightly frozen.<br /><br />Hair type: lightened (blonde), greasy roots, dry/frazzled ends, split ends, thick, thin shaft

	4	""March 7, 2012",AV6823XS14U41,Works Best in Humidity,"My hair is very humidity sensitive, and is very unmanageable when not cared for properly.  Many conditioners I have tried in hot humid weather make my hair greasy in some areas and dry in others. This conditioner is nourishing on ends and doesn\'t cling to the scalp area or mid hair section. It rinses clear and doesn\'t leave a residue.Although this works well in humidity-I have not had great results in dry weather, especially cold dry weather, with this conditioner. The water content seems to be very high in the product-and my hair became very stiff when used in colder weather (even though my hair was completely dry), and seemed slightly frozen.Hair type: lightened (blonde), greasy roots, dry/frazzled ends, split ends, thick, thin shaft",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My husband has silver hair, I have chemically highlighted hair with gray at temples. The shampoo and conditioner leaves hair very very soft and shiny.  Did not leave any purple residue in my highlights.  use once a week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
485,433,20120406,B0073B3F06,5,"April 6, 2012",AMZG1Q5UHBL8C,Oooo Shiny,"I had used this in the past, and was very unhappy when they stopped making it.  I tried two other \'silver\' and a clarifying shampoo in other brands, and threw them away.  My ash brown hair with silver strands throughout was looking greige.  I was looking for another silver shampoo to try when I found Pantene had brought this back.  I ordered right away.  After one use of the shampoo and conditioner, my silver hairs reflected more light, and stood out more, and the rest of my hair looked shinier as well.  I hope they never sto making this again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
