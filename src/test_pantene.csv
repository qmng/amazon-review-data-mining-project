I scrunch my hair every day and i made the mistake of using just gel and my hair looked good at first but it was dry and frizzy it looked a mess by the end of the day. So before i went to Church last night i tried to scrunch it again only this time i used this on my hair before i put the gel in my hair and scrunched it and it made it so tamed and smooth and pretty. It smells amazing i\'m buying more before i run out because it makes my hair look nice so i don\'t have to worry about it. Pantene please don\'t take this off the market and if it helps i usually have really frizzy hair and this helped.Hope this reviews helped anyone who reads it.God bless :D

I\'m from Brazil and bought it from here and asked to be delivered in a hotel that a friend were in. So, I can not change the product.But, I was expecting that maybe the product was the same in a different bottle, I used this week and unfortunately the product ISN\'T the one that I bought. It has a good quality but is so so so far away from the one that I used before. "

The old bottle I used to order it says it is frizz control.  The new bottles I received do NOT say anywhere on them that they are frizz control, so Amazon should change their title and the Frizz Control label. "

My hair, previously thick and shiny became thin, dull and falling out. But this is not the worse part, my scalp felt burning, turned red and flakes of skin come out. It happened when I first used the new formula Pantene Classic (the one with the different smell for the long term users).It also happened to the rest of my family members. Same scalp problems and hair loss.Now I use Tresemme Naturals and so far, so good. I did try some natural and organic shampoos but did not work for different reasons. Too greasy, less clean, tangled... "

Previous a big John Frieda Blonde shampoo user, I was looking for something a little less expensive. I didn\'t really have high hopes using Pantene, but I\'ve been loving my hair since I started using it!I actually do see a difference in my blonde highlights since using this Pantene shampoo. They\'re brighter, more dimensional, and really do appear to sparkle. Also, my hair has felt super soft since I started using this shampoo.I do notice that my hair looks a lot better if I use Pantene every day. I generally like to switch up the shampoo I use on a daily basis, but my highlights tend to look best when I use this day after day.I guess you may not be eager to purchase a 3-pack if you haven\'t tried this shampoo yet, but you\'ll most likely want to before long! I use the conditioner in addition to the shampoo and recommend it as well. "

My hair is fine and I have a lot of it so it gets tangled easily. This conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft, weightless, and really easy to comb through right out of the shower.  It\'s amazing how well it works as a detangler.  Plus, I hate to wash my hair everyday and this conditioner leaves my hair looking almost as good on day two!  Many other conditioners I have tried have left my hair flat and oily on day two. If you have hair like mine, I highly recommend it. "

It has also never left a weird residue in my hair unless I accidentally over-saturated my hair with it (but that tends to happen with most hair products when used improperly). I only use it right after I get out of the shower, never on almost dry or dry hair. I also only spray it from the middle of my hair to the ends, never the roots as they don\'t need detangling! It has always detangled very well for me. I buy this often but it may be cheaper elsewhere.. Shop around first! "

I bought this on a whim the other day, figuring for the price if it didn\'t work I couldn\'t be that sorry. I have been THRILLED with the results! I spray it into my palms, then work it into the permed sections of my hair. It has a nice scent, doesn\'t leave my hair crunchy, and lasts all day long without having to reapply. As a previous reviewer said, you can use it every day without excessive buildup as well.I\'m usually a high-end product kind of girl, but this product has made me a convert. Thanks, Pantene! "

This arrived quickly and I am glad it came in a 3 pack as it was cheaper than going to my local store and buying them individually.

This \'treatment\' was extremely thin. I though it was going to be richer, creamier, and thicker. It was not at all.And I actually slept with my hair saturated in this stuff. I rinsed it out in the morning, & I felt no difference in the texture of my hair. And if there was a difference, it was not noticeable to the naked eye.Pantene conditioners are pretty good, but next time I will just stick to purchasing my conditioner in one of those longer slimmer bottles....its cheaper. :) "

So, when my hair is it\'s natural state & my \'kitchen\' has returned, that\'s when I gotta break out the hair grease. Cause the daily moisturizer just won\'t cut it.

I am Caucasian and suffer with uncontrollably dry hair since starting menopause. I could not even get a wide tooth comb through my hair. I have fine, colored, wavy hair. My regular Pantene products were not working for me anymore so out of desperation I tried this conditioner. I used it with my regular shampoo (Pantene Beautiful Lengths Shine Enhance Shampoo) and my hair was soft and smooth again. As soon as I applied it in the shower I could feel the difference. I will be using it from now on and plan to use my Pantene Beautiful Lengths Frizz Control Conditioner if this Relaxed and Natural becomes too \'heavy\' for my hair.

I have tried every product on the market from basics to high end and nothing ever worked even through the whole bottle to keep my hair from being a frizzy mess.

I tried to comb out my hair at the end of the day and ended up having to get in the shower and wash this stuff out.  The smell is cheap and overpowering, too.  What gives, Pantene??

The last time I used mousse it was the 80\'s Sebastian stuff and I was not looking to repeat a stiff, crunchy look again! My biggest worries were I didn\'t want it to smell bad, I wanted it to help hold my style through out the day, without flaking, looking stiff, and causing product buildup. At the store I smelled it, and was pleased. The next day I tried it cautiously with really no expectations at all.. boy was I surprised the smell was great. Now its been a month and I use it everyday. I don\'t use as much hairspray because this holds my style effortlessly without a sticky, lint attracting, stiff look. I would describe it as a brush able hold. "

(I thought I was ordering the pump kind...and figured I would give it a try instead of paying to have it shipped back.)  I really like the Pantene flexible hold pump hairspray, but was not pleased with the aerosol.  It left a lot of residue in my hair.  I am not used to aerosol, so maybe I used too much, but I tried using less and it didn\'t seem to do the job.  My hair looked fine, but the residue that was left made it hard to comb through, I had to pull it off with my fingers and my hair broke off.  I wash my hair daily, so hygiene wasn\'t the problem.  If you plan on using it, I suggest using a clarifying shampoo fairly often to help with the residue.  Another thing I didn\'t like was trying to spray my hair, because of the air, it would move my hair, so so I had to hold it in place to spray...don\'t have to do that with the pump kind!  If you like aerosol and you know how to use it...then you will probably have no problems with this hairspray! "

If a product is strong enough to hold ringlets in place, it usually leaves your hair \'crunchy\' when it dries. If a product dries and is soft and touchable, it usually doesn\'t hold well. Pantene Mousse for curly hair gives ringlets definition yet doesn\'t dry crunchy.  Apply to wet hair, comb to distribute, shape curls and let dry without touching. PLUS, when it\'s dry you can reactivate it with a spray of water and reshape your style. Most other products don\'t do that, and it\'s a definite bonus. Thank you Pantene! "

Initially frizzy & poofy the day I wash, but frizz mostly dies after i sleep on it.I usually alternate between wearing my hair curly, flat ironing it, or just doing nothing to it and tying it back in a bun.  But the past few months I had given up on wearing my hair curly because I was tired of all the bad products out there. They either did nothing to combat my frizzies, left my curls looking thin and \'scrunchy\', or left my hair just totally flat, which is quite the accomplishment because I have very long, thick hair with a lot of natural volume.My prayers are answered with the Pantene Pro-V Curly line!! I usually always try & use organic products on my hair (without sulfites and stuff) so I was hesitant to try this. But I\'m so glad I did. I bought the shampoo, the conditioner, the mousse & the hairspray. Together they are awesome! After my shower i wrapped my hair in a towel on top of my head, after about 10 minutes i undid the towel, then gently (i try not to toussle my hair around too much when its wet because i feel as if this makes it more frizzy) ran a moderate amount of mouse throughout my curls, separating them and making sure i coat all my hair.I let my hair air dry and occasionally twisted a few curls here and there with my finger and added a teenny tiny bit more mousse here and there where i thought it was starting to frizz up. My curls look extra curly, lots of volume, not crunchy at all & it helped with the frizz A LOT too. I used the hairspray VERY sparingly, i feel as if this is the only product in the line that may cause any sort of \'crunchiness\', so be careful with that one. Just don\'t use too much.I will use this line whenever i want to wear my hair curly (which will now be more often) but I will stick with my organic shampoos for all other times.Also, ***side note***, I was due for a trim when i tried this product so the ends of my hair were very frayed, and anyone with curly hair knows that just makes your hair look even MORE frizzy. So i used a dollop of \'nexxus pro mend  leave in treatment creme\' on my ends and...AMAZING! I know it doesn\'t really \'mend\' my split ends, but it does temporarily bind them together making them practically invisible (until i wash my hair again) and cuts down on almost all the frizz, so my ends look awesome. So i suggest adding that to your curly hair routine if you have split ends "

Her hair varies from wavy to loosely curly, depending on how long it is and how it\'s been washed and dried. The long parts tangle very easily, and the short parts curl and spring every which way, so I was hoping this conditioner would help eliminate the tangling while defining and controlling her curls a bit better.This conditioner did do a great job of detangling and smoothing my daughter\'s hair. I was able to comb it easily wet right out of the bath, and, better yet, the tangles stayed away and it remained easy to brush even after she\'d slept on it. The short, springy bits of her hair, however, haven\'t been any better under control with this conditioner. If anything, they seem harder to style into submission. So, though this was worth a try, we will probably be sticking with our leave-in Garnier Sleek & Shine smoothing milk to keep those bits restrained. "

It seems to be helping (in conjunction with the Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair series shampoo that I purchased separately). Her hair is less tangled and seems to be stronger and less dry, no small feat with our water, which seems to be extremely chlorinated and dries everyone\'s hair out a good bit. It of course smells great and seems softer to the touch as well. She\'s used much more expensive hair care products before, and these seem to be as good as any of those have been, if not better. While I don\'t think the effects are quite as dramatic as we were hoping for, I see that as a problem with our water rather than blaming it on this conditioner.

I found a Fekkai product not too long ago tht finally relaxed things enough to where my hair started to look normal and shiny again. But Fekkai products are spendy and I was still hoping to find something more budget friendly. This fits the bill. It is about 1/3 the price of the Fekkai product and it a comparable job. I used about a dime sized amount for shoulder length hair.I let my hair air dry, and my waves actually curled up quite nicely.

The biggest problem with long curly hair, besides women telling me it isn\'t fair for a guy to have curls when they don\'t (only heard this about two million times over the last four decades), is that it can be an ordeal to get a comb through after a few days without washing, such as backcountry hiking, etc.Enter Pantene conditioners. I just started using them a few months ago, so this one for curly hair is right up my alley. I am normally one of those weirdos who uses as much organic stuff as possible, both food and other stuff such as shampoos, toothpaste, etc. I just don\'t like putting manmade chemicals on my body or in the environment. But this stuff is so efficient that I need only a tiny bit to do all my hair, less than half compared to the Nature\'s Gate Organics I normally use. Plus, it detangles the biggest mess of knots in seconds! I swear, it takes me ten minutes of careful slow work to get a comb through with almost every other conditioner when me locks is all dreaded up, but this stuff somehow detangles them in no time flat.It\'s almost a miracle! For that kind of performance and efficiency, I\'ll deal with a few chemical components, especially as it takes so little of this stuff to do the trick. I still use my organic stuff more than half the time, but switching it up with this Pantene is working great for those times when I\'m in a hurry, or my hair is so knotty that I\'ll pull out big clumps while trying to detangle it.In short: if you have long, curly hair that often tangles, I haven\'t found a better conditioner that will detangle hair quicker, and with less product needed, than this stuff. Plus, it\'s really pretty cheap at 5 clams for a big bottle, which will last you dozens of uses. Very fairly priced indeed.Zero complaints from me about this stuff.Highly recommended."

Pantene warns you should only buy this product if you have curly hair, so it was really my bad for miscategorizing my hair as curly.

It\'s a good conditioner, but is it any better for my hair than say any other Pantene conditioner on the market?  I\'d have to say no.  I can\'t tell the difference between using this formulation or the regular Pantene.  My hair still requires me to put anti-frizz products in it, and it doesn\'t look any different after using this conditioner than another kind quite honestly.But that aside, the reason to buy this particular product is that this DOES leave hair soft and able to be combed right out of the shower (unlike some cheap conditioners) so that is why I give it 4 stars.  I don\'t believe there is any conditioner on the market currently that can truly manage the frizz of curly hair, and probably there never will be.

There\'s a certain segment of the population that perceives a certain elegance, an elan, if you will (or if you won\'t), a panache and flair to products named with a bon mot. Pantene... it sounds elegant(though it has no French meaning--not that it matters) and, by the way, it works pretty darn well.That\'s the most important thing here, Pantene \'FIne Hair SOlutions Flat to Volume\' Conditioner does what it says it will do: Add s bit of of volume (or the appearance of volume) by coating your hair strands, and adding sheen by aligning them.  IT reduce tangles, does not have an unpleasant smell, and basically has a reasonable price. Yes, you can go cheaper, and you might as well give those a try.While we\'re talking about language, what\'s with the name \'Flat to Volume\' --is it an awkward shorthand for \'Your hair looks flat, see, and this stuff will give it VOLUME. Therefore, Flat to Volume!\'  IT might annoy you for a few seconds, or perhaps this is Pantenese, and I\'m the one who should know better.Pantene comes out of the bottle fairly thick, so use just a little. Spread it around your hair, and it becomes much less viscous. I\'d recommend also that you rinse thoroughly.  I thought I detected a slight allergic reaction on my part (some itching) compared to not using it, but this is a tenuous connection and may have nothing to do with the product.  However, like all beauty/cosmetic products, it\'s probably better to buy ONE of these first to determine whether you have any adverse reactions.  Bottom line: I\'d buy it again, but it didn\'t blow me away either.  If you\'re not happy with the conditioner you use now and you tend towards the thin hair end of the follicle spectrum, then this is certainly worth a try. Bon chance a vous!

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos "

In this case, the product produce frizziness in both hot humid New Jersey weather and in hot dry New Mexico weather.As a result, we both tend to stick with the same conditioner and work around any problems that local conditions produce.

On the other hand, I personally didn\'t feel like it performed any magic either.In my opinion, the real problem with this shampoo (or any other similar product), is it becomes difficult to test them with out purchasing a $5 bottle. If you like it great, if not, then what do you do with the rest?So in the end, my advice is to either see if you can buy a sample size or to call the company and see if they are willing to send you a sample.

Since my hair isn\'t oily, I was a little concerned that the extra lift is reportedly achieved by removing oil from the hair. My hair doesn\'t look or feel dry after use, but still I thought I should add the companion conditioner just to be safe.  So far am pleased with it too.  Most conditioners make my hair hopelessly flat, but this product works well with the shampoo and doesn\'t counteract the shampoo\'s benefits.After using this shampoo, my scalp, which tends to be itchy, also feels good.  Since I use a lot of hair spray, I wonder if it is more effective at removing that residue from my scalp than other shampoos.

If deodorant has it, and hair spray has it, and you use perfume, how many fragrances do you need at one time?  But until more women feel this way, companies are likely compelled to add yet one more chemical to the mix.  To be REALLY fair, I would probably go to a store and read the ingredients on a lot more shampoo bottles.  Pro-V may not be any worse than other shampoos.While I am not chemically sensitive, others are.  But these people are probably buying products at the health food store instead of the drug store.

However, the best volumizing shampoo for my hair still is Sunsilk Volumizing Shampoo for fine hair that comes in the yellow bottle (not yet availble on Amazon). "

I recommend it.No allergic reaction thus far.  I have several skin allergies and sensitivities, and have experienced minor problems with a few other shampoos, and not-so-minor problems with several kinds of soap.  I will add a comment to this review if I have a later reaction or other problems.It has made my straight, flat hair look somewhat fluffy; it appears to have more body. Note that this was achieved by merely shampooing, followed by partial drying with a towel; no blow dryer used.The shampoo seems somewhat concentrated, not watered down.  It left my hair and scalp feeling thoroughly clean.  Unlike some shampoos, it has not left my hair feeling as if it were coated with anything greasy or heavy; just clean hair.While shampooing, I noticed only a very subtle scent, that was not specifically feminine nor masculine. It did not leave a noticeable scent my the hair.  A day later, if I bury my sensitive nose in my hair, I can just barely detect a vaguely plant-like scent, gender-neutral.P.S.  My husband also uses this shampoo, and it works well for him too. "

We\'ve adjusted his diet (more protien and vitamins), he\'s had his hair cut so that the weight of it at the crown doesn\'t stress his scalp, and we\'ve tried every full body shampoo on the market to no avail. I ordered this shampoo and it worked by the third washing! My son is absolutely thrilled! No, his hair is not instantly growing back. It does have more fullness, though, so his thinning crown isn\'t as noticable. We\'ll be sticking with this product for the foreseeable future! "
399,408,20100530,B004ISB3AG,5,"May 30, 2010",A11T807LX2EF00,"Rich lather, nice smell, great product",This is a great product.  It lathers richly and when working it into your hair it feels as if it keeps lathering as you work it in unlike other shampoos I have used that whimper out.It also has a nice smell that lingers beyond the shampooing.It leaves the hair feeling soft.  I don\'t know how much \'volumizing\' it does.... I couldn\'t really tell (must be the thinning hair...beyond help :) )All in all it is a great product that is worth considering using.  Can\'t go wrong with Pantene products. 
403,413,20100527,B004ISB3AG,5,"May 27, 2010",A3QY27FQHK453B,"Need volume, this is the place","I have always had very fine, flat hair that also requires frequent washings (every 2 days), this despite 42 years of coloring using a double process. I was very excited to see a new Pantene product. Since the 1970s (?) I have found this line of shampoos and conditioners not only gives me volume that looks like I have double the hair I actually have (you should see it tonight), but also improves the health of my hair, preventing and seemingly repairing breakage and split ends. I used to be plagued with split ends and now they are a thing of the past. I like this volumizing product because it enables me to do braids, thick ponytails and upswept styles with various accessories. My hair is also totally straight, so this product and other Pantene products have eliminated the need for a body perm. I will probably buy the product again. The only thing that has always bothered me is that Procter and Gamble insists on animal testing and I have six recued pet rats (often they are lab rats). I really wish they would stop this as their products are good and Pantene products are some of the best on the market. "
