5,5,20100703,B0014D08PO,5,"July 3, 2010",A30WY1WXTZ8TJJ,Please read if you are looking for the old formula green and white tube Pantene Restoratives Time Renewal,REVISED! Read if you want to find the new product that is the same ingredients as the old product formula!Pantene is trying to say this Shine Enhance conditioner is like the Old Restorative Time Renewal. IT IS NOT. If you are looking for the old formula then you need to buy the Pantene Pro-V Restore Beautiful Lengths FRIZZ CONTROL CONDITIONER. I had the tube from the old formula and found the ingredients in that and the ingredients in the Frizz Control Conditioner ARE THE SAME. I tried to email and call Pantene but they obviously don\'t know their own products and continue to give inaccurate information.AS FOR THE OLD FORMULA SHAMPOO:If you want the Old formula Restorative Time Renewal Shampoo then you will want to buy the NEW BEAUTIFUL LENGTHS SHINE ENHANCE SHAMPOO.I am trying to help because many of my family members and I used the old formula and were worried when they changed things. I have compared the ingredients and no matter what Pantene customer service tells you....these products I listed are the actual replacements. Try them you will see.OLD REVEIW:One of the best conditioners you will ever use for damaged hair. I am a professional stylist and have not found any line that works like Pantene Restoratives Time Renewal. Pantene has stopped making many of their products. What a shame. They said consumers were confused by all the choices. Call and complain. Their products were superior and did what they claimed. IF IT AIN\'T BROKE DON\'T FIX IT!,

Pantene Pro-V Restore gave life back to my hair. It is shiny and silky and even my hairdresser noticed that my \' hair is healthier\'. I only have to use a small amount after each shampoo. My hair is easy to style and I use the flat iron to smooth over certain areas after I shampoo and blow dry. It has cut out the need for me to be constantly restyling my hair. I have used many expensive salon conditioners that just seem to go down the drain. This Pantene product beats them all in price and actually does restore the hair to health.,

I first purchased the Blonde Expresssions shampoo that did an excellent job at \'Brighening\' my hair that seemed to dull (I didn\'t even have to re-dye it which I was planning to). It made my hair a  little staticy so I decided to give the conditioner a try and what a major difference!! My hair is already silky, and shiney even more so!! It must be the Kape seed oil in the conditioner, although this does not have the crystals that brighten your hair, the two used in conjunction with each other produce a great result!!",

I overall have great hair, but this just added to it. It also really did control the frizz. I was happy and content and I continued using it. Only, I am told that it is important to switch shampoos and conditioners occasionally, and I may listen to this advice, because, recently the Smooth Vitality conditioner hasn\'t been working so well on my hair. I must say, I like it better than many other Pantene products, especially the new line- Thin, Medium/Thick different solutions. But, I warn a buyer to reconsider purchasing more than two bottles of this product at a time. I buy my bottles one at a time, which works well when I am unsatisfied.",

86,88,20111026,B003EGSALS,5,"October 26, 2011",A24Z5TYLMYGNUE,First Color Protecting Shampoo,"This was my first time using a color protecting shampoo.  I chose Pantene because of the price per ounce and its claim to preserve color.  It develops a really nice lather, and a very light smell that does not linger long after showering/bathing.  I have not experienced any back acne that can occur (and has occurred for me) with different shampoos and conditioners.I had my hair colored before using this shampoo, and noticed every time I would wash my hair it looked like I was rinsing freshly colored hair!  Thus spurring me to look into wash my hair with some form of color protecting shampoo/conditioner.  I started using this product right after I got my hair relaxed and colored (first time ever trying to relax my loose curls), so I was extra concerned about damaged/dry hair.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again, as it has been just under 2 months, and I am now starting to notice the fading of color and my roots!  I have my hair colored 4 shades lighter than my natural color, with 5 shades and 3 shades lighter of highlights.  There was minimum hair breakage and loss after the span of these two months, and my relaxer is still going strong!I hope this helps for any other colored heads out there!  :)",

It has also never left a weird residue in my hair unless I accidentally over-saturated my hair with it (but that tends to happen with most hair products when used improperly). I only use it right after I get out of the shower, never on almost dry or dry hair. I also only spray it from the middle of my hair to the ends, never the roots as they don\'t need detangling! It has always detangled very well for me. I buy this often but it may be cheaper elsewhere.. Shop around first!",

Thoroughly brush your hair, and use conservatively. I\'ve used this on my hair, following the suggestions, with no problems. In the past, when I haven\'t, I\'ve had the same problems mentioned in previous reviews. It\'s a LIGHT detangler, not a miracle product if your hair is typically a tangled mess in the morning. I still use this on my daughter\'s morning tangle-prone hair with good results. It also leaves behind a hint of Pantene scent, which is a nice change over the usually \'fruity\' smell of detanglers.",

I\'ve spent at least $100 in expensive products only to be totally disappointed and frustrated. I bought this on a whim the other day, figuring for the price if it didn\'t work I couldn\'t be that sorry. I have been THRILLED with the results! I spray it into my palms, then work it into the permed sections of my hair. It has a nice scent, doesn\'t leave my hair crunchy, and lasts all day long without having to reapply. As a previous reviewer said, you can use it every day without excessive buildup as well.I\'m usually a high-end product kind of girl, but this product has made me a convert. Thanks, Pantene!",

I have tried many sorts of different products to tryand bring my hair \'back to life\' with no results. I came across the Pantene Pro-V products, and with trial and error I found that the thick-medium flat to volume done the best for me. I had been seeing this tub at walmart for the longest time and actually thought it was a type of vasaline. But after researching it I decided to try it.I can\'t believe how different my hair is. Whenever it\'s down, everyone compliments my hair. It feels so much lighter and the smell stays in longer. My hair has never been this healthy before.For my long hair, I can go through this product pretty quickly, so I limit myself by masagging already dampened strands into dry ones. Apply once a week, s I apply on my day off on Tuesdays, wait until I\'m through with all my house work and work outs, take a shower then apply this and leave it in for a few hours with my hair up.

There is no possible to this. It literally stripped my hair so bad that I wonder if I will ever get it quite right again. And I am not a woman of color, unless you call bleaching and coloring your hair blonde to pink to purple back to blonde or blue all year long.I really thought this product would help relax and condition my hair and somehow help it overcome the harshness from all the chemicals I used on it last year. I admit I was making progress with some herbal essence conditioner in the blue bottle that I used as a leave in and was honestly seeing improvemnts so far. I has shine & more length, less tangles, softness and hardly no frizzies.And then I saw this and assumed this was what I needed to get quicker instant results.WRONG! I wish I had never used this. I am set back 6 months now. My hair is dry, brittle, coarse, tangled, and frizzier than it ever was. This product has done more damage than my bleaching ever did!",

I used it the next day and was amazed.  It took the frizz out of my hair and made my hair feel so soft and nice.  It\'s my expectations that with further applications it will only improve my hair.  One thing, however, is that if your hair is really damaged and/or dry/frizzy, then leave it on for 30 min to 1 hour using a shower cap or plastic bag for really deep treatment.  It rivals any other moisturizing treatment that costs up to $50.  A great product at a fantastic price!  Try it.",

I am not used to aerosol, so maybe I used too much, but I tried using less and it didn\'t seem to do the job.  My hair looked fine, but the residue that was left made it hard to comb through, I had to pull it off with my fingers and my hair broke off.  I wash my hair daily, so hygiene wasn\'t the problem.  If you plan on using it, I suggest using a clarifying shampoo fairly often to help with the residue.  Another thing I didn\'t like was trying to spray my hair, because of the air, it would move my hair, so so I had to hold it in place to spray...don\'t have to do that with the pump kind!

The best results came after  something like Pantene\'s old Ice Shine shampoo -- though still, only average smoothing and mild taming of my locks, which definitely felt over-coated even after a thorough rinsing.I second what an earlier reviewer said about silicone -- it\'s a shortcut for curly hair that seems to pay you back later in buildup and less-than-satisfactory results in the long run, and it\'s disappointing to find it in this product.I wouldn\'t go out of my way to recommend this conditioner, though I\'ll keep it on hand to use when I\'m out of everything else!",

The biggest problem with long curly hair, besides women telling me it isn\'t fair for a guy to have curls when they don\'t (only heard this about two million times over the last four decades), is that it can be an ordeal to get a comb through after a few days without washing, such as backcountry hiking, etc.Enter Pantene conditioners. I just started using them a few months ago, so this one for curly hair is right up my alley. I am normally one of those weirdos who uses as much organic stuff as possible, both food and other stuff such as shampoos, toothpaste, etc. I just don\'t like putting manmade chemicals on my body or in the environment. But this stuff is so efficient that I need only a tiny bit to do all my hair, less than half compared to the Nature\'s Gate Organics I normally use. Plus, it detangles the biggest mess of knots in seconds! I swear, it takes me ten minutes of careful slow work to get a comb through with almost every other conditioner when me locks is all dreaded up, but this stuff somehow detangles them in no time flat.It\'s almost a miracle! For that kind of performance and efficiency, I\'ll deal with a few chemical components, especially as it takes so little of this stuff to do the trick. I still use my organic stuff more than half the time, but switching it up with this Pantene is working great for those times when I\'m in a hurry, or my hair is so knotty that I\'ll pull out big clumps while trying to detangle it.In short: if you have long, curly hair that often tangles, I haven\'t found a better conditioner that will detangle hair quicker, and with less product needed, than this stuff. Plus, it\'s really pretty cheap at 5 clams for a big bottle, which will last you dozens of uses. Very fairly priced indeed.Zero complaints from me about this stuff.Highly recommended."

It\'s a nice thick conditioner which controls the frizz and helps to detangle your hair in the shower.My hair type is thick and coarse and naturally wavy and tends to frizz. I usually use a leave in glossing cream after I wash my hair to detangle my hair without breakage and to keep my hair from becoming a frizzy mess.I live in Texas and right now the summer is coming on and it\'s hot and humid so it\'s the perfect recipe for my hair to frizz.The first time I used this conditioner was after swimming and there was no way I could run a comb through my hair without help.  After shampooing with my normal shampoo I was able to detangle my hair using the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner in the shower with no breakage. The conditioner is thick so it coats my hair well while in the shower but it doesn\'t feel as if the conditioner rinses completely out of the hair.However after stepping out of the shower and toweling off the conditioning results weren\'t there and I still felt as I needed something to help comb my wet hair.I believe the reason for this is, is because of one of the ingredients used in this conditioner called \'Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\'.  Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone is a silicone which is used to coat the hair and is not water soluable so it creates the \'conditioning\' feel you feel when in the shower while the water is pouring over your head but once you step out of the shower it doesn\'t feel the same because it leaves a film behind which doesn\'t allow the hair to slide easily between each other.On the other hand the \'film\' Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone leaves behind is suppose to help control frizz which so far it has done well for me.I have used other Pantene daily conditioners before in the past and unless it was a treatment conditioner such as Pantene\'s \'Deep Fortifying\' conditioners then Pantene\'s daily conditioners are usually rather thin and never worked very well .If you have used Pantene\'s treatment conditioners then you have a general idea of the consistency and results of the Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner.The one thing I really did not like is the smell of this conditioner.  The perfume is much stronger with this product than with Pantene\'s other products. It\'s not over whelming but noticeable stronger than another of Pantene\'s product I currently own.I am sensitive to scents so what I feel is too much isn\'t always the case for someone else.  If you are someone who doesn\'t like a lot of perfume you may want to give this product a whiff the next time you are at a grocery store before you purchase it here from Amazon.I do not know if I will continue using this product. This is my third wash using this conditioner and so far I am happy with the results but I\'m sensitive to products which contain sulfates and with anything that leaves a film behind a strong cleaner is definitely needed to help remove build up between uses. If I notice that my non-sulfate shampoos are sufficient in cleaning between conditioning with this  than I\'ll probably stick to using this otherwise I\'ll probably return to my normal routine.In conclusion I give it a 4 stars because I believe that Pantene\'s Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works well for those battling frizzy hair and after my hair dried it was extremely soft but I don\'t care for the perfume because I feel it\'s too strong.I like to give a Pro and Con breakdown for each of my reviews so here is the list for this one.Pros1.

And it does perform better than \'bargain\' brands like Suave.So the conclusion is that if you currently use more expensive salon products for fine hair, try this Pantene duo for similar performance at a cheaper price.  If you currently use a cheap brand of hair product, try Pantene and see if it works better for you.  Otherwise, if you are happy with your current product/price, we see no compelling reason to switch.",

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos",

In this case, the product produce frizziness in both hot humid New Jersey weather and in hot dry New Mexico weather.As a result, we both tend to stick with the same conditioner and work around any problems that local conditions produce.

I have to use some type of conditioner in order to comb it out without breaking it.

My hair felt softer right away.  After drying, it was easy to style either using a curling iron or just blowing dry.  The conditioner had a nice light fragrance that wasn\'t overpowering.

There is nothing truly special about it. The scent is very \'right off the shelf of the drug-store\'. It smells like every other bottle of pantene to me, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing. It is what it is!The conditioner doesn\'t seem to phase my completely unruly, pin straight, fine yet dense hair. I have the strangest hair. Some days it feels very thick and voluminous and others it feels very flat and light. I want a conditioner that adds a nice density to my fine strands but doesn\'t cause my scalp to get oily after a few hours. This doesn\'t do the trick for me.I am also turned off by the fact that this is NOT sls free. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the cheapest method for a company to get it\'s product lathering or textured a certain way and it is literaly the same stuff they use in car wash soaps and degreasing chemicals for car engines. In the same way as it dissolves the grease on the car engines, sodium lauryl sulfate also dissolves the oils on your skin, which can cause a drying effect, which in turn might cause an overproduction of oils, as is my case. It is also well documented that it denatures skin proteins, which causes not only irritation, but also allows environmental contaminants easier access to the lower, sensitive layers of the skin.Products with SLS are not only dangerous for the skin but they can also effect a person\'s hormones and lead to various forms of cancer. So, in the long run, it is better to invest the five bucks you would pay for a tube of this stuff and get something that is CLEARLY marked SLS-FREE. That said, for those less conscious or interested in the harm that SLS can cause...this conditioner will probably be a staple in your shower. It smells fresh and does it\'s job OK for that everyday-pantene price.It\'s not something I would ever buy or endorse though.",

I would definitely purchase this again.",

We\'ve adjusted his diet (more protien and vitamins), he\'s had his hair cut so that the weight of it at the crown doesn\'t stress his scalp, and we\'ve tried every full body shampoo on the market to no avail. I ordered this shampoo and it worked by the third washing! My son is absolutely thrilled! No, his hair is not instantly growing back. It does have more fullness, though, so his thinning crown isn\'t as noticable. We\'ll be sticking with this product for the foreseeable future!",

I was very excited to see a new Pantene product. Since the 1970s (?) I have found this line of shampoos and conditioners not only gives me volume that looks like I have double the hair I actually have (you should see it tonight), but also improves the health of my hair, preventing and seemingly repairing breakage and split ends. I used to be plagued with split ends and now they are a thing of the past. I like this volumizing product because it enables me to do braids, thick ponytails and upswept styles with various accessories. My hair is also totally straight, so this product and other Pantene products have eliminated the need for a body perm. I will probably buy the product again. The only thing that has always bothered me is that Procter and Gamble insists on animal testing and I have six recued pet rats (often they are lab rats). I really wish they would stop this as their products are good and Pantene products are some of the best on the market.",

It really did not matter on the brand: Paul Mitchell, Redkin, Matrix, Aveda or Nexxus, the results were all pretty disappointing, as all products delivered similar, unsatisfactory results.I never tried ANY Pantene products, although my husband has used their shampoo and conditioner for years.  When I finally tried Pro-V Fine Hair shampoo, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, my hair is still fine, but it feels and looks fuller for longer than it did after using other products. My hair is color treated, and I think my hair look smoother and feels softer as well.The shampoo has a nice, but not overpowering smell, and the price is very reasonable compared to salon brand products. There are always coupons for Pantene products in the newspapers as well for additional savings.  If you are looking to try something new for your limp or fine hair, this product is worth a try. RECOMMENDED - 4.5/5 stars.",

When I received the package, I noticed that it did not look anything like the real thing! It has the name in English, French, and I believe in Spanish. In the REAL product at the store, it only has it in English. It also has a different smell. Overall, I would still continue to order this product because it works, my hair is usually very frizzy and after I started using this it has made it less frizzy, and a lot more softer. Only thing that bugs me is that they would sell it as the real thing but in reality it isn\'t.",

I didn\'t notice any additional changes except it weighing down my hair (I have medium, not thick hair, so this may have something to do with it).This doesn\'t help with blowdrying, it doesn\'t really help protect your hair, it just coats it without helping mend my split ends. Disappointed. If you\'re looking to mend your hair, look to Nexxus\'s new ProMend line.",

Many conditioners I have tried in hot humid weather make my hair greasy in some areas and dry in others. This conditioner is nourishing on ends and doesn\'t cling to the scalp area or mid hair section. It rinses clear and doesn\'t leave a residue.Although this works well in humidity-I have not had great results in dry weather, especially cold dry weather, with this conditioner. The water content seems to be very high in the product-and my hair became very stiff when used in colder weather (even though my hair was completely dry), and seemed slightly frozen.Hair type: lightened (blonde), greasy roots, dry/frazzled ends, split ends, thick, thin shaft",
