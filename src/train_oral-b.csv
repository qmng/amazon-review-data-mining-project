The battery just died on mine after 2 years and I couldn\'t be bothered to break out the soldering iron to replace it so I ordered a new \'handle\' for $62 shipped (toothbrush base minus the charger and brush tips.) I would skip 5000 with the Smartguide LCD and get the 4000 series instead. The LCD is a seriously useless gimmick IMO since the brush beeps every 30 seconds to let you know to move onto the next section. If you can live with expense ($40-45 a year) these brushes are great and, if it saves one costly dental procedure, it pays for itself."

The others do too but this claims to have an advantage for polishing teeth. I have no idea if it actually does but the concept is good.
1499,1534,20091125,B001CX4JSS,5,"November 25, 2009",A2ODH0R7S2Z60Q,Excellent toothbrush for a reasonable price,"I was a little hesitant about buying this brush, since it was smaller than typical electric brushes and because it is a \'store brand.\'  I originally bought an \'advanced\', but not \'elite\' model from my dentist several years ago on her recommendation.  It worked fine for me for many years.  But it seemed no matter how often I brushed and flossed, I could never get a compliment from her.  I eventually went back to my old habits.  When it finally died, I broke open its Fort Knox-like enclosure only to discover two rechargeable AA batteries.  I vowed not to give them any more of my business, if I could avoid it.Then, I bought this one.  I liked the size, though it took a little while to adjust to the feel of it.  The brush also felt a little different.  I eventually got used to it and was quite satisfied with it.  The real amazement was when I went in for my checkup.  I hadn\'t been flossing that regularly, but I got the best checkup ever!  They were actually impressed with the progress I\'d made.  I can\'t recommend this brush enough, especially if you have a history with periodontal problems."
1602,1643,20080828,B001CX4JSS,3,"August 28, 2008",ATMQEI1LKR6VB,Too much of a good thing?,"While the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is a nice toothbrush that will definitely get your teeth clean and comes with many nice features, I found it too powerful. Even on the gentlest settings, it made my teeth vibrate in an uncomfortable way.Years ago I wrote an article comparing different toothbrushes and toothpastes. I asked several dentists if they had any preferences. One thing I was told by two dentists is that electric toothbrushes are bad, because people tend to brush too hard when using them, ruining the protective enamel on their teeth.Well, I like to judge things for myself, so I did get one, an Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush. And I like it. I\'m careful not to press down too hard when I use it, and I don\'t believe it\'s harming my teeth. I\'m not as confident about that with the Pulsonic. I also prefer the battery-operated Advance over something that takes up more space around the sink and takes up an outlet. I get compliments for how white my teeth are, and I think the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is partly responsible.The Pulsonic is probably a better toothbrush, but considering the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is just $14.99 and does the job for me, I can\'t say it\'s worth the difference."

Works great, just as good as the previous generation Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush, which died after approx. 4+ years of use.  This one is about half the size of the previous generation, and equally powerful.I did own a Philips Sonic Tooth Brush about 8 years ago, but it only lasted two years before it broke.This one never seems to require a charge, after about two weeks of use I put it back on the charger out of habit.Before ordering, I figured I would give the Arm & Hammer Sonic Spin Brush a try (available at my local pharmacy for approx. $30).  The difference can be compared to a Pinto vs. a Lexus.  The Sonic Spin Brush worked okay, and probably if I had never owned a real Sonic Toothbrush, I would have kept it, but it was not the same.  The Sonic Spin Brush felt cheap and poorly implemented.  You definitely get what you pay for.Now, only time will tell if the Oral-B Pulsonic will last as long as its predecessor, so 4 stars, not 5."

Can feel a little bit of the floss action - not sure how much it\'s actually doing but can feel some action there.  Generally work fine - if they\'re the same price as the regular heads I\'d probably choose these.

Excellent price/performance point - does the job without fanfare (timers, etc) and functions very well.  One issue:  instructions call for running it down before recharging.  I\'m not sure why.  I did not do this with previous version and had no problems so I don\'t expect any with this one.Another point:  Buy replacement brush-heads from Amazon - much cheaper than local drug store."

The battery and travel case are great on trips. I personally really like the extra display that displays your brush time, settings, and quadrants, and am glad I got the SmartSeries 5000 for it. I was able to get it for about 35 dollars with all rebates that were offered at the time, which made it a very easy decision to buy this."

It is very good.I had to return it because it stopped working the first day I got it. I ordered a replacement and it worked well for 2-3 weeks and then stopped working, so I had to return it too.

Although a bit awkward as it is not stream-lined, it is light weight. But what cinched the deal - and is the result of the five star rating - is the high praise I received from my dentist. After using the product, on my next exam, he noticed a visible reduction in the amount of plaque. Subsequently, he now also endoreses the Oral-B to his other patients."

This toothbrush is part of a Chinese Government Conspiracy to clog our landfills with Consumer Junk.  :)  The unit wouldn\'t work right out of the box.  Some issue with the charger, appearently.  Braun would want me and others to believe that the quality issues with this unit are just an isolated incident.  Sorta like a lightning strike, I.E. an act of God.  Ignorance might be bliss but knowledge also is power so as a Reliability Engineer I know that failures such as these quite simply need not occur.  I conclude that Braun either doesn\'t care about quality, or has organizational issues that precludes implimentation of a quality control program. Anyway, I will ship the unit back for a refund and continue to use my 10 year old Sonicare."

So when I first turned it on, I was afraid as it sounds like a dentist\'s drill!  However, I soon adjusted and am now quite the fan.  It comes with a two minute timer which sort of stutters when the time is up.  And with this gadget those two minutes I have found simply fly by.  What I most like, though, is that this toothbrush really does seem to get in deep between all the nooks and crannies and cleanse my teeth very well.  I also like that I\'m able to reach back and even brush my wisdom teeth and get them clean.  Something I couldn\'t do with a manual toothbrush.  Since this is my first electric toothbrush I had to learn to adjust also to the fact that I don\'t have to press down hard and push like with a manual toothbrush.  This one really does the work for you.  And I have found it best to let it linger some on each tooth.  And the results are that my teeth really do look and feel clean.  I\'m quite pleased with this gadget and I do very much recommend it.  It comes with a replacement toothbrush head as well, however, you have to figure out a way to store it on your own.  As it doesn\'t come enclosed in any type of case or anything like that.  I currently have mine wrapped in a paper towel.  Overall, though, I am most pleased and happy with this toothbrush.P.S.  After using this product for more weeks I\'ve discovered fine lines creeping in on the edges of my lips.  I noticed that with this toothbrush the toothpaste seems to gather there and I think the toothpaste was burning my skin.  I have very sensitive skin.  But, nonetheless, I do recommend that users of this toothbrush use a very gentle toothpaste.  So as to avoid what happened to me."

With the subscription discounts and coupons, it was around half as expensive as the local store - well worth the risk. Thankfully, the heads we got weren\'t fake - they had the serial numbers, two colored rings and no color bleeding. I\'m not sure if the fakes are off the market or not, but if you\'re on the fence just order, then give Amazon a call if the ones you get aren\'t genuine..."

The reason I give it 4 stars, is strictly the price. Retail on genuine brushes are between 5 and 8 dollars each, which is ridiculous, whereas these are just over a dollar each. I can put up with a little less quality, for a huge savings."

3048,3134,20120501,B0043VYSI2,3,"May 1, 2012",A2PTVWCCR00WMC,Fantastic toothbrush but with outdated battery technology,"As fantastic as this toothbrush is, it is incomprehensible to me why Braun provides a 1980s-type NiCd rechargeable battery in this toothbrush that comes with infamous memory disaster (always wait until battery is fully depleted before you recharge).  And then, it takes 9 hours to fully charge the battery.  In this price category the toothbrush should come with a Lithium-based rechargeable battery that provide constant power (i.e., speed), and not like this NiCd battery that becomes slower and slower.  5 stars for the toothbrush itself, but no star for the outdated battery technology, makes it 3 stars in my book maximum."

421,429,20060205,B0000C4KJM,5,"February 5, 2006",A1N3OY8O53MI34,A decent size of toothbrush,"I find that this toothbrush is able to get to all the places where a toothbrush needs to get, and the larger size of head allows more efficient cleaning. Now you might suggest that I prefer it because I\'ve got a big mouth, but that\'s not the case (surprised?). I find smaller toothbrushes take too long to get the job done, even allowing 2-3 minutes per brushing.The Oral B 60 brushes are hard to find in stores (and I do look), so a 6 pack lasts me a while. The brushes aren\'t too soft or hard, and my dentist thinks my old teeth aren\'t in all that bad condition, and seem to be reasonably well cleaned. I even give away the toothbrush he hands out at each visit and use the Oral B 60 instead."
425,433,20120415,B0002KHTG6,3,"April 15, 2012",A2WJWSIEPYWEDL,Harsh on gums,"I\'m conflicted about these toothbrush heads.  I do think they make a small yet noticeable difference on my teeth , I found them to be VERY hard on my gums (even though I don\'t normally have sensitive teeth/gums).I will use these occasionally (until the 3-pack I bought is used up), but these are not my regular toothbrush heads.  I like others much more, and could live without these no problem.So, all in all, these were OK but I will not repurchase.  A toothbrush needs to be practical for your whole mouth.  People with sensitive gums should definitely stay away."

However, the wrong items were shipped; we ordered the Precision Clean brush head but received the Soft head. The supplier contact us immediately offered for free exchanges and free shipping. We politely refused the offer and pointed out that we still be able to use the products, the Soft Heads may even cost more. We were surprised and more than happy to receive apologized emails from Amazon and the supplier along with [] for our inconvenience.Thank you for a great customer service !!!"

It is worth the money.  It has a timer that will vibrate after 30 seconds and two minutes.  The head is small enough to get around every tooth.  It cleans wonderfully.  I am glad I decided to buy this.

I had to buy a new one recently after I took my old Professional Care model to France and overheated it a bit...so, I bought this Smart model, since it was offered with a [...] rebate and seemed to be the latest in the Professional Care series.I have been using it a month now, and am quite happy with it\'s teeth-cleaning ability. I use all 3 different brush heads provided, but mainly stick to one speed, the daily cleaning.  I use the unit set on \'airplane\' mode, as a wireless display of where I am at what time in my mouth is just silly, a waste of a battery, and needless exposure to rf waves to boot.  One other downside is that the charger is in the plug, which sticks out @ 3 1/2 inches from the outlet, not a good look for a small bathroom counter.So, in future I will look for a non-Smart model and will remain perfectly stupid and happy with it. Hopefully that will not be for years."

I first bought this a year ago, and it\'s been sitting in my room idle for a variety of reasons.  Indifference.  Inertia.  Suspicion of its efficacy.  Fear of getting electrocuted.My dentist bothered me again during my most check-up this August, and I finally started using this electric toothbrush, and the difference between this and a regular Oral B toothbrush is night and day.Now, if you\'re an obsessive-compulsive and patient brusher, you probably don\'t need this.  As long as you hit all the spots slowly and methodically, your teeth are going to be white.  But if you happen to be like me -- impatient and erratic -- then this electric toothbrush is a godsend.I still need to cut back on the tea and fruit juices though."

I\'ve been using Oral-B for years. My second one was still functional, but now that I use rechargeable AA and AAA batteries, I preferred to get rid of the charging stand. It takes space, adds clutter, and occupies an outlet -- and it\'s especially inconvenient if you can\'t keep it near the sink. This version of the Oral-B was just the ticket! My favorite brush is now free and easy without need of a charging stand. This product is exactly what I expected and wanted, so I have no complaints. And the price is just a steal!Just a word about brush heads. There are various options for Oral-B, but basically two main ones: Precision Clean and Dual Clean. Precision Clean only has the round group of bristles at the tip of the brush. The correct way to use this brush head is to run it slowly over each tooth. This cleans very thoroughly. For people who aren\'t comfortable changing the technique they\'re accustomed to with non-powered toothbrushes, there is the Dual Clean. This brush head has an extra group of bristles that allows you (if you want) to use the Oral-B more like a regular non-powered toothbrush."

Turned out I needed a new toothbrush and saw that the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 came with a $50 rebate so I decided to get it. I am so happy I did... You can tell the difference right away between a basic toothbrush and this one. For one thing, it has so many features that the basic doesn\'t have and you can tell the difference in your teeth. The motor is much more powerful and leaves your eeth feeling great. You have different modes to brush your teeth and the little timer helps you keep track on how long you have to brush your teeth. I just got my $50 back and it\'s been such a worth purchase. I definitely recommend this product to anyone!"

My teeth felt \'dentist clean\' after brushing for a couple minutes. Before this, I\'ve used a variety of regular toothbrushes and spent a lot of money on the latest toothpastes but my teeth didn\'t feel completely clean unless I went for a cleaning at the dentist. With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh. The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline. It\'s not a substitute for flossing, but an additional help. My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven\'t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power. If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better. I\'m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea). The charge lasts for about a week, depending on how often it\'s used. For around $30, this powerful toothbrush is an excellent value."

However, when I travel I take this one with me because it is compact and has the same type of brush head that I use on the electric brush.As far as I am concerned this brush manages to do a terrific job with very little effort. The small brush head can get into the smallest places and get to all that nasty debris that collects. My teeth also feel ultra clean. I usually floss at least once  a day after brushing and I am always a little surprised by how little excess debris is present after using this brush.My only complaint with this brush is the relatively short life span before batteries need to be replaced.

While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  My last toothbrush had a tiny LED screen built into the brush that displayed battery life.  However, after about a year, this screen shorted out and became useless. The unit eventually just gave out and I had to replace it.I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard. I wish I actually had this feature years ago because I was brushing too hard and scrubbed away much of my enamel.It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  There are better brushes for you gums.  However, if I could give half stars, I would give this unit a 4.5/5 star rating.Oral-B was also running a promo at the time; if you buy an qualifying unit, you can receive an 50% mail in rebate.  So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  So for $40, this is a great brush.  This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard no matter which unit/brand you buy. I also like that it takes up a small amount of space on my countertop; I wish the power cord was detachable for easier storage though - not a big deal however.All in all, it is a good brush.  It is a straightforward unit that has just the right amount of features without paying an arm and a leg."

I like it a lot as I feel my teeth are cleaner and fresher when I am done.  I like the dual action brush as it cleans a larger tooth surface and massages your gums.  This toothbrush removes more plaque than a regular toothbrush and does a better job of polishing your teeth.  My dentist recommends Oral B and so I tried one and use it daily.I have changed the brushing head many times and the base even uses the rotating single action head if you can\'t find the dual action one.  The toothbrush has charged for over 3 years with the inductive charging stand and the batteries are still good.  I am happy with the quality of the product and the way it cleans my teeth.  I recommend it to you as a good product.

Another dentist recommended the Phillips Sonicare but it is so much more expensive that I chose to stay with the Oral B which uses the same rotary bush system that a dentist uses to clean teeth!

These toothbrushes also feature  electronics that keep the motor voltage constant - and hence maintain optimal orbital brushing speed - even as the battery voltage declines as they discharge. So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops. So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries! This feature also means despite the lower voltage of using 2x 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, you get the same brushing speed and power as using 2x 1.5V Alkaline cells. This is great! as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.Build quality of the units is great as you\'d expect for a Braun, even for a cheaper unit. The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section. This guarantees moisture vapour can\'t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term service.The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can\'t get into the internals.The 2-minute timer is a nice feature. At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing but if you wan\'t to keep brushing, you can as it doesnt turn the motor off.Overall this brush is great, especially for the price. The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific. The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber. All these problems are remedied with this Braun model."

It comes with three toothbrush heads: sensitive, floss, whitening. The sensitive brushhead one will forever remain in the closet. Really unless you have someone in your family who has different teeth from you, either you will be using the floss or the sensitive, not both, so really it comes with two brushheads, not three.2. It took me a while to read the manual, I didn\'t think it was all that clear on what I was supposed to do (I\'ve never owned one before) but it turns out that it\'s a lot easier than the manual suggests.3. I\'m not certain if the pressure signal works appropriately. After starting to use it, my teeth started to become more sensitive. Even though the timer thing didn\'t indicate I was brushing too hard, I decided to use less pressure and my teeth stopped being as sensitive.4. It doesn\'t tell me anything about usage of toothpaste. I find that the paste runs out when i brush one quadrant and I have to restart the process.But overall, it does exactly what it\'s supposed to do, clean your teeth!"
2111,2161,20110424,B002HWS9GG,3,"April 24, 2011",A1VUN4JU731CBH,Tedious Timer,"Having had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and liking it, I was looking to get another Oral B when the time came to replace it. I decided on this model because it had the separate timer - something I had come to really miss on my older model. It had the timer on the handle only, making it impossible to check during operation. And while it buzzed after each 30-second segment was up, I often didn\'t really remember whether it had already buzzed to signal that the full two minutes had been reached and kept brushing longer than that.But it turned out that the separate timer on the Oral-B 5000 is all around tedious to operate. First, one has to remove the timer stand, then the battery cover because the buttons to set the timer are hidden underneath the cover. Whether this was a misguided attempt at keeping the design minimalist I don\'t know. But having to fumble with this already didn\'t work for me - I can\'t help but wonder: What were they thinking?In the end, the timer never worked anyway - it is set to demo mode when one takes it out of the box, and the buttons in the battery compartment also serve to set it up for regular operation. Trouble was that my timer could not be reset to normal operation. It kept cycling through demo mode time and again until I gave up and returned the whole thing.As to the toothbrush itself, it seemed to work great, just as I was used to from the previous model (and the only reason I gave this 3 stars at all). But since I had gotten this particular one because of the timer, I decided to order the 4000 model instead and just put up with the timer in the handle - at least I know this will work.One last word: My old Oral-B toothbrush came with a nice, very sturdy fabric case. This one in contrast has a rather flimsy plastic travel case. Another disappointment. My conclusion: Too expensive for what it offers."

I\'d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it\'s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you\'re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.I have one implant, and some \'erosions\' on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it\'s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.Don\'t throw away that manual toothbrush, though.  There is still one mouth maintenance chore that the Oral-b does not handle well -- brushing of your tongue.  The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \'tooth\' brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  If you check my other reviews, you\'ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed."

Every 30 seconds it makes a little pulsation, which allows you to time how long you clean each toothy-hemisphere.  (30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right) This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.  Like lying on the couch with the dog and the boyfriend.  Comfortable, perfect.I swear my teeth are cleaner looking.  I don\'t swing with that whitening paste, it ruins your enamel. I think this brush makes the difference. My gums feel awesome and healthy.Seriously, what have I been doing all my life??"

56,57,20050308,B00006ANDJ,5,"March 8, 2005",A2WXIJTI5PEV9N,Making a dent in the war against tooth decay,"This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it\'s kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

2350,2405,20101008,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 8, 2010",AIY2GUK4HEMMU,Very Pleased,"First off this is my first automatic toothbrush, so take what I review about the toothbrush with a grain of salt.I decided to buy this only because there is a 50% rebate from Oral-B with the purchase.  Normally I wouldn\'t buy a toothbrush for $100, but in a few weeks when I get $50 back, it will justify me spending $50, even though that seems a little steep for a toothbrush.  But nevertheless, its a steal of a deal right now.So onto the product. Overall I am very pleased with it.  My teeth felt amazingly smooth and clean after the first brushing.Since I\'m not an automatic toothbrush guru, I am not sure of the sizes and noise of others.  In my own opinion, I feel like it is a tad heavy and large.  But once again, its got a motor and battery in it unlike my manual toothbrush.I read other reviews about the base of the unit and storage compartment for the brush heads being too large.  I however have to disagree with that.  The base unit is just larger than the base of the toothbrush, as the toothbrush sits in it to charge.  The storage part holds 4 tips and snaps to the base.  Once again, I don\'t know how others compare, but to me the size of it seems perfect for my counter space (about 8 sq ft).The plug however seems large.  But oh well, I\'m also not an electrician so I don\'t know why it needs to be that big.The Wireless Smartguide is pretty cool as well.  It gives you a timer and choice of count up or count down modes and a ingenious idea of having 4 zones (for each section of teeth).  This 4 zone thing blinks for 30 seconds indicating which zone you should be brushing in and provides a visual timer of when to move on.  It makes it idiot proof for brushing for the correct time.  I find myself brushing for about 4 minutes because the 2 minutes fly by which is a plus to the health of my teeth and gums.I am really impressed with the \'extras\'.  Really, when you buy electronics you ALWAYS need to get your own batteries for it.  With this, the Wireless Smartguide came with 2 AA batteries in it, as well as 2 more.  4 batteries!!! You never get batteries included let alone EXTRA batteries.  Ha, needless to say, that\'s coll Oral-B.  You also get 2 brushing heads, the normal flossification head and the pro-white head.  That\'s another plus with getting another brush head included in the package.  You also get the travel case.  Which I haven\'t used yet, but still cool.I have read others complain of the \'roughness\' of the brushing.  The manual does state that it can take time for your teeth to become used to the brush and your gums may bleed some.  I however had no problems gum bleeding or feeling like the toothbrush was too rough.The only negative I can say about this toothbrush is sometimes while brushing the chewing surfaces of my teeth, the back of the brush head hits the opposite chewing surface.  It doesn\'t hurt, but it doesn\'t feel great either.  Guess I just need to remember and learn to keep my mouth open more while brushing.All in all, great product and would definitely recommend to my family and friends during the promotion period where you get 50% back.  Can\'t wait for my rebate check!"

It was a loud and eventually became sloppy in holding the spindle from turning around requiring the handle to constantly be rotated. It still was very effective and still holds it\'s charge without fail.Long story short, I did research and ended up choosing the professional care 5000 over the 4000 as a replacement.  The sticker shock held off the purchase until I found a 50% rebate and free priority prime shipping.  I really prefer the \'polishing\' heads and bought 6 extra.  Net cost was about $55 which is about + price of the additional brush heads.There is no comparison between this and our old model.  It is quiet and has some cool features.  There is a visible battery (fuel) gage on the handle, and a transmitter to communicate with a seperate remote unit.  This thing times you, is a clock, and even blinks if you brush too hard. The travel case is well constructed and useful. Buy one...rebate took about 2 weeks...mine was a $55 check.PROS:  quiet- cool features- teeth feel like you just had a cleaning...squeek and all- noticed definate whitening almost immediately- find myself brushing more often by choice, angled position allows makes getting to back teeth a non-issue. We love it and highly recommend it.Check out the polishing heads which have a yellow rubber center. It saves the outer bristles and you still get more than adequate flossing and unbelievable plaque removal. It really extends head life especially if you brush hard, like my wife. Trust me on this; I smoke cigars.NEGATIVES:  Really none..somewhat pricey heads, but more gental than even soft hand brushes."

You can not change the battery, and you can not send it in for the battery to be replaced. Go out and buy a new one is all you can do. Do you how much the battery in there is actually for.....$6-7 at the Batteries plus and $2-3 online. Yup, they want you to dump a $100+ product because they don\'t want you to replace that cheap battery in there. Refer to page 10 of your manuals.But, a lot of you have already bought this product. No worries, simply google it. There are plenty of videos. The process is pretty simple and can be accomplished with just a screw driver and the triangular tool on the charger. If you are careful prying away the contacts heat glued to the stock battery you won\'t even need soldering. The rigid spring in there holds it all in place. Suck on that Braun."

The outer bristles are raised about two millimeters above the middle ones- meaning that you have to gnash them into your gums just to make contact between the middle bristles and your teeth. Then there\'s the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush. It\'s like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face. There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience."

The next size head down is a 40.The texture is SOFT, not Medium texture, and you should optfor the SOFT, rather than the Medium; the SOFT (this one) isplently firm to do the job without mushing down and wastingyour time just going through the motions without connecting.Looking at the bristles head-on (staring at the tips of thetufts, with the plastic head in the rear), the arrangementof the tufts (the pattern) is an oval. Normally I personallydo not like such an arrangement, preferring instead a solidrectangle, so as to purchase more surface area with which toconnect to the teeth and gums. In the case of the CrossAction(manual) toothbrush\'s configuration, the lack of \'corners\' tothe brush is not noticeable, unlike other oval-shaped heads.Reason for this is two-fold (am not a tech, this is personalconjecture or observation): the outer \'rim\' or border of thebrush\'s bristles is resilient (doesn\'t give easily, no mush),AND the very tip of the brush head has a special arrangementof slightly LONGER bristles (color: solid white, no bluishindicator layer) that reach v-e-r-y effectively into netherregions of the mouth (back molars?) to route out the bugs &leftover food particles. All you need is SOFT, not Medium;should you utilize a Medium (texture rating, not size) one,you\'d gouge your gums and whatever else is in there. You\'llget enough traction and friction and devil-exorcising actionwith a SOFT CrossAction (manual) toothbrush.Do not confuse the CrossAction with the Advantage series ofOral-B manual toothbrushes; although the Advantage line hasa similar appearance (shape and combination of features), Iventure to tout the CrossAction as being superior in termsof achieving results (getting one\'s teeth and gumline cleanin the least amount of time, with the minimum of dexterity).In case you DO wish to order a single Advantage toothbrushin the same order (to compare the two brushes), go to theSearch box and either type or copy/paste the Amazon ID# forthat style, which is ASIN: B0000C4KJG. Type B0000C4KJG w/othe \'ASIN:\'. That\'ll get you to the page which concerns theSKU 086736 (full head, soft). At the time of this review ittakes two cents more to total 25 bucks, to avoid shipping.The UPC/NDC (666 barcode) number is 3-00410-60639-8 for theCrossAction 60 Soft; that\'s for ONE brush. Six-pack sleeveshave a similar but different number, but you don\'t need thatto double-check the #53 CrossAction in a retail store. Whenyou wish to hunt down our brush in the haphazardly sortedretailer\'s toothbrush rack, home in on the reddish number53, located at the extreme tip of the J-hook tab at the TOPof the individual blister package. This\'ll save you gettingfrustrated or confused when rummaging through the toothbrushrack in search of WORDS. Find Oral-B and then find the 53...Amazon saves you money (per individual toothbrush) comparedto what the stores charge (about 4 smackers each), but youcan get your mitts on a sample in a retail Rx before you doorder (in case you prefer to SEE and heft what you\'ll getas a six-count from Amazon).The two downsides are- the blister packaging is not really biodegradable (tough);- the parent company is B-I-G on animal testing (laboratoryexperiments, usually redundant, on sentient rabbit eyes...).The Oral-B CrossAction style of manual toothbrush, althoughmore expensive than shlock-brand models, is well worth themonetary outlay. The squeaky-clean satifaction will SPOILyou, and you won\'t settle for a manual toothbrush of lesserquality in the future.This brush does not include the rubber bristles along theouter edge of similar toothbrushes: they are supposed tomassage your gums, but IMHO the regular CrossAction doesenough work on both the teeth and also the gumline to actas a do-it-all toothbrush (no, it does not floss!).BTW, your dentist probably never has mentioned during allthe precious moments that you have spent together THAT THEGUMS ACT AS AN O-RING GASKET SEAL between your teeth andthe jaw-bones. Maintaining the gums (such as with a brush)preserves the GUMS, which in turn will protect your teethROOTS and jawBONES from bacteria and foreign matter. Youneglect your gums when in your prime, and you\'ll reap amess of AVOIDABLE trouble with your roots and bones later.Perhaps you might even suggest to your dentist that s/hebe more proactive in making patients AWARE of the role ofthe (silent) g-u-m-s in protecting the base of out teeth!Parting comment: sugar rots teeth, but the bone particleswithIN refined sugar are the #1 cause of various cancers.This according to avatar Sathya Sai Baba, who should know."

2588,2648,20101009,B003UKKH6O,2,"October 9, 2010",A3FEGTOLCWXSV4,It works but is not particularly usable,"Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000). The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.In particular, note that the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per second, and does not have a battery charging indicator. All of which are present just one level up in the Professional Care 1000.To me the lack of a quadrant timer is a big disappointment - I don\'t want to be watching a clock while brushing if I don\'t  have to. The gentle thrumming of the Professional Care 1000 every 30 seconds is a very nice pacer.The brushes in the Professional Care series not only add quadrant timers, but also are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second, and have battery charge indicators.As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.Overall, I found the Vitality to be lacking features that I rely on. Hence my rating. I\'d strongly recommend that you consider the Professional Care 1000 as the minimum entry level functionality for a brush. You\'ll probably find (like I did) that you don\'t need much more than what the Professional Care 1000 has to offer.Happy Brushing!~Damodar"

A good sonic toothbrush can go a long way to keeping teeth white, clean and can reduce the number of trips to the dentist, but I don\'t think this one is the answer."

I know most people don\'t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn\'t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!Ok now for the research details:1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it\'s time to brush on another side.6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you9. It\'s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn\'t like to brush or doesn\'t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. It guides you so you know you are getting a great cleaning. Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it! So as you can tell I love it and I am very satisfied with my purchase! Good luck and hope it works amazing for you as it does for me and my family!"

The size is a bit larger than the regular model, but still remains sufficiently maneuverable. The hardest area to hit is behind the front teeth. It can be done, but there\'s more of a mess than with the smaller brushes.My only complaint is that they are a bit rougher on the gum line than the Ultrasoft Oral-B model.

Fortunately, this model has a built-in timer, which notifies you that it\'s time to stop or you\'ll overdo it. That is a very nice feature. The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth. After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning. The brush is also smaller and requires you to use less toothpaste, which will result in savings over time. The only downside is that the brushes are a little on the pricey side, but I\'m hoping they last longer than my regular brush.If you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush. Not only does it do a great job at cleaning teeth, I\'m sure this will result in less cavities when I get my dental check-ups."

In my honest opinion, the sensitive toothbrushes are generally a better way to clean your teeth. The medium to stiff bristles seem too large in diameter and stiff. These type of bristles are great for scrubbing stubborn particles, but not really that great for everyday cleaning of teeth especially when you use toothpaste that has fine abrasive particles.

Buzzing about in my mouth and definately making the gum area very clear and stimulated. A real massaging of the gums - which I know from my dentist that this is a good thing. Healthy for the gums.It was really amazing. It felt incredibly clean and especially clear of foreign materials. I am a flosser by nature as well..and I noticed after several days of usage...that my flossing showed less and less particles between my teeth. And those particles came out easier - even popcorn!What\'s really nice is it comes with and extra brush - either for use with two peeople or use one as your back up and it plugs into the wall nicely. There is no battery replacement however because it is magnetically charged the hand unit does not plug intothe wall. Free from cord or plug issues being close to water.It was packed well and comes complete with operational instructions as well as infomation on how to brush properly with it.

I thought it was okay, until I tried this one. This is a fabulous brush.Pros:1. Rechargeable battery. Not likely to lose juice any time soon-just make sure you charge it for 12 hours before use.2. Small handle. It\'s not much bigger around than a regular toothbrush, especially when compared to the monster I\'ve been using. The charger is compact, too, and doesn\'t take up much room on my counter.3. Compact head. Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.4. Soft bristles.5. Vibrates rather than spinning. The spinning kind really chewed up my gums. This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations. Went away as soon as the brush was off.6. Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth. I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore. I don\'t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.7. Stops briefly to let you know when it\'s time to switch \'quadrants.\' (You\'re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.) When the maximum 2 minutes has elapsed, the brush gives a double signal.8. There is a precision attachment to get between teeth and into dental work.9. Does a fantastic job.

We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist\'s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn\'t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn\'t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don\'t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn\'t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth."

526,537,20100105,B0002KHU3I,4,"January 5, 2010",A1P948LMDI28W4,Great product though not perfect,"Being an engineer, I did extensive research before buying an \'automatic\' toothbrush, and wound up selecting the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  The Oral-B has one huge benefit over the SoniCare I was considering and that was the rotary action since the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750 also has \'sonic\' pulsations.  A lower-end Oral-B had the dual-action brushes, but wasn\'t \'sonic\'.  Did a bit more research on the Oral-B website and found this dual-action brush head to be compatible with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  This was just another huge advantage of the Oral-B over the SoniCare automatic toothbrush.  Since these dual-action toothbrushes weren\'t too expensive, I took a gamble and brought three 3-packs.  This was about 4-months ago, and I\'m still using the first one from my purchase.I definitely felt a cleaner difference from the dual-action brush head than the rotating brush head that came with my Oral-B.  The lateral vibrating brush not only help loosen gunk from your teeth, it also provides the surface area for the toothpaste, and an additional \'sonic\' surface.  With just the rotating brush head, I generally cannot finish brushing within the two-minute recommended brushing time and take at least 4 minutes.  With the dual-action brush head, I\'m able to do it in 2-minutes and my mouth feels much cleaner.  And my teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter.  I had cavity filings that were colored to match my yellowish teeth, and now I can clearly see that my teeth are a much whiter shade than my filings.  (This was without change in toothpaste, and actually reduced time in brushing).So what can be improved?  Three things.  One is the dual-action brush head is a bit thick, although not much thicker than the regular rotary brush heads.  Would be nice to have a flatter profile.  Second is that flossing action bristles should come on the rotary part of the dual-action brush head (like that on the rotary brush that came with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750).  And third, and the most important, is that the rotary part and the lateral vibrating parts of the dual-action brush head should be angled about 10 degrees to contour fit the curve of one\'s teeth.  This will optimize the contact surface at any time we\'re gliding the brush during brushing.  With these improvements, I would give it 5-stars... food-for-thought for any Oral-B employees reading this."

I like that it\'s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison.  On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare.  And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general. (I also have their Pulsonic razor)  I also like the design of the charging unit and extra cleaning attachment as well.But as I said earlier, I switched from Sonicare to an Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.  And for me, comparing this Pulsonic to the Triumph... well, there\'s just no comparison.  The Triumph is better by far.  Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you\'re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.I\'ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it\'s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won\'t last long.  I can bring my Triumph on a 10 day vacation without the charging unit (and I brush twice a day.)  I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn\'t have a big enough battery to do that.  And even if it does, that just goes to show you the cleaning power.

The order came from TeethNthings.  The product was packed ok but I received it banged up.  The postal worker wanted to blame it on poor packaging but it was packaged fine.  The product itself was fine.I have been using this product for a couple of days now so I must report that I am overall very happy and satisfied with it.  I read over the instructions twice, and when I used it for the first time, I was puzzled when I felt it doing small pauses.  The instructions are ok.  They could have broken it down dummy-style for some of us but oh well.  I was a bit confused about how to set the timing part, but I figured it out.  It could have been the excitement.If you buy this product, it will do these short pulses every two minutes.  After two minutes of brushing, the smiley comes up and winks.  So cute.  If you reach 4 minutes of brushing, it will do the pulse thing again.  There is a DVD that comes with it to explain their brushing technique of using the brush.  They break it down in 4 quadrants, 30 second intervals, two get in at least 2 minutes of brushing.The toothbrush itself is a tad bit noisier and heavier than my old ancient basic one, but let me tell you, boy does it go.  I feel like my teeth are getting a serious dental treatment, Spa Dente\'.  I don\'t know what this toothbrush will leave for the dentist to do, besides exrays.  To switch between the different brushing styles, you will push the triangle button while the brush is on.  The detached screen thing will tell you.  I use it in sensitive mode.  If you are brushing too hard, it will flash red.  Be careful not to push it while brushing, as it would seem easy to do.I really really love how they have the charger.  It is small and not bulky, which is perfect for travel.  Pretty smart how they did that.  The charger base is your travel base as well.  I really really love the blue travel case that it comes with so you can store two brush heads.  That is so neat.The best thing about this toothbrush is that it really gets your teeth, gums and mouth clean.  The smell of my breath has improved also.  It does a wonderful job.

At first I didn\'t like the size (read: I wasn\'t used to it), but after brushing with it for a weeks, I realize that I like it better because I can be more precise with my brushing (like with a regular toothbrush)The charger has a small footprint, so it doesn\'t take up too much counter space. It is  also understated so it doesn\'t draw attention to itself.Cons:The attachments (brush, floss brush) can come off or loosen during brushing. If you brush in a wrist-twisting motion like me, you\'ll have to change your brushing style or the tops will keep coming off.It only comes with one brush head. This means that unless you\'re a bachelor, you\'ll need to buy additional heads. I haven\'t looked up the price to these, but that\'s definitely something to consider.There is no cover for the brush heads. This can\'t be too sanitary - especially in a bathroom (dust, hairspray, hand-washing splashes, toilet mist, etc)Final opinion:While I do think this could be a good-value alternative to the costlier sonic toothbrush models, ultimately it\'s hard to say if this unit cleans much better than a manual toothbrush. I still end up brushing my teeth like I did with a regular toothbrush  - the only difference being that this one is vibrating as I go.With questionable benefits and so many shortcomings, I cannot recomend this product."

I couldn\'t believe the deal I got on here!  I saved about half compared to other stores in my area.  If you have sensitive teeth I would highly recommend this model.  Oral-B also makes the 1000 series model.  There\'s nothing wrong with this I am sure, however I believe it doesn\'t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  The only downfall is that about once a week you do have to charge the battery (which does take about 17 hours).  Honestly, that\'s not a big deal.  The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  It has room for additional brush heads.  It\'s a nice feature, but something I really don\'t find the need for.  Overall, those are minor things.  I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains."

I\'m also concerned that some of the power brushes are too powerful - my teeth get sensitive. After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I\'ve been doing pretty well with the cheap Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary). Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.It\'s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it\'s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn\'t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that\'s it. I think that when the battery dies it\'s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn\'t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don\'t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn\'t a concern for me. I\'m planning to buy this brush for my children to try. For an entry level power brush, this is a solid choice."

By way of full disclosure, I have been using the Oral B Cross-action toothbrush for a number of months, and in the past I used a Sonicare toothbrush.For whatever reason, I keep seeing more and more electric toothbrushes lately, each of which is supposed to be the \'latest and greatest\' design.  Frankly, I can\'t see the difference between many of them.  Maybe there are incremental changes that make them worth the sometimes excessive cost, but who knows?  And of course, manufacturers seem to be pretty generous with dental offices, which seem to either display the Oral B brand or Sonicare, or both.  But I suspect that the results between the various brands are pretty similar.This toothbrush is very similar to my Cross-action, the key differences being (i) it lacks the cross action brushes below the oscillating head, (ii) it has a 2 minute timer, and (iii) it\'s rechargable.  Frankly, I prefer the cross-action brushes, but that\'s not crically important.  I do really like the 2 minute timer, and the fact it\'s rechargable.  It does a good job cleaning, and the timer is a nice feature.From my perspective, I don\'t think that the brushes that sell for $70+ are worth the money.  Far from it.  The Cross action does a fine job on my teeth, and this brush is pretty comparable, with the added plusses of being rechargable and having the two minute timer.  So I think this is a good buy for the money, and I would recommend it.

Let me just start off by mentioning why I rated this product 4 instead of 5 stars. All of the different setting on the brush seem fairly pointless so I think it it would be easy to downgrade to another Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series Toothbrush without the \'massaging\' \'whitening\' or \'deep clean\' settings. So this isn\'t really a negative aspect of the product but something that the consumer is paying for and doesn\'t seem to be getting any extra benefit. Save yourself the extra cash and just get one of the more basic models; I only use the daily clean setting.Since using the Oral-B I do believe that my teeth gave become more white and have a greater overall brush experience. I think this has much to do with the included \'Pro-White\' head that is included along with the \'Floss Action\' head. The rubber cup on the head really wipes away plaque and buildup. I can\'t really say that the \'Floss Action\' head is all that the name seems to claim but it does seem to be a great everyday head to use when accompanied with daily flossing.Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Oral-B Professional Care Series to anyone looking to take great care of their teeth.

2360,2415,20101002,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 2, 2010",A277KHX8TFTC58,Fantastic,"I\'ve gotta say, this Oral-B Smart Series 5000 electric toothbrush is incredible.  I was skeptical because I have been using its direct competitor for about a year, the top-of-the-line Sonicare Flexcare HX6950 with UV Sanitizer, and was very happy with that brush.  A friend of mine has the Oral-B smart series, and when I saw it, I knew I had to give it a try to see what all the hype was about.  I found the opportunity when my father asked me to order him one, so I threw in an extra one for myself.  It arrived in two days from Amazon, brand spanking new.I\'ve used the Orab-B for about a week, 14 times, and I have to say its different than the Sonicare, not necessarily better, but just different, and just as good.  The Oral-B gives you a different kind of clean, and I definitely feel my teeth and gums get a really, really good cleaning after brushing.  My teeth also seem whiter now.  I think the Oral-B removes more plaque off my teeth, and more food from between my teeth due to the optional Floss Action brush head I\'ve been using.  Don\'t be fooled, there is no substitution for flossing, but this brush head does a little for you, especially if you have bigger natural gaps between your teeth, of which I don\'t, so I have to floss.  The Floss Action brush head is really amazing, quite an innovation, and I love it.The wireless SmartGuide is pretty clever too.  It automatically goes on when you turn your toothbrush on.  I can definitely say, that the SmartGuide helps you to brush longer and more thoroughly.  Its almost like a trainer when your brushing, rooting for you to finish 30 seconds on each setting.  I do one cycle for the top teeth, and one cycle for the bottom teeth.  The SmartGuide is very helpful to anyone, no matter your age.  The four different stages of this electric toothbrush are also very helpful, I use them all, and always will.The Oral-B Smart Series 5000 comes with one Floss Action brush head, and one Pro White brush head.  I also ordered a 4 pack of sensitive brush heads, but haven\'t used them yet.  In addition, after seeing how much I like the Floss Action brush head, I ordered more of those, a 3 pack actually.  If your wondering about the price, forget about it, its totally worth it, and will probably save you thousands of dollars worth of needless dental work due to cavities.  I can\'t recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush enough.  In fact, if you have the money, be generous and buy them for other people that can\'t afford one.  Everyone should be able to use one of these, they are that beneficial to oral hygiene.  I can\'t imagine using a regular toothbrush after using an electric one, especially an electric on of this quality.As usual, Amazon is amazing for price, shipping, product quality, and customer service, literally the best store on the planet.  I don\'t even understand how other stores can stay in business with Amazon in existence.  I stopped keeping track of how much money I\'ve spent here in the past 10 years..lol."

My dentist sold me a toothbrush with two of these heads for 25 dollars, and now I know why. The plastic paddles in this head\'s bristles are like a jackhammer on your teeth and gums. I have used this brush for a week, and have had gums bleeding and swelling (NEVER any problems before, and yes, I floss daily), teeth getting more sensitive and less clean feeling afterward (they can feel quite clean, but you have to brush twice the recommended time, which is detrimental to enamel and gums), and this head makes a huge mess!

2344,2398,20101012,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 12, 2010",A3DY68UHABCTC5,Perfect for children,"I upgrade the toothbrushes for the kids with this SmartSeries 5000 mainly for the wireless SmartGuide it comes with. As I could not find more details from other reviews (maybe I missed) based on how I plan to use it. I\'ll focus the review on that front. I thought the SmartGuide is very helpful as the kids can clearly see the progress and stay on the brushing until 2 min. is reached. I\'m glad to report that it works as planned perfectly. As an adult, it is easier to manage the discipline on how long you should brush your teeth. However, my kids constantly want to get off the process and it is painful to calm them down and persuade them to go further. With the SmartGuide clearly showing the progress and how far you are away from the \'smiling face\', it helps managing the expectation excellently.Now get the details on how the SmartGuide works for our use. Each 5000 comes with one SmartGuide, and you can use just one for more than one toothbrushes. However, the manual also provides you instructions on how to make each SmartBuide dedicate to individual toothbrush if it is what you desired. I bought two together, and found that both SmartGuide will respond to signal coming from each toothbrush as the way I received them. Since I don\'t want to put two SmartGuides in one bathroom, I don\'t need to reconfigure anything.The SmartGuide function is very simple. It automatically receive the signal from the 5000 toothbrush as you start brushing. If you stop in the middle, the time counting will pause then resume when you continue. If you wait longer, (not sure exact, maybe 30 sec or longer), it will reset itself. Everything is automatic, there is no manual button to start or stop time counting, therefore it can not be a timer for anything else besides 5000. For the extra SmartGuide that I do not plan to put in the same bathroom with the toothbrushes, I use it as a clock in the other bathroom; it looks nice though.I don\'t have much to say on other fronts. Overall, it is an excellent purchase for young children.Charlie"

Teeth become so much whiter as the brush action really gets your teeth extremely clean.  The wonderful thing about this is you can change the brush heads to whatever you like (flosser head, precision head, etc.).  The power is nice and strong which I love, other folks may not be so thrilled.  If you have sensitive teeth this brush is still good just do not use a toothpaste with SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) OR use a sensitive toothpaste like Sensodyne.  I have sensitive teeth and use these products together and my smile is becoming more stunning everyday.  My son loves the timer function on the brush as he no longer has to use the clock."

Why it took so long for me to buy an electric or battery powered toothbrush is beyond me. However, I\'m glad I finally woke-up and bought this \'Oral-B Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\', I\'ll never buy another manual toothbrush again.It\'s a Great Toothbrush. Buy it, you won\'t regret it.It comes as advertized with two AA batteries, just plug them in and you\'re ready to go. It has a neat 2 minute timer, which by the way is a long time when you actually start brushing. And that\'s a good thing.I got one tiny, insignificant gripe, it\'s hard to see the (+ -) battery polarity on the side of the toothbrush after removing the battery cap. When I installed the batteries the first time it wouldn\'t start, so I had to switch the batteries around, and now I have to remember the correct installation the next time I add new batteries. It\'s nothing to lose sleep over.Speaking of battery caps, removing the batter cap may be a slight problem for those people who suffer arthritis of the hand but it\'s do-able. You have to \'squeeze hard\' the two rubber spots on the sides, at the bottom of the toothbrush to release the battery cap. With that said, that too can be a good thing, because that means the battery compartment is airtight and waterproof.The ON/OFF switch is covered in some type of rubbery, waterproof membrane and is very responsive; quick on, quick off. The brush itself has a nice weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. Has the right amount of balance as well.The handle is made of two types of materials: rubber and a very smooth plastic, there\'s enough rubber on the handle so you don\'t have to worry about it slipping from your hands, even when wet. The package doesn\'t mention anything about what type of bristle comes with this toothbrush (i.e., soft or hard bristle), however, I felt NO irritation or discomfort what-so-ever.The overall length is 8-inches; brush head length is about 2.75-inches, width of the handle is about 1.5-inches X 1-inches.There are four different styles of toothbrush refill heads available for the \'Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\':1)Oral-B \'Precision\' Clean Brush Head (which comes with this toothbrush)2)Oral-B \'Pro White\' Replacement Brush Head3)Oral-B \'Dual Action\' Premium Power Toothbrush Head4)Oral B \'Floss Action\' Brush HeadI plan on stocking up on all 4 refills.

Ignore the \'floss\' part - that\'s just marketing hype and you better still use a real dental floss. Yes, the Floss Action heads are a bit bigger, but I think that suits me fine, and you\'ll probably be down with it too unless you\'ve got really small teeth.I think this is the question you should ask yourself: Do you usually prefer soft/medium bristle toothbrushes, or do you tend to seek out the firms? I\'m a firm guy, thus I prefer the Floss Action heads. The yellow rubber bits gives these heads a hardness that I love and I feel like it cleans my teeth better.

I wanted to switch to another type, and I did a little research. I found Oral-B \'Sensitive\' heads, and I found good reviews on this product. I am using this heads for a few weeks now.

When I was using \'Precision Clean,\' I used to still see some stuff coming out of the area between my teeth during cleaning with HydroFloss.

Needless to say, he\'s in love, too!The only complaint I have is with both of us brushing our teeth at the same time, our timers malfunction. This is really a very small concern, considering the brush \'pulses\' every 30 seconds, reminding you to switch sides."

We\'ve used Oral-B sonic for 5 years, and 5000 for 1 year.Cleanness (draw):- Both cleans well. However, they cannot remove 100% dirt from the teeth, given they use two different ways to clean. (5000 is left-right, and Sonic is up-down). It really depends on where the dirt is hiding. I would say Sonic does a better job to clean the front teeth, and 5000 does a better to job to clean the teeth in the back.Power (5000):- 5000 wins. However, it may take 1 week for your body to adjust to the strong power.Timer (5000):- 5000 comes with a timer, which is very nice.Brush head design (Sonic):- We found that the brush of 5000 wears out much faster than Sonic. I guess it has something to do with the strong power of 5000.- One thing I hate about 5000 is the brush head design. There is a hole below the brush head, which capture the toothpaste when brushing. You cannot remove it without removing the brush head. If you leave the tooth brush standing, the toothpaste inside will get out, and eventually accumulate at the bottom of the brush. This creates a round mark in our sink. To solve this problem, we need to remove the brush head and clean it completely. We didn\'t have this problem with Sonic.Battery power (Sonic)- We don\'t charge the brush until the power is completely drained. Normally, the battery of Sonic lasts about 7 days, while 5000 lasts about 3-4 days. However, it takes about 18 hours to charge Sonic, while it takes less than 12 hours to charge 5000Other uses (Sonic)- We like to use the brush head to clean the tongue. Sonic wins.Overall, we like the Sonic better."

I got this toothbrush because I\'ve always had an issue with brushing too hard and have gotten very minor gum recession because of it. It took me a little while to set up (it\'s pretty complicated for a toothbrush), but it was completely worth it. I don\'t think the battery life is too good, but I always charge it after I use it, so it\'s never a big deal. It makes my teeth feel really clean, and it\'s nice to know how long you\'ve been brushing and if you\'re brushing too hard.

However, compared to something like the more expensive Sonicare Elite, this doesn\'t come close to the cleaning ability.  So, in my opinion, why pay the extra money for a powered toothbrush when the old faithful standard toothbrush seems to do just fine?Pros- Rechargeable (ultimately this is the best feature)- Has good power and the battery seemed to last about 5 days with regular useCons- Does not leave me feeling any cleaner than a standard toothbrush (A Sonicare does)- Does not feel anymore gentle on my sensitive gums than a standard (A Sonicare does)- The head feels a bit akward in my mouth (it\'s not large, but as it rotates it feels more like its in the way)- Sound of the rotating head is a bit loud"

On my old Braun electric toothbrushes the head rotated and oscillated, on this toothbrush the head pulsates or vibrates.Is it any better? The shape of the toothbrush head seems better designed to fit the shape or your teeth, and it is larger than the old design, large enough to cover two teeth. But while the head is larger in surface area it is much slimmer in profile so it is much more comfortable to use, it feeling much smaller in the mouth. I also like the timer function, it has an overall two minute timer, but it gives a signal every 15 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth.I like this new toothbrush, it seems as efficient as the old style Braun but is much more comfortable to use, and it is a little quieter too. It is also much easier to clean their being no inner workings as on the old style heads, which I am sure must be much more hygienic too.As the toothbrush should run for a week on a single 14 hour charge it is not necessary to replace the toothbrush on the charger after every use, so the charger does not need to be in the bathroom. Using the toothbrush this way should prolong the the life of the rechargeable battery tooHowever, as yet their does not appear to be an Interspace toothbrush head (which I need to reach awkward spaces) available to fit the toothbrush, so at the moment I am using both the old, with the Interespace head, and the new. Hopefully Braun will produce an Interpsace head for this toothbrush."

Can\'t imagine why an original product from Oral standard will have such a head which is so tough to fit and pull out from its unit. It even broke into small pieces inside mouth while brushing (very dangerous!). Not recommended at all.
1512,1548,20090913,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 13, 2009",AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"At last, an alternative to Sonicare","Sonicare and Oral-B are the two largest manufacturers of high-end powered toothbrushes. They initially entered the market using very different technologies: ultrasonic vibration for Sonicare, rotary brushes for Oral-B.Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces. They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task. The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges. At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B\'s rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.Sonicare\'s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system. The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled. These brushes are sold under the FlexCare moniker.After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare. I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare\'s. I don\'t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied. This may actually be a good thing since you\'re supposed to only apply it gently.Oral-B includes a feature similar to what Sonicare calls the \'quad-pacer,\' essentially a timer that signals you when it\'s time to switch quadrants (every 30 seconds)Battery life is about a week.Included in the package: brush, charging stand, bonus interstitial brush... but no travel case.PROS----- a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets- very low price for this technology- easy to clean- small charging stand- small brush, great for little hands- quad pacer- setting for sensitive gumsCONS----- may be too small for some hands- charger is 110V only (you need a transformer, not just an adapter, to use it overseas)- no travel caseCONCLUSION----------Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes. At less than half the price of the cheapest FlexCare, the Pulsonic is worthy of your consideration. Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don\'t move the brush back and forth, don\'t push hard: just hold it in place and let it do its job. You will get the best results if you rinse with Listerine and floss before brushing."

I have owned each for about 8 months now and I have to say that each brush has its own pros/cons and this is her favorite.  The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior/interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes some adjustment on the part of the operator.  I found that my gums could handle the Sonicare, but my girlfriend gums are more sensitive and she uses this Oral-B exclusively.  The motion of the brush is much more softer and the replaceable brushes tend to fit right over each tooth.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  I like having the ability to brush my tongue which is much more difficult with this brush."

It was nothing to write home about and was very basic compared to what is available these days. Once the battery went dead, I just went back to a manual toothbrush. I decided after my dentist appointment that my wife and I went to a couple weeks ago and having to pay $70(times 2) out of pocket as my copay for a deep cleaning for each of us to remove build up under the gums that I would see what was available in a rechargeable. It was a toss up as my dentist recommended both Oral-B, but only carried SonicCare with a $15 rebate at the front counter for sale. While at the Dentist office, I did enter a drawing for their top of the line SonicCare FlexCare Plus with Sanitizer by donating some can food for a local food bank for Thanksgiving. I am the type of guy that if I brought 999 cans and had a 999 out a thousand chance would not win in a drawing. I went home....researched both brands....read tons of reviews and checked the pricing on Amazon. The Oral-B reviews were consistly higher and the price with the 50% rebate on this model made it a hands down easier decision. This professional care toothbrush normally $159.99 retail was on Amazon last Wednesday for $104.99. I purchased 2 sets. They arrived at my door yesterday, with the free shipping and no sales tax. I was impressed when I opened them as to all that was included. My mindset was ....wow....only $50 for all this per set after rebate. It comes with at nice durable blue travel case that houses the toothbrush, and 2 brush heads. A nice travel charger that is multi-voltage and will work in other countries such as UK or Australia. It even came with an extra set of duracell batteries for the remote control clock/timer. I thought that was a nice touch that they would include those. The rechargable toothbrushes were both battery dead, so I set one up in each bathroom, and let them charge overnight to full charge. I used mine first thing this morning and was pleasantly surprised as to how easy and proficient it was brushing...I mean.... 30000 brush stokes per minute is 500 per second and I know I was never doing that manually. It comes with two different styled toothbrushes...one round and one flossing type. The flossing type is my favorite as it actually is flossing while brushing, so it is a 2 in 1 brush. Your teeth will feel like you just had them professionally cleaned at the dentist office. That nice squeaky sound when you touch your teeth with your finger. The toothbrush has like 5 settings for brushing from Sensitive to Deep Clean. The default setting worked perfectly for my teeth and gums. The little handy remote control timer......sits to the side and not only gives you the time of day, but when you turn on the toothbrush it automatically starts a 2 minute timer or 3 minute depending on how you set it up and times you on a 2 minute timer to 30 seconds per quadrant and lets you know when to move to the next set of teeth in the next quadrant and gives you a smiley face when you are done.  Funny, as I was typing this review I got a phone call from my dentist telling me that I won the raffle for the $189.99 Sonic FlexCare+ with sanitizer and that I could come pick it up. While I have never won anything before I am more hyped up on the Oral B and will likely just sell the SonicCare FlexCare+ on Craigslist for more than I paid for both of my Oral B\'s together. I apologize if this was too wordy. I am not a professional writer and I base what I buy off of what others write and just did not want to miss anything."

I just started using it and it definitely has some extra power that my old one didn\'t have.  It is a bit loud, so if you have sensitive ears, be warned of that.  It charged fast and is holding its battery power well (I don\'t charge it every time I use it).  I brush for 3 minutes and use the 30 second timers for back, top/bottom, right/left, then the extra minute for my front top and bottom... I thought I would hate the 30 second timer and find it annoying, but turns out its really handy to brush each of the areas long enough.  I haven\'t used the little clock thing as I tend to walk around as I brush, but I imagine it would be good for those adjusting to electric toothbrushes and/or kids.  I also probably won\'t use the extra brush holder as my medicine cabinet doesn\'t have the room.  The travel case will definitely come in handy and the small charger is a nice change from my old clunky one.Pros:*Great clean*30 second pauses and 2 minute longer pause*Small charger*Travel case*Should help your dentist visits!!*Pressure notification (if you are brushing too hard, it gives some warning, but I haven\'t experienced it)*Separate timer would be good for kids or those new to electronic brushesCons:*Louder than my old model*Extra stuff... not sure many people need the brush holder, only some will use the separate timer*New heads are expensive"

The winner for me is Oral B Essentials. Very smooth - perfectly thin. Gets between the teeth with no trouble at all. Quick to do the whole mouth. Never cuts my gums. The floss can shred a little bit, but no worse than any other I\'ve tried, I won\'t bother deducting points for that.

But lately, I\'ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \'bristles\' and how they\'d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I\'d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I\'ll be certain to purchase this model again.  Goodbye, Reach!"

My old one was getting long in the tooth(sorry about pun!) and running real slow, so I investigated buying a new one.  Since they were on a 50% rebate sale, i just bought the top of the line 5000 unit.  I could not be more pleased with how clean my teeth end up - I have never had a brush that cleans as well as this one; my hygienist will be so pleased!I would like to expound on the advantages of this unit over the 4000 or 3000 in cleaning ability, but I have no idea, not having used the others.  If the only difference is gimmicks, then this unit is certainly full of them, and you might be just as pleased with a cheaper unit without the unnecessary gimmicks and modes.One big con: there is a mode button to toggle through the 5 different modes that are built into this unit.  Most people, like me, will probably only use one mode, or at least will predominately use one mode.  The mode button is VERY poorly placed, in a very key position.  It is impossible to use this unit without accidentally hitting the mode key on a regular basis, if not every day.  Very annoying to have to figure out how to get back to your preferred mode.  They could not have chosen a poorer location for this if that was the goal.  Its like accidentally hitting the caps lock key on a laptop, for those who do not look at the screen while we type. What were they thinking, if they were thinking at all?  I like good design.  All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an \'F\' for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO. It was just too big a mistake to be an oversight. A smaller con - the outlet plug is a huge unit that sticks straight out from the wall - takes up space and looks stupid - should have been flush.Yet overall, I gave this 4 stars for the great cleaning and the rest of the design and charger."

Most dentists put the Oral B\'s at the top of the list, and I\'ve been very pleased with them, but this new one is a leap forward.All because of a simple improvement: it not only divides the mouth into quadrants and gives a little shake to prompt me to move from one quadrant to another, but it has a separate wireless display.  When the brush isn\'t in use, the display serves as a darned good digital clock, and when brushing, it converts into a timer and a map of the four quadrants, depicting which quadrants have been brushed.  Then, once the two minutes have passed, the round quadrant display turns into a smiling face, which grins if you\'ve really been brushing enough.And it\'s the darndest thing, but breaking it up into 4 quadrants not only shortens the perceived brushing time dramatically, but I for one--yes, it\'s embarrassing but true--actually want to \'please\' the display, and get that silly smiley face.  Worse than that, I want to get the big grin on the smiley face!No, I\'m not lonely, I have a lovely girlfriend who brushes right beside me, but we both find that these Oral B\'s turn the longest 2 minutes of the day into an all too short game that seems to last at most 30 seconds.  And the cavity-free dental exams are nice, too.The only negative point: as is the case with all previous Oral B electric toothbrushes I\'ve owned, after even a single brushing it seems to take impossibly long to completely recharge.  I don\'t have any other rechargeable appliance that comes close.  It\'s not much of a problem, but it does seem peculiar."

Thankfully Amazon has awesome customer service and I was sent a replacement in one day.  The next one that came worked for one day until it wouldn\'t hold a charge long enough to even get through a brushing.  I upgraded from a Oral B brush that took 10 years to kill the battery.  I am going to stick to the cheaper spin toothbrushs because it is disappointing to get two duds.

When you brush you keep the mouth semi-closed and the brush in contact with your teeth at the border with your gums, without pushing too much. This smaller brush allows you to get all around the molars as well. She did not specify the brand but she did say that it is not a matter of price, it is all about how you use it. So you don\'t really need an expensive one. I bought this one because it gets great reviews and the price is very good. I love it! My gums are way better now and she very impressed (well...and I am very impressed as well!). When I went on vacation I brought the regular toothbrush and after a couple of days my gums were all inflamed again. I can\'t leave without it! The only thing I would change is the design of the base. I have a tiny bathroom and I would love to be able to hang it somehow to the wall so that it is not sitting on the sink.

They came with a travel case that stored one handle and two brush heads so it was convnient to travel with.  Then they started only going about 7 days on a charge so we bought this new version.The new version is a type 3756. It is white with with a royal blue front and a white on/off button.  It only will go thru 4 brushings before needing recharging.  It\'s slightly longer than the original so it won\'t fit in the old travel case and the motor is MUCH less powerful.  I called Braun to see if they were defective and basically was told this is how they work.  I\'ve gone back to using the old ones.  These were a total waste of money."

It\'s also relatively portable, so good for travel too, though you\'ll need to bring the charger along for longer trips.The Pulsonic is not as gentle on your teeth and gums as most of the more expensive toothbrushes I\'ve owned, but I haven\'t had any problems with it. It just feels like the motor does not run quite as fast or as smoothly and I think that probably makes it a little less effective at getting your teeth completely clean. It is certainly a lot better than my old manual toothbrush though! Overall I think it works very well.I bought it about a month after my previous (2-3X the price) electric brush broke, so I\'d been using a manual brush for a bit. After a week of using the Pulsonic my teeth were noticeably whiter and have gotten whiter since then. I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past- my soda drinking youth eventually caught up with me I guess:(. I\'ve had this brush for a year and my dentist says my teeth and gums are in great shape.My only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn\'t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right? If you\'re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don\'t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic."

My teeth are really close together so I have trouble using a lot of other types of floss and there is no way I could ever use the rounded type or the unwaxed stuff.  The price here is similar to what you can find it on sale for at your local store but I always forget to buy it when I\'m out so this four pack is convenient.  My only caution is to make sure you\'re buying the right kind - there is \'satin floss\' and \'satin tape\'... the packages look almost identical but I do not like the \'satin tape\' at all.  That is one mistake you can easily make at the store that you can avoid here!

This particular brush head is the best I have ever used for getting my teeth and gums really clean. It does take some getting used to.

But, according to my hygienist, I am a plaque producing maniac so it was suggested to me by her that I get one of these things.  The initial price shocked me but with the rebate, I could swallow spending a net of $50 on a toothbrush.  So far, I like it.  Not sure why anyone would \'need\' the little timer/clock thing that comes with it and I wouldn\'t suggest anyone spend extra money to have this feature. I have banished mine to a drawer as I do not have unlimited space in my bathroom. The toothbrush itself is a little bulky, but after a week or so, you get used to it. One of the features I do really love is the vibrate indicator.  After 30 seconds, it vibrates to tell you to move on to the next quadrant in your mouth.  What I am astounded by however (and kicking myself in the butt over) is the price of replacement heads.  I never thought to check on that before I bought this.  It costs about $25 for a 3 pack or about $12 for a single.  Also, I have yet to find a 3 pack that is a multi pack (i.e. different heads).  So, if you are like me, and use both the polishing and cleaning head, just using this toothbrush will cost about $9 every month to replace the heads.  As for how well it cleans...I am a smoker and a coffee drinker. I am also obsessed with clean teeth so I get mine cleaned by my hygienist every 3 months.  My teeth feel cleaner since using this toothbrush and if this toothbrush allows me to expand my dentist visits to every 6 months, the cost of the unit and replacement heads will be worth every penny (as I have to pay out of pocket for 2 cleanings a year b/c insurance only covers a cleaning every 6 months)If not, then I will be happy feeling as though I have cleaner teeth but will check this purchase off as a luxury and a \'want\', not a need. One other thing that I would like to point out is that, if, like me, you have limited bathroom space and outlets, this toothbrush is wonderful b/c you only have to charge it once a week. I was very concerned over where this unit was going to \'live\' as I need my bathroom plugs for my hairdryer and flat iron.  I do not leave the base sitting out and I do not constantly charge it. I keep the toothbrush in a drawer in the case (which is very nice) it comes with and simply charge it overnight every sunday."

So, getting one here through Amazon for under a hundred is a great buy! Not only was 96.00 a great price, but mine also came with a 50% mail-in rebate offer, which was a nice surprise. So, after that I will have only paid 48 bucks! Awesome! My girlfriend also got the rebate with hers. I don\'t know how long the rebates will last, but even without the rebate, this is an excellent price, and well worth every penny!After reading all the reviews here, and talking to my dentist about it and hearing his recommendation, my girlfriend took the plunge and ordered one a couple weeks ago. As soon as she tried it, she fell in love with it. She told me how good it felt on her teeth, and how clean her mouth felt after using it, and how she really looked forward to brushing. I immediately ordered mine the same day.My first impressions on the build quality...After opening and unpacking mine, I was immediately impressed with the build quality of the unit. The brush handle is solid and seems very well constructed, and the head that holds the brushes seems strong. I fully expect this to last a long time, and hold up really well. It\'s also attractive to look at, and the batteries last a long time on a full charge.This model comes with a separate wireless display unit, that displays brushing information while you\'re using it, and functions as a clock when you\'re not brushing. It displays a timer that will countdown from 2:00 minutes, or count up depending on your preference. It also shows the quadrants of your teeth for a visual reminder to make sure you get all areas. It displays which brushing mode you\'re using, and will flash a warning if you press too hard.Is the display really necessary? Perhaps not... The brush unit will vibrate each 30 or 45 seconds to remind you to change to the next quadrant. And it will stutter when the time is up to let you know you\'ve completed the recommended time. But, it is nice to have those visual cues where you can see them easily, and it is nice to have a small bathroom clock handy. So, I really like the display unit a lot. I think it was a nice addition, and I think most people will appreciate it.My impressions on actually using the brush...I\'ve had mine only a week so far, but I love it completely! I honestly think this is one of the best investments in my health I\'ve ever made. I\'ve never taken care of my teeth like I should have, and I have several fillings to show for it. I\'ve always tried to brush at least twice a day, but they were always short, quick brushes, by hand, and not very thorough. And I never thought I would be excited about brushing, until now.Now, I love brushing. I look forward to it. I brush at least three times a day, and never less than two minutes each time. I love how long the battery lasts, so I can take it with me to work, or on trips. This brush really makes it easy to stay on top of brushing. I can feel how thoroughly each tooth is getting cleaned, and it feels good on my teeth and gums. I haven\'t experienced any discomfort using mine.After brushing, my teeth are literally squeeky clean. It really does feel like a professional cleaning. It\'s only been a week with mine, but I can already notice a difference in their appearance. I\'m excited to see how they will look after a couple months.One last thing I really like is the carrying case that comes with it. It holds the brush firmly in place, and two brush heads firmly in place. Very convenient for carrying with me.This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I can\'t even imagine going back to a manual brush. I highly recommend this, and I\'m sure you will enjoy it just as much.Hope that helps..."

It\'s slim and easy to hold and the brush head is the right size, fits in my mouth nicely, and I like the way it cleans.  I also like the little Precision brush that comes with it.  It does a nice job along the gumline. The noise isn\'t bad either.

She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself.

The strictly bristle models tend to wear out quicker and they pretty much all floss and brush the same.  The \'polishing heads\' are much different as they have silicone or rubber center which really does polish the teeth while removing plaque and flossing as well. This center also extends the life of the bristles by protecting the pressure/ breaking down during agressive brushing.  I smoke cigars, and after 2 weeks, the plaque is gone.  Feels like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist...squeek and all.These tend to be the most expensive heads available, but with better results and the much longer life, these are a no-brainer.

You know, when he gets the polisher out and rubs your teeth with it.  That is pretty much the same sensation you get with this brush.  I had to learn to not hold it against my teeth so hard because it was vibrating my entire head.I have to caveat.  I also own a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  To be honest, I think that the Sonicare feels better on my gums and also I think it does a better job overall.  HOWEVER, I hate my sonicare because of the way it grows mold.  The new sonicare models get your nasty toothpaste-spit mixture inside of the brush head where you can\'t see it growing mold.  Unless you actually unscrew the head and wash it out every day, and leave it taken apart to dry out, you will get mold inside your sonicare - and once that happens the brush pretty much smells like mold for the duration of its life (there may even be mold inside of the handle itself which I just cannot see without breaking it).This is not the case for the Oral-b Vitality.  The vitality features a snap-on type head which has no cracks to allow water to seep through.  The new sonicare features a flexible head, which I believe creates the problem with the mold (the old sonicares did not flex nor did they have the same mold problem).  The Viatlity head does not flex, it\'s just a straight snap-on piece with a rotating brush head at the top.Another thing I like about the Vitality is that it has changeable heads.  There are different heads which you can attach for different uses: Floss-Action, Pro White, and Dual Clean heads.  I use the Floss-Action and Pro White attachments - 2 minutes for each attachment.  The Floss action feels somewhat similar to a normal brush and gets all the stuff off your teeth, but the Pro-White has a weird yellow rubber thing in the middle of the bristles which rubs up against your teeth and whitens/polishes them.The Vitality also beats the sonicare in that it\'s brush heads come in packs of 3 for $20, whereas the sonicare offers packs of 2 for $20 (however, I believe the sonicare claims it lasts for 6 months and the vitality for 3).BATTERIES - the sonicare lasted about a month on a single charge - the Vitality only lasts about 2 weeks.That is all I can think of to put in this review.  The only reason I gave this brush 4 stars instead of five is because I wish it had more of a Sonicare vibration action - however it has an interesting rotating action which takes some getting used to.  The Vitality just doesn\'t feel like it cleans the gumline as well as the sonicare did - but at the same time it feels like it cleans the surface of the teeth better than the sonicare."

Once it goes in your mouth the floss breaks the moment it touches any teeth.  I\'m not sure how Oral B can put their name to this piece of junk. The worst part, the floss often tares apart in shreds (when it doesn\'t break entirely), leaving threads of this stuff stuck in between your teeth.  So, you have to use ANOTHER one to get the first one out. Often times you end up shredding that one in the same spot and need to try again using just enough pressure to make it between the teeth, but not too much that it leaves another thread stuck there.

I considered switching to a sonic type system but was dismayed at the variety of brush heads that are not interchangeable among the leading brand\'s models. Oral-B brushes are backward and forward compatible between models which means all the spare heads I had on hand work perfectly well with the new 5000. Anyway, it works very well in all modes and I like the ability to keep four different type brushes on the stand. The visual cues, timers and cleaning modes are very handy. The only drawback to this unit is the grotesquely large charger plug which measures 3.5\' long (excluding the prongs!). Seriously? What designer/engineer thought that was a good idea? There must be a way to achieve a charge without a such a titanic plug, like building the charging guts into the stand for example.

After a few weeks of exclusively using this toothbrush there was no noticeable whiteness difference for my teeth. It was easy to use and there were no issues with it. I chose to return to the Sonic and will keep this one as a back up. The reason for this was due to the brush head since I had already picked up a replacement pack.

426,434,20120414,B0002KHTG6,2,"April 14, 2012",A34E2DIWNBEJ19,"Too big, too hard",This is a nice idea for a brush but poorly executed. The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision. The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure. Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums. I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.
2858,2934,20100826,B003UKM90Q,4,"August 26, 2010",ALXFN5BF1H691,Not bad for a cheap rotating brush,"I\'ve used one of Oral-B\'s more upscale models for a while (the 8900 DLX), so I was curious how the value models would do. And it\'s really not too bad for $30.First, you have to realize that if you\'re moving from a normal brush you have to re-learn how to brush. No more moving the brush rapidly with your hand - press the button on the handle and it starts whirling at high speed. Press the brush to your teeth and gums and sloooowly move it left to right or right to left. Make sure you get all three sides of top and bottom, and that you get the gumlines - that\'s the most important part. Obviously it doesn\'t really matter what order you do it in, but if I don\'t keep a pattern I get distracted by pets or people and forget. After two minutes the brush will briefly stop the motor a few times to let you know you\'ve brushed enough - next time you can adjust your movement speed to hit that mark.It includes an induction charger - just set the handle on it. You can do it every night or once a week.So how does this $30 model compare to the $90-120 models? Well, the grip is noticably cheaper, with no rubber grip stripes. The induction charger is very easy to tip over compared to the sturdier \'well\' model. There\'s no charge indicator. The whole thing feels a little bit more flimsy than the 8900, though it never felt like it would actually come apart. There\'s no 30 second indicator like the better models, and there\'s only one speed, though I never found the other speeds on the 8900 useful anyhow.All in all not bad for $30 - of course they\'ll get you for $3-4 each for replacement head, but that\'s only every 3 months or so, and this comes with one head and one spare head. And I think you\'ll do a better job with this than with a regular brush - it\'s very easy to pay for itself if you just get one fewer cavity. If you want one of the above features spring for a better model, but this isn\'t bad for 1/3rd the cost."

It\'s twice-daily battle, with everyone ending up disgruntled in the end. While this toothbrush won\'t necessarily change the aggravation factor for kids, it WILL make sure that the visit to the dentist doesn\'t up YOUR disgruntlement.We got this toothbrush for our 9-year-old, who not only hates to brush his teeth, but has more than his fair share of issues with said teeth. Put simply, his orthodontist bills will be horrendous. And while he still hates to brush his teeth, I can feel confident that the dental bills won\'t outstrip the orthodontist. The two-minute timer is especially helpful for everyone, as Son knows when he\'s done and I can listen for the toothbrush to signal rather than digging up yet another destroyed kitchen timer. The action on the toothbrush head is much better than what he can do himself, though I have no idea whether it actually removes any staining (he\'s a little young for coffee and red wine issues).The price is very reasonable (particularly considering the cost of some other rechargeable toothbrushes) and the cost for the head replacements is not bad either. It\'s basically a very solid electric toothbrush that just might help shave a little aggravation and/or frustration out of your day!"

Then I tried this DualAction brush head, and loved it even more in about 3 seconds.  Still do.  In fact, I recently ordered 5 of the 3-packs all at once because I\'ve had trouble finding them in stores and I was afraid they would stop making them or change the design.Now, it is true that at first it feels like you\'ve put one of those power floor scrubbers in your mouth, in that it feels kinda big and industrial until you\'re used to it.  But boy does it make your teeth and gums feel cleaner.  And I was accustomed to the different feel by the end of my first brushing with it.  If that sounds potentially troubling to you, I recommend just buying a one-pack the first time.  It\'s not cheap, after all, but for me it\'s been well worth the cost.  Do try it.I should also note that when I mentioned to my dentist that I\'ve been using this, she referred to it as a \'business killer.\'  I take that as another good sign."

It produces a STRONG vibration...VERY strong.  Not for the young child or the sensitive mouth.  I seriously felt like I\'d put a power drill into my mouth!That being said, I\'d have to say it is worth the uncomfortable feeling (which I\'m starting to get used to) -- even after just the first use, my teeth looked shiny and polished, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  And despite the strong vibration, I didn\'t have any issues with my gums bleeding.  I think it just takes some getting used to, especially if, like me, you\'re not used to using a power toothbrush.So I would say that the only downside is that you can\'t control the level of vibration -- it\'s either on or off.  Sometimes it would be nice to turn it down a bit (especially in the morning...though I guess it\'s an effective way to wake up!).  ;-)  Adjustable power levels would make this a 5-star product.  It would also be nice if it had an indicator light that tells you when it\'s fully charged or charging."

The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  The brushing unit is waterproof so no worry about getting water or moisture on it. There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush. The unit uses a rechargeable battery, which the company claims can not be over charged, so you can store the brushing unit on the electric charger unit.I have used both a Phillips and Oral-B electric toothbrush and find that this rechargeable model does a comparable job in the cleaning of my teeth. I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back teeth.The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth. The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums. The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off. The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.The brushing bristles give an indication by fading in color to show when it should be replaced. I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package. Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long but it looks very similar to the brushing head I have used on my Oral-B electric toothbrush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model."

The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  The brush itself is cordless, although the cord on the base station would be better served if it were retractable, for space management purposes.  Oral-B claims that the rechargeable battery cannot be \'killed\' by repeated charging, so hopefully that works as advertised.  The package also comes with one replacement head, which is a value-added touch.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.Second, effectiveness.  It\'s equipped with a 2 minute timer, which indicates the suggested total brushing length.  This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner after usage, although not quite on par with visiting a dentist\'s office.  The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.The review merits the deduction of one star, due to head design.  If the head were skinnier and angled, then it could enable better access to teeth in the rear of my mouth. Overall, a very good, entry-level toothbrush from Oral-B."

2368,2423,20120128,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 28, 2012",A1PLOIFMHQ9M7C,Great toothbrush,"First off I\'m a dentist.I\'ve never recommended electronic toothbrushes in the past since their benefit over a regular toothbrush had not been scientifically proven in studies (the American Dental Assoc had called a tooth brush a fluoride applicator).  A crest representative came to my office, presented information that made sense and had literature that this brush was the only toothbrush to show increased efficacy in independent testing.  Anyway I bought several for my parents and myself and have been impressed.What I like:-Makes your teeth \'feel\' noticeably cleaner, like they feel when they\'ve just been cleaned at the dental office-Wireless display motivates me to brush longer than I normally would, I\'ll be honest I don\'t know where they got the recommended 2 minute timeframe, but I do it to see the smiley face on the indicator-Wireless display has PRESSURE INDICATOR; I diagnose wear on teeth at the gum line multiple times everyday.  If this is an issue for you get this brush.  It\'ll save you money at the dentist and stop you from harming your teeth-Well made, handle is thin and ergonomic, charger has a small footprint on the counter, no electrical components exposed and everything feels sturdy-Wide selection of brush heads that are reasonably priced ($40 for a 2 year supply at Costco).  Two heads stand out to me.  The first is the funky looking one, which actually provides a floss like action between teeth.  NOT a substitute for flossing but I have noticed considerably less debris removed when I do floss after using this brush.  Also there is an orthodontic (braces) brush that gets in-between the teeth and the braces.  If you are plunking down the thousands for your child to have braces get this brush / attachment, otherwise when the braces a removed there is a good chance the teeth will have unsightly white halos around where the brackets were which is actually decalcification which is the start of cavities.Overall I\'m very impressed with this brush so it is most defiantly \'dentist recommended\' by myself.  My parents absolutely love it."

1612,1654,20080827,B001CX4JSS,5,"August 27, 2008",A2X61KKXXR6WNP,A better toothbrush,"This product is Oral-B\'s answer to the Sonicare, as both of them clean teeth using ultrasonics (tiny vibrations) instead of a more standard rotating head.  Kind of like the old vibrating toothbrushes from long ago, except the power behind this is far greater, and much more effective.Sonicare had the benefit of being first with this type of brush, but Oral-B has an advantage in that they can study the other product and make improvements on it.  I\'d say the major difference is that the Oral-B is thinner, lighter, and therefore easier to hold and maneuver around the mouth.  The replacement brushes are also less expensive on this model, which is important as they can really add up if you replace them as recommended by the manufacturer, every three months or so.I was pleased to see that toothpaste can be used with it, although if you use too much you\'ll be foaming at the mouth from the ultrasonics.  It is still pretty foamy, so I recommend staying close to the sink.The recharging base is small, attractive, and wall-mountable.  The power cord plugs into a wall outlet and doesn\'t use a transformer, so it won\'t take up additional outlets. It will hold two spare brush heads behind the toothbrush, and allows the toothbrush to be dropped in facing any direction.  So, when you are done it is an easy matter to drop the toothbrush back onto its base.It actually worked quite a bit better than I expected.  The head is fairly small, so it is easy to move around your mouth to clean each tooth.  The timer lets you know if you are rushing the job (I usually am, but at least now I can\'t pretend I don\'t know that!).  The massage mode for the brush seems like a feature that I\'ll never use, but people with tender gums that are working their way up to the full speed might like it.  I use mine on clean mode all the time and it works well.  It is somewhat annoying that both modes are accessible through the single button given that I never use the lower-speed.  It isn\'t so annoying that it is a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.I was happy with the noise level, too.  Nothing bugs me more than holding something that sounds like a buzz saw so close to my ear in the morning.  Mercifully, this brush is pretty quiet, as these things go.  It is louder than a manual brush, of course, but quieter than an electric shaver.  The pitch is a little high, but nothing I can\'t live with.Overall, I like it and would get it again.

Both are somewhat expensive but certainly worth it because my only expense since using either one of the devices at the Dentist\'s office is for the annual pofessional  cleaning.  Healthy gums with no new cavities or bridgework that needs to be done make these kinds of devices well worth the money.

Initially it took some getting used to an electric/electronic toothbrush vs. a manual, but it really does a superb job.  My teeth feel like I\'ve been to a dentist for a cleaning after using it.  Has a handy timer/wall clock unit to tell you when you\'ve reached the two minute recommended brushing time, but I always exceed that since I like a good scrubbing on the choppers.No issues at all so far with the unit.  The real test will be when I return to my dentist (who had in fact recommended this unit) and see if the cleaning is shorter or if they notice any difference.I\'ll update after that happens.Overall, I\'m completely pleased and think that it\'s probably a good investment.  Also, and it may be my imagination, but I think my teeth are whiter now than they used to be.I would recommend this (and have) to my friends."

Wish I had read more reviews before buying two! This happened to me and my husband when he tried his...it is really easy to twist ever so slightly while brushing which pops head off. It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on. Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth. Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode. Returning two of these and will probably go back to Sonicare for next purchase."

What a disappointment!  Shoddy construction -- the brush part twists off so easily that it came off twice while I was using it, and it vibrates your hand more than in your mouth.  It also lacks a brush cover, something I was used to with the Sonicare.

Having tried multiple rotary style brushes and battery-operated pulse brushes, I was a bit wary on the switch to a Sonic/pulse brush since she was quite fond of her former brush.Summary (per the wife)- Size...perfect for smaller hands/mouths, but very useful for getting to those hard to reach areas. Better portability; however, because of the small diameter of the base, it doesn\'t stand upright that well (but too big to fit in any toothbrush holder slots)- Charging Base...takes up a very small footprint on sink- Price...much lower than many newer Oral-B/Sonic-care brushes- Performance...cleans extremely well, takes a week or so to get used to it.I did try it out for a day or so, too (don\'t tell the wifey!!!) and was quite pleased by the pulsing sensation and the way it made my teeth feel/look.

The first thing that I noticed is that the blue color is darker.  Then the coefficient of friction moving from one tooth to the next tooth is much higher.  Probably what happened is that the fake brush has cut bristles and the real thing has rounded bristles.  Finally, the most obvious tell is that you can easily scratch the logo off the counterfeit item with your fingernail but the real item has a completely glazed surface.I have been buying these Floss Action brushes for about 3 years (since they first came out) and I replace them every month, so I\'ve bought a lot of them.

The reviews and the rebate attracted me to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. I especially liked the polishing mode, since I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth. I didn\'t think that I\'d use the clock/timer/sensor, but I decided to put it up to have a small clock in my bathroom. I\'m using it all of the time! I give my teeth a \'spa treatment\' - floss, polish, massage gums...and feel like I\'ve had a professional cleaning. Having always been a diligent brusher, I was surprised to see that I could benefit from the reminder to brush each of the four areas for 30 seconds. The little warning light that tells me when I\'m exerting pressure (and thus brushing too hard - all you have to do is hold the brush up to the surface of the tooth and let it do the cleaning) is useful for breaking a bad habit that seems to crop up in the same place quite often.I even like the smiley face as a reward for good brushing, although I usually tend to be rather jaded about such things. I think that I\'ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. And I\'m also glad for the travel case since I hated to make trips without my Bruan (you just can\'t got back to manual brushing after you\'re brushed this well), but I\'d find that the \'on\' button sometimes got pressed in my luggage and used up the charge. The base for the Oral-B is also small enough to pack easily."

The Dual Action / Dual Clean is another matter. It started out working alright, although like many others I found the brush head to be a bit too large. One day while brushing, the brush severely pinched my tongue causing it to bleed. Upon close inspection, the lower oblong brush seemed loose with a substantial gap between it and the brush housing. I suspect that over time friction wears away at the internal parts leading to looseness.I was not happy about the experience and sent the defective brush to Procter & Gamble for evaluation. I was quite surprised when they replied that no manufacturing defect was present, despite being informed of the loose lower brush. They could provide no explanation as to how the injury occurred and would not provide any contact information for me to escalate the issue. If this is P&G\'s attitude towards product safety, I will avoid purchasing any of their products in the future."

So its intended circular motion no longer worked well.  So i though maybe it was just a bad one.  I got out the next one, and 2 weeks latter. Same thing happened.  So i compared it to a genuine one from walmart, and noticed some differences.  It was missing a serial number through the little window on the back, and the plastic piece up in the inside was different as well.

Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don\'t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don\'t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don\'t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.

I could never go back to a regular brush.However, I have a huge gripe with people who post products for a ridiculously cheap price only to essentially double the cost with shipping.  In this case, $16 for the heads and $11 to ship them.  I can\'t imagine from their weight, that they cost anymore than $2-$3 to ship, so how someone justifies the extra $9 is beyond me.Bottom line is that this is a fantastic product that I have been extremely happy with, but the seller\'s price is (in my opinion) misleading at best and probably could be more accurately described as downright dishonest."

Another feature I like is the pulsing every 30 seconds.  It is supposed to be for those who divide their brushing between 4 sections of the mouth, upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. Since I like to do the back side of my front teeth together, instead I took the first 30 second pulse as, \'Ok, you\'re halfway through the top,\' and the second as a cue to move to the bottom.It\'s amazing, how much I had to force myself to stay on the top a full minute.  I didn\'t even realize I was brushing the lower teeth more.  I recently had a cleaning where I was told my upper back teeth had more plaque than lower. Now I know why!This will keep you even in your brushing time throughout your mouth, feel great, give you a terrific clean, yet be gentle.I was SO pleased that I got one for my hubby.  We have separate bathrooms, or could have easily shared the handle.  He didn\'t do the full two minutes on our old version, but on this one he is.

I prefer the oral-b / braun non-sonic over the sonic models. I am a big fan of this style of toothbrush & have owned them for almost two decades. I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years) and this one is my favorite. The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \'brake light\' which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums. Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \'get all up in there\', but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful. I buy the \'extra sensitive\' heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I\'m not \'paying attention\'. Even though the other models had an \'indicator\' (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn\'t really enough to get my attention so I didn\'t reduce the pressure.When I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light - it\'s *really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall. (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom). But, the \'brake light\' was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and the light now only goes on every once in a while.They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing. This toothbrush with its \'brake light\' feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums & your teeth, and in turn, your health & well-being!PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, & healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon). I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)"

Quite frustrating.

It is a little confusing at first but it\'s not really difficult to use. I\'m not exactly a rocket scientist so if I can do it anyone can.  There are a number of things that you have to learn and get used to and decide what the most comfortable settings are for you.  I will get a couple of the recommended brushes, especially the \'floss\' brush.  They are fairly expensive but I think they last a long time.  The unit is a tad heavy in comparison to my old Oral B, but it didn\'t take long to get use to.  I think my teeth look brighter and feel cleaner than with any other brush I\'ve ever used.

They are brand name Oral B replacements. If you\'re thinking about being cheap and buying a knock off replacement please don\'t! Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the real thing. Your Oral B toothbrush was meant to be used with Oral B heads. The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand. As far as the advertised \'Pro White\', I cannot attest to that. I seem to highly doubt that just by using a different head that you\'re teeth are magically gonna become whiter.

The top part of the brush goes in circles and the lower part of the brush goes up and down and really gets in there-- and without irritating!The timer is great also! Sometimes I feel like I am rushing when I brush my teeth, but with the built in 2 minute timer, I know that I am not exactly rushing through and well, its doing a great job in those 2 minutes.I am not finding any left over food when I floss afterwards either which really shows that this toothbrush is doing its job.Also, since this is rechargeable, I dont have to worry about constantly changing the battery- so that saves time and money!!There is an extra toothbrush head that I decided to use one and my husband the other one.

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  This particular item is three heads.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads.

The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage. Obviously Oral-B is trying to cut corners here by offering a newer model with inferior quality.If you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine.

(You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about oral hygiene.)The toothbrush comes with a sealed plastic charger, which will charge the brush overnight.  A full charge will give you a week\'s worth of brushing. (14 x 2 minutes) This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.

Amazon should be at least somewhere responsible for the quality of their products and even of the resellers.  Refunding or contacting the reseller is the least they can do in my opinion.  The manager has forwarded my story to the inventory department and if I receive a call back I will update here.  Thanks everyone.Update: I haven\'t heard yet from Amazon, but I called Oral B.  They took this much more seriously.  At Amazon I got the feeling they thought I was scamming them, but Oral B took all my information, refunded me, and is looking into it.  Like I said I didn\'t really care about the money, but rather that I\'ve been using fake brushheads for a year and the fact that it still seems like Amazon is selling them.  Who knows if I was damaging my teeth...."

In the early 80s I had gum surgery because of it. I\'m supposed to go to the dentist every four months for a cleaning, but of course I don\'t go to the dentist near that often; maybe once a year if I\'m lucky. Anyway I always have a large plaque buildup when I finally do go to the dentist for a cleaning. The last several times I\'ve gone to the University of Pittsburgh school of dentistry where dental hygiene students do the work and the instructors check their work and correct the cleaning if necessary. Anyway I\'ve never had better cleanings in my life, but I still get severe plaque between cleanings. The last time I went the instructor recommended the Oral B 5000 toothbrush for my plaque problem. I thought I\'d give it a try and to say I\'m pleased is an understatement. I\'ve been using it now for five weeks after my last cleaning and as of yet I can feel no plaque buildup on my teeth. In the past by this time after a cleaning the plaque was starting to form when I used a regular toothbrush. I use the included timer and clean my teeth for a total of about 2 1/2 minutes. The feature I like is that you can get the molars clean. This was always a problem area for me in the past. Also the toothbrush will slowdown or stop if you press too hard. After a week or so you know what kind of pressure to apply and hone your cleaning technique. I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has a plaque or gum problem. One final note; I don\'t keep the charger plugged in all the time. I charge the toothbrush and can use it for eight or nine days before recharging. I\'m old school on this and feel the battery will last much longer if not charging all the time. I might be wrong on this, but I know at the very least it won\'t hurt battery life."

I don\'t think the return policy allows me to return it after so many months. The price was too low to be true, just $11.65 a pack. And it wasn\'t. Obviously it is fake. My first brush broke up in just 4 or 5 uses. A pin in the back that supports the brush head fell off. The second one can\'t even fit my Oral-B Vitality well. The vibration kicks it off in 5 seconds! I have to use my fingers to keep it stay in position. If I spent half the price to get a fake one, I would expect it lasts at least half as long as the real product. This one lasted only a couple of days.

I find myself wrapping my thumb around the handle to hold it while brushing and, sometimes inadvertently, hitting the Mode button. So, I\'ll be brushing in one mode and then the brush will switch to a different mode -- this makes me have to hit the Mode button 3-4 times to cycle back through to the mode I want to use. Again, this is my fault, but I also blame it on the design of the brush.2) I find the brush head bristles to be way too hard/harsh. I have these brush heads: Floss Action, Precision Clean and Pro White. I am going to buy the so-called Sensitive brush head and give it a try. If you have sensitive teeth/gums, like I do, then you may want to reconsider buying this brush or make sure you buy the Sensitive brush heads from the start.Other than these two \'flaws\', this is an awesome brush!"

After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can\'t see because it\'s inside the column. It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next day.The directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable. I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000% markup.I tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.Caveat emptor."

Unfortunately, even on the sensitive setting, it hurt on impact, and I\'m not talking a little, I mean alot.  Thinking I was jumping the gun, I lightened up on it and went around the entire mouth.

The Oral-B Pulsonic was my first venture into the higher end toothbrushes and I must say it is very nice.  Let me first say I am not big on reading directions on most products before I try them out.  So, after a few days of brushing, I went to the directions to see why my new toothbrush kept pausing or hesitating after a couple minutes of brushing.  Low and behold, it\'s a feature designed to let you know it\'s time to move on to another part of your mouth...very nice.The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.  The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  I have found the button placement may not be located at the best spot for some people.  While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  The brush is thinner than other brushes I have used.  I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  Also, the brush head is much smaller with fewer frills than other sonic brushes I have tried.Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.  I cannot say if this toothbrush out pulses the competition or does a better job of cleaning, but compared to the previous brushes I have tried this one is twice the price.

Recommended by my oral hygenist, it really cleans my teeth - makes them feel velvety smooth... just like when my hygenist finishes cleaning my teeth. I can\'t get that with any other electric or non-electric toothbrush. The better a product is, the harder I evaluate it and the more nit-picky I become, so here go the suggested improvements: First, the recommended cleaning time is 2 minutes which I believe is way too short. I double that by brushing the lower and upper jaw, each using the times for my entire mouth. Last, the controls are too easy to accidentally hit. This causes the toothbrush to go into another cleaning mode when you didn\'t want it to. I don\'t know how you can fix this except to be careful when holding the toothbrush and not accidentally hit one of the two buttons on the handle. I imagine if they located the controls elsewhere, or made them more difficult to press, I would be complaining about the ergonomics! Maybe a lockout on the end of the brush would help? Excellent toothbrush, charge lasts a long time, slim, light, fairly quiet, brush heads (choice of 4 different heads; comes with two: deep clean and polish) designed to clean deep and in between the teeth.

Yes, it has two settings but, it shouldn\'t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn\'t have to with their older model. The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting. There is also no indication that it is fully charged except by plugging it in when uncharged and timing it.  The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  I\'m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  I am now \'cost sensitive\' as I am only willing to spend so much to \'rent\' a unit for a couple of years (my older one lasted on the lower side of this equation) only to have to throw it and the useless, spare, brand new brushes I have away (it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit\'s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.On the plus side, it is very slim so it fits nicely in the hand and, I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once so, I suppose that jackhammer feeling of the brush obviously did not do any harm to the enamel as I had feared it would."

Most of them work pretty well. This one however, works wonders! If you\'re thinking that the timer/sensor is gimmicky... you\'re wrong. It comes with an adhesive backer so you can stick it to your mirror (or wherever you brush your chompers). I used be the person who brushed for maybe 30 seconds. But with the timer, you can\'t help but feel like crap for quitting early. It tells you how long you\'ve been brushing, the battery level, if you\'re brushing too hard, which zone you should be brushing, and what mode you\'re in. AWESOME! The battery lasts for about a week, but if you\'re on a longer trip you can take the charge out of the base (it\'s tiny) and pack it with you. There are tons of different brush heads and different brush modes, depending on what you\'re trying to accomplish. I got this toothbrush last September and have had two dentist cleanings since then. Both times they have remarked that I\'m doing an excellent job brushing, have no signs of cavities, and have the healthiest gums they\'ve ever seen. Love this toothbrush.Recommended: Definitely"

Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week\'s time, in my case of twice daily use. While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful! Not only is this toothbrush built for home use, it\'s the one you won\'t want to be without wherever you go.I especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I\'m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds. The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who\'ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have... yet I found I can get used to the sonic sensations, and I even feel that my gums and teeth are gaining strength, cleanliness and overall health. Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.So just how compact is this toothbrush? At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one\'s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing. The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth. The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.The directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I\'ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do). Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question. This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush I don\'t want to live without!

It doesn\'t last as long between charges (approximately 1/2 as long, 5 days instead of 10 days), and you\'ll need to be careful about letting it discharge once in a while because of the memory effect of NiCd batteries.It also lacks a lot of the frills of the other toothbrush. No LED light to indicating charging / charge full, and it does not pulse at 30 second intervals when brushing. It does pulse at the end of 2 minutes though.The brushing action is also different from the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush. The brushing action feels weaker, though I must admit the teeth feels just as clean afterwards. I tried the same toothbrush head on them - they appear to be interchangeable. I\'ve also tried the original toothbrush head. I can\'t judge effectiveness (they appear to all clean well) but the one that came with the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush feels more comfortable to me - better contact with the teeth.This toothbrush is significantly lighter, but otherwise the construction looks to be about the same level as the other one.I\'m giving it 4 stars despite the shortcomings because it is significantly cheaper than the other toothbrush. I think they balance each other out (I\'d rate my existing toothbrush 4 stars as well).For me at least, an electric toothbrush cleans teeth much better than manual brushing and although I\'m definitely not a dentist, I recommend them."

While the Sonicare still has more bells and whistles overall (this could be due to model difference), I\'m willing to sacrifice those little things for what I think is probably one of the two criteria that actually matter: 1) how well the brush cleans and 2) how clean the brush stays.

I have sensitive teeth at the gum line and my dentist said that the \'sonic\' action irritates the sensitivity and to use only once a day (use regular toothbrush on other brushings).  I like using electric toothbrushes because I have forearm and elbow pain from the manual tooth brushing up and down action. Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms. I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  The negative reviews I read seemed like they were isolated instances of the toothbrush going out shortly after purchase, and was not the \'norm.\'  I thought that if I ended up with a \'bad egg\' toothbrush, Amazon would replace easily (as stated in some reviews I read).  I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  And surprisingly, the little \'rubber pieces\' that act as \'floss action\' actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums feel great and look clean after brushing.  Some other bonus items I liked about this product: came with 2 brush heads, so won\'t need to replace heads for at least 6 months; also liked the 2 minute timer alert, but not shutting off so I can finish brushing when I chose to turn it off.

To be Honest, this is the best toothbrush I\'ve ever owned.  I have been using the floss head with the braces and my lord does it do a great job! My teeth feel like I just got out of the dentists office, and it gets anything out of my teeth that get stuck due to the braces.  Another huge plus is that its able to get in everywhere with hardly any pressure which is great because I had concerns about bleeding, plaque buildup + getting white streaks on my teeth.  Overall the Oral-B is easy to use, the silly little smiley face lets you know when the 2 minutes are up as well as the brush heads pulsing. I rinse off the unit and remove/rinse the head and keep it in the holder and everything stays nice and neat.

I have always loved these brushes because the bristles are so stiff.  They remain in almost new condition for a couple of months.  They do a wonderful job cleaning and brushing is a pleasure instead of a chore.  (I have tooth sensitivity and I love the stiff bristles--soft bristles bother my teeth.)  Today I accidentally picked up the Crossaction Pro-Health and I was certainly disappointed.  I noticed the last set of bristles was green instead of white and the head size said large instead of full, but I thought Oral-B had just done a product makeover.  To my disappointment, the Crossaction Pro-Health cannot compare to the original Crossaction.  I just bought the Pro-Health today and the bristles are softer than those of my 3 month old used original Crossaction brush.  If Pro-Health was in big letters and they didn\'t look so similar I wouldn\'t complain, but the toothbrushes look exactly alike and Pro-Health is *tiny* on the packaging, so small that I didn\'t even notice it until I got the packaging out of the trash to include the UPC in my letter to Oral-B regarding the suspected makeover.  And that is how long it took me to realize that Oral-B hadn\'t done a makeover, I just bought the wrong brush.  Ugh...  Do yourself a big favor and buy the Oral-B Crossaction Toothbrush instead of the Oral-B Crossaction Pro-Health Toothbrush.

My teeth whitened a little bit at first and the overall health of my mouth improved greatly.  I will never switch back to a traditional toothbrush, even though it\'s costlier for this one and the refills.  I figure I\'ll save much more than that in the long run and just the way my mouth feels now makes it worth the cost.  The box comes with everything you\'ll need.

The fakes are also getting very hard to spot apparently, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct.

Any retail store you go to this is going to be around $140-$160.I will start with the pros. The first time I started using the Oral B 5000 toothbrush I noticed how clean my teeth felt after brushing. I have been using this product for over a month now and love the pressure sensor. That is the main reason why I bought this product is because I have a habit of brushing hard. It has 4 dedicated modes which are great and one mode with extended time. I switch modes pretty much every time I use it. My teeth are getting slightly whiter after a month. The wireless brushing guide/clock is really handy so you can see what mode you are on and how much time you have been brushing. The charging base is great and very portable compared to other models.Now the cons. There are only a few things that I can think of that aren\'t that great with this toothbrush. The display mode on the handle really bugs me. It just displays the battery and nothing else. This is pretty pointless especially when you travel. Because it doesn\'t tell you which mode you are in so you have to go by feel to figure which mode you want. The display of the battery is so large it makes me wonder how much battery it drains to display that thing because its always on. That brings me to my next point is the life of the battery. It says in the manual that the life is 10 days. But seems to be less than that. My girlfriend has the 4000 and hers lasts longer than mine. Her display is for the battery is smaller and in the corner of the display instead of enourmous and in the middle.

However, as soon as I looked at the brushes through the clear package, I could tell that the brushes are knock-offs.  I had recently bought the same exact 3-pack from a store, so I compared the ones I got to the genuine oral-B refills, and noticed the following: the bristles are not really standing straight up like the real ones, the center bristles are of different color, and even the \'oral-B\' trademark on the brushes are of different color (the trademark should be blue, but the one on the fake brushes are gray) and small than the real ones.  the packaging looks almost the same (the fake package even says the brushes were \'made in Germany\'), but there are subtle differences: the font on the back of the package is much thicker than that on the real one, the \'2\' attached to the 2nd picture on the back of the package is lacking the shadow, and the pictures are fuzzy.

My father and I both adopted the philips sonicare system. I got this for my mom who has some sensitive gums that the sonicare irritated when she tried my dad\'s unit.  She is satisfied with the oral-b design.Over the sonicare, this has a smaller brush-head which can get into smaller places easier.Unlike the original oral b brushes, this is rechargable which is a major plus when you get halfway through brushing and the batteries suddenly die.Personally, my preference is for the sonicare system as it really cleans well, but even my father has tried this and thinks it might be doing a better job than the sonicare.Time will tell and I\'ll update my review with new info as the checkups come in.  Since we had used the AA battery verion before, we had extra brush-heads to all try the unit which is good in a family environment.  I think we felt the purchase price of the sonicare alot more since I don\'t live at home and had to buy my own.  I think the pricepoint oral b managed to hit at 1/4 the price of the sonicare system is a very affordable way for people to add a powered brush to their oral hygene."

And then, there is the rare product that comes along which goes beyoyond the hype and acclaim. And which exceeds all expectations. Allow me to introduce to you the latter, the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush. I will not take up too much time by reiterating all the 5-star reviews. But do read these reviews; because they are right on the money. One review in particular claimed how using this product cured his bad breath problem. This claim really got my attention. I too suffered from bad breath. And no amount of brushing or tongue scraping would solve the problem of bad breath. So this claim along with many of the other positive reviews persuaded me to give the Oral-B a try. Results...Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Upon initial use it felt like I had been to the dentist office for a dental cleaning (and like so every time after use). And yes...no more bad breath...simply amazing!  Is the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush worth the price? Consider the convenience of getting a truly professional dental cleaning (at home) without having to go to a Dental Hygienist. Also, consider the cost involved of going to a dental hygienist for cleaning every six months or so. The Oral-B is worth the price many many many times over.  Note: If you have not had cleaning for a while (or not good cleaning), you may experience slight bleeding of the gums for a couple of weeks of use. As the toothbrush rids your dentals of the old and new trapped food particles (which will turn to plaque via bacteria if not cleaned of), you will experience bleeding less and less until no more. Be advised, the sticker that attaches the timer/clock to a surface, like a wall, is of industrial strength. When it sticks it stays sticked. You may pull away some of your wall, or other used surface, if you try to remove it after sticking it on. Like me, you may choose not to use sticker and just place timer/clock on sink counter-top (or a stand for eye level). However, I now use the timer/clock as a bathroom clock mostly. Because the the Oral-B toothbrush device also has a built-in timer guide. The quadrant cleaning method illustrated in the user manual seemed a bit tedious for me. I have developed a more desirable method for myself. This procedure is as follows: starting from the top chop going left outer...moving to back then going inner around to other side until at that back then around that outer side to where I started (spending a second or two on each tooth). And likewise with my bottom chop. Time-wise, the whole procedure takes around two minutes or so. You can follow the user manual guide or develop your own strategy. The main thing is to make sure that you reach all tooth and gum areas (top and bottom chops; inner and outer surfaces, and top of dentals).  Now then! How quickly should you get the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush? Don\'t walk. Don\'t skip or hop! Don\'t even run!! But warp-speed!!! And seek a desirable  merchant to acquire this dental magician."

I got a set of sensitive heads because I have sensitive gums and never tried the other heads.  I like the sensitive heads.  Between flossing and brushing with this thing, my teeth feel almost as clean as walking out of a dentist office.  I used to see plaque build-up between visits behind my lower incisors.  This brush manages to clean that plaque away.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  In the past, I\'d occasionally see bleeding gums while flossing.  I haven\'t seen that recently.The toothbrush felt funny to use at first.  My teeth felt like they were \'buzzing\' a little after brushing.  I don\'t notice that any more.  The handle feels bulky, but I\'m able to maneuver it fine now and I can certainly clean more tooth surfaces with this brush than my old non-electric brush.  What\'s nice is that you simply have to position the brush properly and it vibrates to perform the cleaning.  I like the wireless timer that guides me through brushing 30 seconds in each quadrant.Set-up could have been easier.  Instructions were so-so and removing the back cover of the clock/timer was more difficult than it should have been.  But, day-to-day use is easy and rewarding.After using for 6 months, the wireless display became very finicky over batteries.  It goes haywire if the battery isn\'t fully charged.  The first set of batteries lasted 6 months.  I replaced with fresh energizers; they lasted only two months.  I checked the energizers with my multimeter and they register solidly in the \'good\' range---the batteries are fine."

I have used at least 40/50 of these over the years. That has happened twice to me. But it\'s fairly easy to open it (you need to pry it open with something sharp enough) and get the floss out.

It replaced my manual toothbrush years ago and has been very satisfactory. I do a fair amount of traveling and have been using an inexpensive, grocery store purchased AA battery powered model that has provided fair results.I have been using the vitality in my travels and am very pleased with the results. It has the dual heads that leave my mouth tasting fresh and clean and is far superior to the grocery store offering. To be sure it is much more expensive but the results, to me, are worth the extra cost. In addition to the dual head brush the timer is a nice touch and I have found that while it says the battery requires 16 hours to charge that apparently means to fully charge. I use the Vitality every morning and night during my travels and plug it in when checking into the motel room and find it always has an adequate charge.I agree with other reviewers that a travel case would be very handy as would a light indicating when the unit is charged. I am a bit worried about the battery used by OralB in this product after reading another reviewers comments as to the battery being of old technology and perhaps not as good as AA batteries. I intend to continue to use this unit extensively and will see how the battery performs. If there is a significant failure of some type I will update this review.So, overall I am pleased with this unit and recommend it without reservations except for the battery issue which may or may not be a problem.

I bought the toothbrush for my husband as a gift since his dental hygienist had recommended he use one and suggested the Oral-B (he drinks a lot of coffee).  I also bought another Oral-B Professional Care model for myself but without the clock or toothbrush holder as I didn\'t have the room on the shelf where I keep the electric toothbrush in another bathroom, and am just as pleased with it.  However, had I bought the same model, I read in the directions that there was a step necessary so one unit would not interfere with the other if they were too close to each other.  I\'m contemplating buying a third electric toothbrush to keep in my second home (my husband will probably take his with him, but mine doesn\'t have a traveling case, and with all I take back and forth, it\'s just as easy to keep one in each place).  I will add that I like the Oral-B better than the Sonicare I use there.

A company should stand behind their product; offer, at the very least, a reasonable outlet to recycle something.

This brush cleaned deeper between my teeth than my standard brush ever has.  It really was an impressive sight to see.I\'m not saying to buy this toothbrush as an excuse to not floss, but if you do skip flossing; this brush will do a portion of that job.Their is a timer that after 2 minutes it stops briefly then keeps on going and repeats this cycle 2 or 3 times and then just keepes moving like normal so you know it\'s likely been long enoughI have only been using this for about two weeks and have had no battery, or any other issues at this point.To me this is a really good toothbrush that lets me get my teeth and gums cleaner than I had been.

That\'s the way I felt after using this toothbrush.I\'ve tried plenty of motorized toothbrushes in the past, from expensive to the cheapies you can grab for six bucks at a supermarket, but I\'ve always returned to a standard manual brush. Not this time, though.The Vitality is really incredible. The included two-brush heads (and you get two of them) have an oscillating section at the top, and a section that goes back and forth beneath it. While one polishes and cleans one tooth, the other is getting between them, almost making floss redundant (I said almost). It even has a timer that goes off after two minutes, pulsating the motor a couple of times to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing.After charging it up for 16 hours (which they say will give you a week of twice-a-day brushing sessions), I followed the manufacturer\'s suggestions for how to use it (yes, I actually read them - all part of the review), and can honestly say no other home toothbrush has ever made my teeth feel so clean.Additional brush heads are available in various styles, though why I\'d ever want anything beyond the two brush style that came with it eludes me (they do make a polishing head though, which I suppose I can understand even if I\'m not personally interested). According to the instructions, each head should last about three months, and with refils costing about four bucks per head (in a package of six), that nets out to about 12 dollars a year for refils: a steal for how well this works.I\'m already buying another for my kids\' bathroom: because it comes with two heads they can each have one (downside: no color coding, so I\'ll use a sharpie to delineate them).A fantastic toothbrush that is at last worth ditching a standard manual brush for, I can recommend this without reservation."

The seller (BuyBelowSale)sells the real deal for a very good price.  Even though it is described \'damage to packaging\', they sent me 3 individual heads that look as if they are new."
2831,2906,20101030,B003UKM90Q,5,"October 30, 2010",A43WCF8W3GM8Z,Easy. Simple. Good.,"Opening the clamshell package is tougher than use of this toothbrush.  Really.  That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that\'s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it\'s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you\'ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It\'s not like they\'ll go stale in the linen closet.Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.Hints:Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you\'re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you\'re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you\'ll do a serious \'eewwww.\'  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.  This is important.Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger. This will make that weekend maintenance simpler.That\'s it! Now get one for yourself and see."

Talk about professional, Oral-B wasn\'t kidding when they named this toothbrush.I researched, on consumer reports and feedbacks, and was torn between this Oral-B toothbrush and the UV Sanitizer Sonicare.  They were both rated highly, but had an older version of a Sonicare for 6 years that putter out.  So I opted for this new Oral-B, and what a pleasant surprise!The coffee stains on the backside of my teeth that the Sonicare couldn\'t get, are disappearing w/this toothbrush.  Although it could be said that the Oral-B\'s smaller toothbrush head makes you brush longer (Sonicare\'s toothbrush head is larger) and or reaches hard to clean areas. Either way, the stains are going away now since I brush a Minimum of 4 minutes 2 X\'s a day (w/Sonicare I brushed the standard 2 minutes 2X\'s a day).Thanks Oral-B!

It also helped at the time that there was a 50% rebate from Oral-B (which was received in 3 weeks, not bad for a rebate). So for one, it was a good deal at a post-rebate of $54.99.This was a perfect set-up for my husband and me. It came with a floss head and I already had a whitening brush head. When we unpacked, we set it up next to the counter plug (I don\'t like to have wires spread everywhere) and placed the timer on the mirror at my eye level.The timer shows a round diagram (to represent your mouth) and it times 30 seconds a section.

The timer display also shows what mode you are like normal or gentle and if you are brushing too hard.The brush has been working well for both my husband and I. The brush does make noise, and since there is not doorseparating our sink from the bedroom, I do have to go into the enclosed toilet/ bathtub room to brush when my husband is sleeping. Also, there is only one brush so you either have to brush one after another or use another oral-B professional brush, which we already had (the Professional 1000).My husband dentist thanked him for flossing (which he doesn\'t), and my dentist said that my gums looked a lot healthier and my teeth were very white. My dentist even is going to order me 2 new brush heads every time I come in (about every 6 months) instead of the standard toothbrush.I would recommend this brush to everyone.

I figured that maybe there was just a difference in packaging for online markets. Well I guess that I should have questioned things more because I am convinced that I could not have received authentic OralB Floss Action brush heads. The brush heads I got all broke very soon after beginning to use them. I usually get about three months from each brush head as is indicated on the packaging for the heads. With these here, the brush heads all started coming loose easily move back and forth after only a few weeks. This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing. That was not enjoyable! I would say that these brush heads were either some kind of knock-off, or maybe someone found a way to sell the brush heads that were rejected in production. I guess that the lower than usual price for them should have been the first thing to question. I won\'\'t make the same mistake again."

There are youtube videos that demonstrate hack jobs requiring the user to break the seals and remove solder points and circuit board components, but I don\'t consider that to be a user friendly service by any means. This is a serious design flaw that one might suspect as being intentional (a battery costs about twenty bucks, but Braun/Oral-B would probably rather sell a whole new system for over a hundred bucks). This also makes it difficult to recycle the battery apart from the rest of the plastic and electronics. This is not a green technology and it is obvious that Braun/Oral-B do not care about customers or the environment very much.

I brush at least 3 times a day, use whitening strips and whitening toothpaste but...I hate flossing!  My teeth are extremely tight and flossing causes bleeding and swelling of my gums.  My dentist has told me that I need to floss regularly since my gums are receding.  This toothbrush a little louder than I expected, but remember this is my first power toothbrush.  I really like the two minute timer feature becuase my dentist always told me that I was always \'over\' brushing.  Since brushing with an up and down movement can wear off the enamel (as told by my dentist), the Oral-B toothbrush uses oscillating and rotating movement which dentists prefer.  The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited warranty.Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.  Gets my teeth clean and seems to do an alright job at cleaning around my gum line.  It does not replace my yearly cleaning by my dentist, but hopefully the dentist will see an improvement with my gums on my next visit."

I do not need all the bells and whistles they offer and this one had everything I need.I have been using it for about a month now and really like it.  It holds a charge really well and it came fully charged.  The 2 minute dentist recommended time indicator is great.  I find I brush longer now and pay more attention to each area because I know I will be reminded when it is time to change areas.  I have used a smaller toothbrush for years and found this one to be a perfect size brush as well as the handle is not that much bigger than a manual toothbrush.  The only thing that I don\'t love is the cord is in the base - not detachable so the base needs a larger space to accomidate the cord.  Not a large space but more than it would if the cord was detachable.I would definately buy another or recommend it to others.

So goes my old fashioned \'manual\' toothbrush for a newfangled electric model. Okay, so I am not so old that I actually talk that way, but sometimes change is hard.As this is my first powered toothbrush, I cannot offer any comparison to models of old, but I can tell you that using the Oral-b 3000 is surely a different experience from just plain old brushing. First off, the round head shape definitely seems to do a great job of cleaning teeth; its shape allows for the bristles to envelope the tooth and I can feel its cleaning efforts at work. And, for those of you who have a tendency to scour their teeth with a toothbrush and scrape off the enamel, the Oral-b 3000 comes with a pressure sensor that will warn you when you are using too much force.Overall, my mouth feels cleaner after just a few days of use and I can tell it will likely make a difference in my dental hygiene.Something to note... If you have a high fear of dentists and their tools, then you should be aware that using the Oral-b 3000 will sound like you are in the dentist\'s chair. Nothing to fear, but it is a little shocking for the unprepared."

I am very happy to have it.- It takes 2 AA rechargeable batteries. A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks. (it depends on how long your batteries hold the charge). Alkaline batteries last a month. So it is very useful for traveling.- Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken. Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.- If you want to save the environment and you don\'t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans then you don\'t like toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries. It is very hard to remove the batteries from the unit to handle them properly.- This is the least expensive electric toothbrush from Oral-B. But it performs really well.- This toothbrush uses the same refill brushes that other expensive models use. So you get similar result for much less money.Con:- This one does not have a timer. You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.- People reported that this toothbrush lasts from 1 to 2 years. Well, the most expensive (about 9 times more expensive) Oral-B electric toothbrush lasts from 3 to 5 years.

I have always used electric toothbrushes but this one makes my teeth feel really clean..gets in between the teeth and around the gums.  My dental hygenist even commented on the difference since my last cleaning (she thought I actually flossed more, not a chance).  My only complaint is that it needs a cover. My other electric toothbrushes had a cover and were easier to pack for travel and the most important part felt cleaner in the bathroom with hair and hairspray used daily, with a cover."
2544,2603,20100801,B003CP12QG,4,"August 1, 2010",A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,Pulsar . . . continuing the evolution of the toothbrush,"Oral B\'s Pulsar, is a battery powered disposable toothbrush that cleans using specially designed vibrating bristles, rather than a rotating circular head.  The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  It\'s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  And children may find it more fun to use.How many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  Typical for Oral B\'s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn\'t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  Separate on and off buttons, are located on the handle.The Pulsar is being packaged and sold in various quantities.  At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B\'s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work."

I could put up a video of my 10-year-old daughter squealing with delight as she used it for the first time, toothpaste and drool spraying everywhere.  I haven\'t seen her laugh that hard in a long time. In fact, the next day I realized some of the white spots on my t-shirt were NOT part of the design, but actually were toothpaste spray from my efforts to capture her on video. As electric toothbrush novices, we over-estimated how much toothpaste was needed.This toothbrush works perfectly fine.  It\'s a great way to get reluctant young tooth-brushers to do at least 2 minutes of brushing because it has a built-in timer, too.  It uses an inductive charging system so it won\'t rust and the battery holds a charge well.The only downside is that in our bathroom, it seemed as loud as a buzz-saw, but that didn\'t stop my kid from using it so I can\'t complain."

Just a week ago (Feb 16, 2012) the battery had gone dead on it. I was pretty happy considering it lasted over 6 years. Granted it was a little more expensive than the 5000, I still expect this SmartSeries to perform as good if not better. When reading the manual on this toothbrush I seen the section on the battery in it. It gave instructions on what to do if and when the battery goes dead on it. I tried to perform the procedure on my old Sonicare since they have the same basic structure. I couldn\'t seem to open the bottom of it and any suggestions would be great. However, I don\'t even know if the battery on that model is even replaceable. When I first turned on the SmartSeries 5000 I noticed a BIG difference that my old Sonicare. The sound was extremely different. The Sonicare had a tight buzzing sound that sounded very well built. The 5000 had more of a loose buzz. It is a bit louder and makes me question if its going to last half the time my old toothbrush did. Who knows, maybe this is a new addition that cleans your teeth better or maybe I\'m just so used to my old one that I question anything different. The Smart Guide system on this brush is pretty cool. If you have kids, it will definitely make them want to brush. There\'s a smiley face that gets bigger and bigger the longer your brush. You can stick the Smart Guide screen onto a mirror or the wall. The toothbrush also has a monitor in it that lets you know if you\'re brushing too hard. There is a red light that is very noticeable on the handle that lights up when your pushing too hard. It is compatible with 5 different brush heads that supposedly do different things. I don\'t know if this is just a selling point or what but I find it pretty handy. Overall, there is not much difference in the 1000, 1500, 3000, or 5000. Just a couple additions the higher the number but the basic stuff is going to be there with all of them. If I had to do it over I would have gotten a cheaper one. I thought getting the biggest and best one would have more advantages. It\'s still a good buy and I have no complaints as of yet."

I owned a sonicare and decided to get something with less expensive brusheads.  the Oral B Pulsonic worked fine for about 2 months....Then it would not stay OFF.  I would turn it off.....and set it on the recharging base....then after about 2 minutes it would turn on by itself.  Really bizarre.  Worst craftsmenship ive seen in any toothbrush.  The brush would no longer turn off when coming in contact with the charging base.  So finally after an hour of letting it run i finally just took it apart....and all the wiring inside was corroded.

I\'d been considering trying out an electric toothbrush for a couple years now, after issues with gingivitis. However, the expense of a unit deterred me from purchasing one. The Oral-b 3000 is a sturdy unit, easy to use, and in a word of a novice user, quite a bizarre experience.To move from manually brushing your teeth to an electric brush requires a period of adjustment. The unit is very easy to use, and comes with features that make decisions about brushing teeth easier. For example, the unit recommends brushing each side of the mouth for thirty seconds; thirty seconds for upper left, thirty seconds for lower left. The unit actually pulsates at you when its time to switch, so little thought is required.Another feature I appreciate is that if you apply too much pressure to the brush, the unit will let you know by slowing down. It\'s a feature designed to protect the tooth from hard waring action. I do appreciate that.The bizarreness of the experience is the actual brushing. The sensation of whirring against my teeth immediately transported myself to my dentist\'s chair (never a pleasant time, in my opinion). Perhaps it was the sound as well. The sensation of a pulsating unit in my mouth brought up images of drills, and cavities; not all together pleasant.One drawback is already mentioned in another review. When the unit\'s rechargable batteries die, so do the unit. I\'m not sure how long they will last, but I would have to ask myself, would I spend money on another electric toothbrush when this one dies? At this point I cannot say for sure. I need to give the unit time to see if it is effective, and I\'ll know more from my dental hygeinist after my next dental appointment."

2133,2183,20110318,B002HWS9GG,5,"March 18, 2011",AW7BGAR3VSIY5,Great Toothbrush,"I bought the Oral-B 5000 brush after doing extensive research. This was my first electric or powered toothbrush. I will not compare it with Philips Sonicare as both are excellent brushes. I went with oral-b as I prefer a rotatory brush over a one that just moves up and down. If like me you are new to electric toothbrush and are wondering if it will be too harsh on your teeth and gums, then I can assure you that I found this oral-b 5000 very gentle. If fact, I would have preferred if it had a little bit more power. I have healthy teeth and gums so for someone who has very sensitive teeth this might be an issue. This brush however has a sensitive mode which reduces the power considerably so you can still go with it.The oral-b 5000 box came with a brush handle (oral-b trimph), 2 brush heads (1 flossaction. 1 prowhite), a smart guide, traveling case, a charging station (charging ring + brushhead storage stand) and a smart plug. An important note: only the oral-b 5000 and 4000 series come with a smart plug (100-240 V) adapter. Others 3000 and lower versions just work for US voltage only and you will need to buy a voltage converter if you want to travel with it. You can tell by looking at the pictures on the outside of the box. Smart plug is bigger as it has voltage conversion circuitry inside it, the other one is just an electric plug. Since I travel frequently, so this was very important to me and thus my choice was limited to 4000 or 5000 series only.Difference between the 4000 and 5000 is that 5000 has a smart guide and the charging station that has a place to store 4 extra brush heads, plus 5000 has one extra mode of operation. Other than that both are identical. The smart guide is not essential for brushing. It just shows you various information like the brushing mode you are using, total brush time, low battery indicator, over pressure warning. It also similes and winks at you! I find it convenient as all the information is in front of me, and if I wanted to change my brushing mode, I do not need to take the toothbrush out of my mouth. The toothbrush always starts in the daily clean mode and you cannot turn it on outside your mouth, as it then sprays toothpaste all over the counter and sink, so if it was not for the smart guide, you will find it very difficult to select the desired brushing mode on the toothbrush.The brush handle and brush heads are made in Germany. They appear well-constructed. The brush handle is water proof and factory sealed against moisture. This is very important as otherwise the moisture will ruin the battery and the circuitry inside, a common problem with electric brushes powered with replaceable AA batteries. The toothbrush is charged through magnetic induction, so it is safe to put the charging station on the bathroom counter, near water. Brush heads are easy to clean and replace. In fact, more than 1 person can use the brush handle, as the only thing that goes into the mouth is the brush head and each person can use their own brush head. The brush heads come with their own colored rings, so you cannot mix your brush head with someone else. The battery life is good and with my typical brushing time of 4-5 minutes twice a day, it lasts for 4-5 days.Finally, about the price. I got the 50% off offer, so the 5000 ended up costing me about $65. It was an excellent deal for me. Is this brush worth $159? Well, I would have to say no. If you can get it for below $100 then it is an excellent deal. Is it better than a manual toothbrush? I would have to say yes! It is 200% better than a manual toothbrush. In fact, after using this you will wonder why you did not switch before.Now, if the brush handle lasts for 3 years and each brush head lasts for at least 5 months, then I will be satisfied with my $65 down payment on this toothbrush.I hope my review was useful. I have tried to concentrate on information I did not find in other reviews. If anyone needs additional information just write a comment on this review and I will respond."

I was livid as I discovered this this morning after speaking to the Oral B rebates rep who also apparently \'just learned\' about the rebate policy changes.

We\'d sing the Tigger song while brushing, which helped make things fun. But I have a couple complaints:1. The whole thing is a little large and cumbersome for a 3-year-old. Getting the back teeth is tricky for him, and when we take over to \'do finishing touches,\' we\'d always end up bonking him on the teeth/ gums/ lips with part of this toothbrush. This made him mad, and when you are trying to convince a toddler that toothbrushing is fun, you do not want to make him mad.2. The brush head is not replaceable. So once the bristles are worn, you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one. Sure, the purchase price is cheap, but like so many things, that is not the \'real cost,\' once you factor in how many you\'ll have to buy and how many you put in the landfill. (Batteries are replaceable but the toothbrush is not rechargeable.) I recommend getting one that allows you to replace the head and keep the Tigger.We are now looking at the Sonicare kids toothbrush, which is much more expensive but which includes two different-size brushheads for growing with-- and bonus, it\'s rechargeable."

Both my fiance and myself use it and we could not be happier with it.Inside the box you will find a the toothbrush, a charger with a base you can separate for travel, a \'Floss Action\' head, a \'Pro White\' head, a travel case, and the Smart Guide (with an additional set of batteries).The charge lasts about 4 days for both of us brushing twice a day. The strength of the brushing on \'normal\' mode is certainly not gentle, but then again, that\'s what the \'sensitive\' mode is for. We always use the normal mode and we\'ve had no issues. The \'Floss Action\' heads seem to work quite well to remove some of the inter-dental debris, but flossing is still necessary.We were a little skeptical about the SmartGuide, but since buying this toothbrush was part of our plan to improve dental hygiene, we decided to give it a shot. We mounted it on the bathroom wall next to the mirror. The thing quickly detects when you start brushing and shows you a diagram and a timer, so you know how long you need to brush. The rest of the time, it\'s a handy clock! We actually really like it.

If you don\'t want to read it all, I give you this quick summary. Great product, well worth the price at amazon. Best clean you can get and has many useful features. I have never had healthier teeth and gums. Read further for more details.This product is simply outstanding and in a class of it\'s own.I had a situation in which my gums are not in their peak condition, and that is putting it lightly. I have had this toothbrush for just a touch over two weeks. I also drink coffee every day, only 1 cup though. Since I have been using this, my gums are already noticeably healthier, my teeth are whiter, and I find it easier to make sure I brush at least twice a day. I think this is mostly because of how much I invested into this product. At this point I have nothing but good things to say about this toothbrush.I also have my wisdom teeth fully grown in and this toothbrush is small enough where I am able to reach them and give them a proper cleaning. My wife is also using it with a separate brush head.The device takes a full 10 hours on initial charge before use, as seems to be normal for most NiMh batteries. At first the backing on the timer is a bit confusing and difficult to get off as the instructions do not help. Once you figure it out though, It is quite easy to master.Positive feedback:Now onto a more descriptive part about the features this offers. Since my gums are sensitive to begin with I can only use the normal clean and sensitive options until my gums are healthier. The other modes are a really nice feature that I plan to use when I can.The included 2 sided tape is nice for when you want to mount it to the wall.I really like how both the toothbrush and the timer give you an indication of when to switch quadrants in your mouth every thirty seconds. The timer will blink and display that you should be working on the next quadrant. The toothbrush pulses every 30 seconds and pulses 3 times every 2 minutes. (I personally don\'t think 30seconds is enough for each quadrant so I often spend more time after brushing to give my whole mouth a quick once over.)Once you get the timer set and mounted it does make a nice restroom clock as other have said. After charging and setting the timer, the toothbrush is easy effective and gives the best clean I have experienced sans a dental visit.Also a side note, I asked my dental hygienist which toothbrush they recommend for electrical as they said I should get one. This one came at the very top of their recommendations. Before this I was using Oral-B\'s cheap $20 electrical toothbrush. The difference is astounding.The container for the extra toothbrush heads is very nice allows you to let the head dry out while not connected to the handle. They brush heads are very easy to remove and clean. The different color rings are very helpful if you have more then 1 person using the same style brush head.The travel pack is a really nice and touch and is compact too.Best clean you can get without visiting a dental hygienist.Negative Feedback:The back plate on the timer is a bit unwieldy at first.The toothbrush is a bit loud but not as loud as the $20 dollar variants.IT would have been nice if the battery came pre-charged. It would also have been nice if the timer also came with a rechargeable battery solution.It is expensive and costs way too much at a standard retail store($150).It only comes with 2 brush heads."

From the first time I brushed with this Oral B 5000, I was astonished at how clean my teeth felt.  I honestly think they felt even cleaner than when I would have them cleaned at the dentist.  I even find myself brushing a third time some days, just for the great feeling.  My only disappointment with the unit is that I didn\'t clearly understand it only came with one brush head.  My husband utilized that Floss Head while I waited a few days for our set of 4 Precision Clean Brush Heads came in.  (I think that the floss head would have been too large for my mouth, so I did not order those for us.)  Using the simple Precision Clean heads, my mouth feels terrific.  While I have had gum problems in the past, I find less bleeding with this brush than my manual toothbrush which I had been using.  As some others have noted, my teeth are markedly whiter in perhaps only a week of use, with my usual whitening toothpaste I will add.  I do like the little remote timer.  I thought it more for my kids, but I truly like seeing the time rack up.  I now think I will be using the Deep Cleaning (3 minute) setting as I am never quite done with each quadrant before it beeps and pauses to alert me.  I am unsure how the whitening (pulsing mode) helps, but I use it after a full brushing, and it certainly isn\'t hurting.  My family of four is now happily using this unit.  I would recommend this without reservation."

While the brush head is a little bit smaller than the spin brush it works great!  There is an indicator light that tells you when you are brushing too hard.  I have read some other reviews comparing this to the next model up and one of the  major differences is that the charging station and the tooth brush have the indicator light but as long as you brush in front of the mirror you can see the light on the toothbrush and if you aren\'t brushing in front of the mirror you wouldnt see the light on the base either unless you don\'t have a mirror over you sink or don\'t have your toothbrush at your sink, neither of which makes much sense!

When we received this review copy of the Oral-B Vitality Floss-Action unit, we of course were comparing it against our Sonicare unit. So I\'ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea. It\'s now just a question of which one to get.In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh. We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it\'s doing a great job. It\'s not \'too mild\'. Our dentist praises us on how well our teeth are cared for. I don\'t see the need for the extra agitation this unit gives.There are no LEDs anywhere that we can see to indicate this unit is charging. It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn\'t being wasted.There\'s similarly no battery indicator.Finally, with the Sonicare, you get a blink every 30 seconds to change mouth quadrants. That way at the end of 2 minutes you know you\'ve handled each quadrant evenly. With this one, you solely get a buzz at the end of 2 minutes to tell you you\'re done. So you have to manage your time yourself. I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually - but there\'s many features they left out."

At first, I was shocked.  This thing vibrates (like a buzz) your head when brushing the top teeth.  It is kind of like a dentist drill but much more dynamic.  It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \'dentist office\' cleaning.  After one week I have already seen the difference.  The company advertises two weeks, but one will show results.  It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  The bristles are somewhat hard without the slightest irritation to the gums.  Since this device uses NiCad batteries, I do not keep the charger plugged.  It has gone 2 weeks without need for recharging.  That is amazing.The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  The \'timer\' feature is great and is very useful.  The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  The tiny brush (floss head) supplied with it is useless.  I wish they would have placed an extra tooth brush in it\'s place.  The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  It is hardly bigger than a manual tooth brush.I very much recommend this tooth brush.  There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.  I question whether the costs difference would be worth it."

I\'m lucky to have a great dentist who is working to help me save my teeth and gums, but it requires a lot of vigilance on my part.On a friend\'s recommendation, I started using a sonicare elite.  That brush does a great job, but brush heads are expensive and a little on the hard side.  Every time I brush my teeth with that one, the sink looks like a crime scene by the time I am finished.  The Oral-b vitality did not rough up my gums nearly as much, and it costs about the same as a replacement brush pack for the sonicare.On the other hand, the brush head feels a bit more bulky in my mouth and my teeth don\'t feel quite as clean as they usually do, but I don\'t dread using it nearly as much as I do the sonicare.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this brush an 8, based on price (great), comfort level (nice and soft but bulky), convenience (the 2 minute timer is important), and cleaning (not quite as good as my other power toothbrush)."

The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth.  The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design.

Recently I\'ve came across the money, the dentist, and the courage to fix them  and so far the progress has been amazing. One serious problem with my mouth were my gums, they were majorly inflamed and very, very weak. Along with that there were tight gaps between my teeth, so I could not floss. A friend gave me this and I\'m actually shocked. Not ONLY could I easily floss my teeth, but within two weeks the inflammation(Known more commonly as gingivitis)was died down to a very manageable point, and within three it was practically completely gone.Crest and their entire line of \'Pro-Health\' items have been absolutely AMAZING for my teeth.

Very affordable; it has  a 2 min time built in; a set of 2 AA alkaline batteries last close to 2 months without the loss of speed (some technology built-in do that), but make sure you grease  battery cap o-ring before you close or it will crack after some time (it happened  to me); it lasts  forever  and it does the  same  job as  the  much more expensive Oral-B in the market. Dito.I have posted the same review for the oral-b vitality toothbrush, but it is related to the pro-health model as well.I\'ve been brushing my teeth wih oral-b for over 10 years now, and they are all similar to  the vitality model.  I\'ve  always used the least expensive model since I see no difference from the expensive ones, unless you are looking for \'extras\', like timer, lcd screen, etc. The vitality is a very good brush. I use the round head instead of the elongated.  I rather brush my teeth with oral-b than any other eletric brush on the market. The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well. Oral-B  entry level eletric brushes are the way to  go. I can\'t brush my teeth with regular toothbrush anymore. Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but saty way from the  cheap kind. They are knock-offs  and last less  than a month. The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more. The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings. I think this is annoying. I didn\'t want to leave the brush recharging after every use. So I bought the ORAL-B Pro-Health that uses two AA batteries. It is simply AMAZING. The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better. The batteries lasts forever on the pro-health. I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months. It is the best.  The vitality rechargeable brush gets very slow after 3-4 days. Not with the pro-health. Buy the  pro-health. It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design. Another thing is ORAL-B equipment lasts forever. I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me. And since they are the entry level brushes, I just buy another one of  the same. No need to buy another battery.Again, go with the ORAL-B PRO-HEALTH eletric toothbrush."

We really, really  like the smaller brush head which seems to  be able to clean teeth in  places that a longer, straight brush does not.  Our  older  straight brush seemed to coast  along the front while this brush gets into crevices.  Neither of us is sure that we\'ve ever had a problem because of brushing too hard.  Nonetheless, the warning light for that is a nice safety factor.  High on our  list of positives are the brush head indicator  bristles that let us  know when to change the brush head.  That\'s one thing that we\'ve been unsure of and procrastinated about in the past.  Sorry to say that our teeth don\'t appear to be any whiter so we continue to use the Crest strips."

Those are shaped more like a conventional toothbrush, rectangular,rather than round like this unit.  I always thought the Cross Action did a good enough job so I never splurged on a more expensive unit.  Well, after trying the Oral-b 3000, I find I like the 3000 much better.  I have less of a tendency to \'brush\' my teeth with the 3000, and I know you aren\'t supposed to brush with an electric toothbrush, just move the brush around slowly.  Being smaller in head size, it is easier to maneuver and I feel it does a better job getting  to all the teeth surfaces.  I love the added bonus of the 30 second timer on  the 3000.  At first I thought something was wrong when every 30 seconds it would seem like the toothbrush was powering down, but it just is a timer to let you know to move on.  It has a 2 minute timer so you can focus on doing 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  How fun is that!  The red \'too much pressure\' light is also handy, and I had to push pretty hard to get to light up, such that is was uncomfortable on my teeth.  Some of you may need the warning light, but the pain was enough for me to stop the pressure.  I do like this toothbrush, but I also agree that it is costly and buying replacement heads are costly, so it is a continuing investment.  Still, these clean so much better than manual toothbrushes.  My kids have been using them for years and between the two of them they have had 1 cavity.  So perhaps these do pay for themselves in the long run."

Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use. Why the three stars and not just one? It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip brush.I have both a Oral-B Triumph and a Sonicare (can\'t remember the model number), and find both to be excellent performers. They are different, and each has its strengths/weaknesses, so I alternate between the two. The one shortcoming neither address well is getting between teeth to get out tea and coffee stains (and the occasional cigarette). For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside. My 6-month dental cleaning/checkup gets rid of them, but by month 4 or 5, they\'re back.Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it\'s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains. The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great. After brushing with either the Triumph or Sonicare, I finish with a 30-60 second run using the Precision Tip. Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth using.For everything else, the Pulsonic is a so-so performer at best. Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I\'ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.If you\'re looking to stop or get rid of in-between teeth stains, get this model and use it in combination with another model. If in-between teeth stains are not an issue, don\'t even bother with this. Pick up a different Oral-B or a Sonicare -- you\'ll be a lot happier with it than the Pulsonic."

He recommended to me these following products:1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson & Johnson5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.This is the regiment he advised me to follow:1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it\'s the best time of day for using fluoride.3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \'glides\' right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \'grips\' the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it\'s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don\'t even think about it!5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don\'t have to wonder \'did I brush good enough\'. It tells you when you are done!CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  Once you get through \'the tunnel\' using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care!I wish you happy, healthy teeth!"

Then one day the evil nemesis time took it all away as my Sonic powered toothbrush ceased pulsing its distinctive sound of a million mad mosquitoes.  My wife, as she is wont to do,never wanting anything to do with my inter-spatial toothbrush saw this as the opportunity to finally throw it in the trash. For days it lay in state at the bottom of the can. It was a vision of pure sadness as I knew that now, once again, my elbow must flex and my hand once again must clench the minuscule handle of (gulp)...a manual toothbrush. The thought of losing another energized brush kept me away so for years I maintained only memories of the mad mosquitoes that once blasted calculus to the oblivion. If I had only had that Sonic brush in Mr. Farkner\'s math class, I often thought, perhaps I would have passed. I spoke often to my wife about finding another sonic calculus blaster but this brought only glares. For, as I have previously stated, my wife hated every tiny sonic wave of it\'s tiny brush and nearly forbid it.As I sat in the body conforming chair of my dental hygiene adviser, mirror in hand, viewing my pearly off-whites the bad news came; word by grating word; \'You\'re a lousy brusher\'. These words came from a mouth I could not even see.  Was it true? Is this why she protected her mouth from mine with that veil? For the second time in my life I learned calculus is no fun as she told me I must return for two whole hours of scraping. And it was all my fault. \'This\' she proclaimed after quickly unveiling her mouth \'is an Oral-B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush. and it alone is the answer to your inadequacy\' Wow, it was a mouthful and I was not even sure I could utter that many words without removing the cotton from my cheeks but I still tried. \'A mmmpphh, mmmphh\'. I gave up protesting further only in my mind. \'But it has no sonic drive!\' I though. Seeming to read my thoughts she smiled and curled my fingers around the handle. \'It has modes, lots of modes, and the brush is big, big enough to massage your gums, and who doesn\'t like a gum massage...right?\' I pondered her words as she veiled her mouth again and scraped her way slowly through my calculus problems.As I left her presence, and all the way home on the bus, her words rang in my head. At the first opportunity I searched the World Wide Web for the best price and found a quick trip to the Amazon was in order. I pushed the right buttons and soon it arrived, wrapped incognito in it\'s brown cardboard box with that winky smile. Inside, nestled against it\'s plastic air pillow my new toothbrush rested from it\'s long journey. The air was electric as I pulled it from it\'s packaging and plugged it in. I hung it\'s cordless timer on the wall. I could hardly wait to massage my gums but the book clearly stated I must so I did. When morning came I grabbed the handle. No more clenched fist around a minuscule handle, this baby was large, form fitted to my hand and pulsed with excitement. I pushed the button . The brush came to life. Gone was the sound of a million angry mosquitoes on a mission of blood replaced instead with a sound of raw rotating power. The sound was humanly audible and no longer called dogs from every outside quadrant. At first my elbow still flexed back and forth, as though I were to do the work, but I soon learned I need only relax, position the brush over each tooth and let the Oral-B work. The timer on the wall counted up the seconds. Thirty seconds later the brushed pulsed on and off and I was off to attack a new quadrant.  In just two minutes I was done. The brush had solved my calculus problems for the day and the timer even smiled its approval. Awesome!"

It reuses the old heads (so it lets us leverage our existing investment in heads), but is WAY better.  It seems to spin faster and more powerfully; basically, we\'re sure that it cleans better.  There\'s a visible difference.There are some neat features as well.  It beeps to let you know when you can finish brushing a quadrant of your mouth (like the Sonicare), and a bright red light goes off when you push too hard.  Brushing too hard can wear away the gums, damage that can be very difficult & expensive to repair... if it is repairable.  (Unfortunately, we have a lot of personal experience with overagressive brushing.)We\'ve also tried the Sonicare in the past, and found the Oral-B to be superior.  The Sonicare didn\'t really do a good job of cleaning our teeth.  There are some parts, esp behind the front teeth, that Sonicare doesn\'t really do a good job of reaching.  The round head of the Oral-b allows us to reach everywhere.  After switching from the Sonicare to the Vitality, my periodontist told me she saw an improvement.  I can just imagine what she\'ll say for my next quarterly cleaning!"

1508,1543,20090924,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 24, 2009",A1OZA52DFY3SHD,"Good for your teeth, better for your gums","The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great product at a pretty good price, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s perfect.I\'ve been using an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush for about 4 years now and I really like it.  The Oral-B Professionals have the circular brush head and work differently than the Pulsonic or Philips\'s Sonicare toothbrushes.  Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I\'m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.The Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  It\'s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  The brush head of the Pulsonic is a breeze to take on and off; you slide it onto the unit and then give it a quarter-twist.  The brush head locks into place.  I hate how the brush head gets stuck on my Professional model, so this is a big advantage of the Pulsonic.  The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there\'s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  When it\'s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional\'s circular head.  The Pulsonic assists in cleaning by sending out sonic pulses, similar to a jewelry sonication cleaner.  This is used to blast off debris and break up bacteria biofilms that are populating your teeth and gums.  The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  Here\'s where I feel is the key difference that should determine which type of toothbrush you should get.  I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  The Pulsonic requires you to make tiny circular motions over your teeth and assists your cleaning with the sonic vibrations.  The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don\'t get me wrong, it\'s much better than a manual toothbrush.  But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  I\'ve never had a cavity, but the dentist always complains that my gums are a little too puffy or too red.  After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  I don\'t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.The other thing I\'ll mention about the Pulsonic is the base.  The base has a small footprint size and the Pulsonic simply rests in a small hole in the base.  It\'s a bit wobbly, but it works alright.  The problem I have, however, is that there are only two spots for brush heads.  The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have their own brush head(s) it\'s an annoying inconvenience.So I think the choice is up to your specific needs.  If you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush and commonly have cavity problems, then maybe you want to go with one of the high-end Oral-B models that have a circular head.  If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I\'d recommend the Pulsonic.  I\'m not a dentist, so that\'s just my opinion.  For my needs, though, I\'ll be sticking with the Pulsonic.UPDATE:I went to the dentist recently for my standard 6-month check-up.  I\'ve never had cavity problems before, but the dentist had always warned me that my gums and gum pockets were borderline beginning to show problems.  Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  While the hygienist was cleaning my teeth she asked, \'do you use an electric toothbrush?\'  When I replied yes, she said, \'yeah, I can tell.\'  So, there ya go.  I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they\'ve been in in years.  With that, I\'ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush."

Haven\'t they improved on this over the years?  I\'m still thinking about returning it because the sound is a bit jarring.  Also, if you have sensitive teeth or gums, forget it.  You probably WON\'T like the toothbrush heads that come with this brush.  Thankfully I bought another set of brushes:  Braun\'s \'sensitive\' toothbrush heads.  These brushes are much softer, and should arrive as a set like this to begin with.Update:  I do like this toothbrush, but only in conjunction with Braun\'s sensitive toothbrush heads.  Cleans teeth VERY well! A+"

I bought 3000 series and instantly noted that it was of much better quality than the Vitality.  The brush is super strong, and a red LED will indicate if you\'re brushing too hard. Another bonus is that Oral-B redesigned the charging base, making it much easier to clean than previous generations.My only real complaint is that the brush will indicate when 30 seconds has passed by stopping, then restarting suddenly. That feature (meant to alert you when it\'s time to brush a different quadrant of your mouth) is somewhat irritating as it feels like the batteries have run out momentarily. I would prefer a chime or LED indicator.  Other than that, it\'s a decent choice of electric toothbrush."

When it went on sale with a 50% rebate, the gloves were off, and I ordered one.  I couldn\'t be happier.  I went back and forth about getting the display thing.  Honestly, I don\'t look at it often, but it is still a nice touch, and I now have a clock in my bathroom. :DPros:1.Cleans like crazy.  It really does to a great job.2. Also, I like that it warns you if you are pushing too hard.  I got it, in part, because my dentist said I was brushing too hard.  You just barely hold on to this and let it do all of the work.  It also warns you if you are pressing too hard.3. It comes with a very handy travel case, so you could travel with it and two different heads.4. The charger base and extra head organizer if a nice touch.Cons:1. I wish it would remember the last mode you use and start in that mode.  I use the gentle mode most often, and I wish I didn\'t have to hit the mode button each time I start it to get to that mode.  That being said, it\'s very simple to do and a habit not.  That is my only thing against it, and it is minor.I very much like this toothbrush.  I wish I could get more rebates. I would be giving these out as gifts!"

Haven\'t had a cavity (or anything other than regular cleaning) in 12 years. Coincidentally that\'s how long I\'ve been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush. After I had been using it a year the Dental Hygienist remarked, \'I have to hunt to find things to do in your mouth\'...so I started getting my teeth cleaned once every 2 years. This saves time and money and, to me, this is a good thing in this economy. This type brush head is doing a good job.

I wasn\'t sure if a hundred dollar toothbrush was for me, as I was in the practice of using a regular toothbrush for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time (while I surfed the net, usually), so I thought I was doing ok.  Let me tell you, this Oral-B feels AWESOME and it really makes my mouth feel cleaner in a shorter period of time!  I tried using my old toothbrush again, just to see, and it didn\'t feel right.  I\'ll never go back!!I usually use the regular (30 seconds per quadrant) clean in the morning and the extended (45 seconds per quadrant) clean at night.  After the last alert goes off I usually spend about another minute or so hitting the tongue, roof and cheeks, as well as a quick run around the base of the teeth and gums.  Feels great!As far as cleaning the brush, I let it run for a little under running water, then I remove the brush head and rinse the inside.  I then dry both using a towel, then keep them separate to air-dry a little more.  So far that keeps me from worrying about stuff growing inside or anything like that."

I conditioned the battery properly, so this really shouldn\'t have happened.  The battery cannot be easily replaced, hence the full brush disposal instructions they give you.

All those pieces of information are either false, or just one time bad experiences. My brush head still has its shape maintained, isn\'t too hard and hasn\'t done anything funky. I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time and I just like it. If someone has a smaller than average mouth then, or if you\'re one of those people who was used to small brush heads back in the day (when you used conventional brushes), then this brush head is not for you.

I purchased they for the rest of the family and my 11 year old is doing a much better brushing.I\'ve never had any problems with this toothbrush running low on power, even when I\'m away from home (and the charger) for a few days.Original Review: (Sept 2010)I\'ve been using the Oral-B power toothbrush for a few weeks now and I\'m very pleased with it. Other electric toothbrushes did an ok job, but they usually had problems with getting gummed up with residue or lacked much in the energy department.The Oral-B power toothbrush has a brush head that\'s about 1/2\' in diameter that consists of a small rubber cup in the middle and is surrounded by bristles on the edges. I\'m able to maneuver it easily to the every tooth surface and get the some spots that I couldn\'t get to with a conventional brush. I find that I\'m able to get away with using about half of the toothpaste I did before. As a result, much less is wasted and there are no excess globs of toothpaste getting washed down the drain.One feature I really love is the inductive charging base. It doesn\'t have any exposed contacts, which means the brush is easy to rinse off after I brush. The base is easy to keep clean for the same reason.The power switch is behind a flexible rubber part of the grip and is easy to turn on and off. The brush isn\'t especially quiet when it runs, but that\'s not a big deal. It\'s not deafening either.It\'s doing a great job keeping my teeth cleaned with much less effort than a regular brush. I\'m very happy with it."

While it\'ll be another 6 months before I know if my gums have stopped receding, I\'m confident that this toothbrush has benefited my routine already. First, bc of the motion sensor and timer, I now realize that I have been brushing much longer and harder than I\'ve needed to for probably my entire life. Second, despite the fact that I\'m no longer scrubbing my teeth with all my strength (I actually use the lighter \'Sensitive\' setting with the sensitive brush heads), my teeth look and feel much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush, there\'s less noticeable plaque buildup, and I\'ve been able to maintain that just-cleaned-at-the-dentist feeling for over a month (as opposed to a few days before).

It also buzzes after each 30 seconds to change quantrants you are brushing and buzzes 3 times at the end of 2 minutes.

That may be true in some instances, but what I didn\'t realize until I tried this toothbrush was that most people probably love their electric toothbrushes because they work so much better than a traditional toothbrush.  I\'m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that \'just came from the dentist\' clean feeling.I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in \'timer\' that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  I don\'t think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you\'re done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush, I purchased five heads for the price of 3 of the brand-name ones.The only feature I don\'t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you\'re using too much pressure when you brush.  I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on, I can\'t imagine most people normally brush that hard.  So for me this was not a necessary option, it\'s just there though and doesn\'t interfere with the use of the brush in any way.I only wish I had discovered the ease and pleasure of having such clean teeth earlier - I definitely recommend this brush!"

I had one in a drawer that cost under $20 that I never used because it was heavy and loud so I always thought I would stick to a manual toothbrush, much to the consternation of my dentist.  After reading a few reviews and talking to my hygenist I decided on the Oral-B 5000 and love it!  At first it seemed like way too much technology for something so basic, but after the short read through the manual and letting it charge I was ready to go and it only took a few uses to get the hang of.  The manual was very easy to read and understand and didn\'t really take that long to review.  Another reason that I decided on the Oral-B was because of the smaller head of the brush.  A friend of mine with another brand toothbrush said that she wishes that she had thought of that when she purchased hers.  It really is a great toothbrush and I do really feel that it deep cleans.  My only complaint about the toothbrush is that it is sort of loud, but on the sensitive setting it isn\'t too bad.  But if you need help waking up in the morning...maybe the noise will help!  Overall I really do love it and see it as a good investment into my oral hygiene."

I also like that it tells you when two minutes have passed, which is the amount of time that dentists recommend that you brush.So overall, I\'m quite pleased with this brush and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who is looking for a new way to clean their teeth."

I received it early, I charged it up per the instructions but when I went to use it the brush head kept falling off. Hard to brush your teeth when the brush won\'t stay on. I read some reviews from other users online and all said that it had to be a faulty brush head. I had purchased replacement heads at the same time so I tried it. It worked just fine so I don\'t have to return it. I really like the toothbrush. The handle is slim so is easy to hold onto. My old Sonicare was huge and cumbersome for me to use.

Sure this one does not have extra features like digital timer, 30 sec notifier, charging light indicator, etc, etc. but after using this brush for several days now, I\'ve come to one conclusion-I don\'t miss not having the extra features.

The handle broke a few months ago and I switched to a regular non-electric toothbrush, waiting for a good deal on electric toothbrushes. Found the Oral-B 50% mail-in-rebate offer and bought the SmartSeries 5000 from Amazon. It was delivered yesterday. It came with the 5000 handle, wireless display, charger, 2 FlossAction brush heads and a storage unit for brush heads.I was using the same Oral-B FlossAction brushheads with the 3D Excel, and I think the real technology is in the brushheads, so I was skeptical of the value from the 5000 handle. But when I brushed with it this morning I was really surprised by how much better this handle is from the 3D Excel. I also realized why I have been using electric toothbrushes; manual toothbrushes do not even come close. It felt like I went to the dentist. Absolutely worth the $50 I paid (after mail in rebate) including shipping. I still think the wireless display (Smart Guide) is a marketing gimmick, but I may be proven wrong over the next several weeks of use.I have not used the 3000, 4000 series or the Sonicare, but I would definitely recommend this over the 3D Excel handle and definitely over manual toothbrushes."

I liked the rotating action and effective cleaning as opposed to the Sonicare models I had used for many years.  I was pleasantly surprised by this battery toothbrush.  I actually like it better than the rechargable model. The brushing action is smoother and quieter.  If I had purchased this brush prior to purchasing the rechargable model, I would have stuck with this instead of spending much more $ on the rechargable.  Using rechargable batteries would make this a fairly inexpensive brush to own. I find that my teeth are cleaner, particularly in-between teeth, than when I used a Sonicare.

I was between the dual clean, the floss action, and the whitening one.  After reading the reviews, I decided on the dual clean and I\'m sorry that I did.  While it cleaned well, the brush head was so large that I had trouble keeping it in my mouth and keeping my mouth closed, especially when trying to reach my back teeth.  In addition, the neck is shorter than other brush heads and is wider.  Overall, made brushing my teeth much more difficult.

The 2nd time i was hooked. It does a great joband I can honestly say with the sonic care I could feel light tartar after brushing, so i would use a regular toothbrush every other brushing. This Oral B not so, its fantastic. Easier to clean by far. One last thing don\'t press hard let the brush do the work. I have always after brushing with tooth paste then redo with just a clean brush.

The product is small enough to fit into a standard envelope, but I was sent mine in a cardboard box 30�23�11cm, which annoyed me a great deal.

Then I could alter the behavior so that the timer takes into account that I need time to rearm the brush with toothpaste between sides.  I could also adjust the timer so that it tells me to switch quadrants after each minute rather than 30 seconds.  Heck, I could do a whole bunch of useful things with the timer unit if I could install my own apps on it.

The battery enclosure is rubberized, stays water proof and the whole toothbrush feels sound and well made. It came with Duracell batteries which was a pleasant surprise.2. The cleaning action is fantastic. My gums are quite sensitive but this toothbrush has really gentle bristles that don\'t hurt my gums at all.3. I love the awesome 2-minute timer that lets you know that you\'ve been brushing for 2 minutes with a slightly different \'vibration\' pattern.4. Strangely, I\'ve been brushing my teeth 3 times a day since I got this brush!Overall, I have absolutely no complaints. I love this toothbrush and its a phenomenal buy for the price.

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is currently for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $9.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are 3 of them).  There are other offers through Amazon for this exact same item for up to $19.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!

Upon brushing, it creates a back-and-forth spinning motion and a vibration that is akin to the polishing machine at the dentist\'s office.  There is no doubt that it is superior to traditional brushing in terms of effort to brush and how clean your teeth and mouth feel.  Given the relatively low-price, this could be an excellent option for some.However, I\'m a regular user of the Sonicare (I use the slightly older Elite series), and I can say that I prefer the Sonicare.  After several days of switching back and forth, it was clear to me that the Sonicare is simply better at brushing between teeth and getting the mouth to a clean feeling while being more gentle.  The Oral-B feels more like a polishing experience, whereas the Sonicare seems to get deeper between the teeth and gums and really get things clean.That being said, in reading the literature, it seems that the Oral-B products--at least the Professional Series--are superior to the Sonicare in terms of cleaning plaque (e.g., Biesbrock AR, Walters PA, Bartizek RD, Goyal CR, Qaqish JG. Plaque removal efficacy of an advanced rotation-oscillation power toothbrush versus a new sonic toothbrush. Am J Dent. 2008 Jun;21(3):185-8.).  I found this very interesting.  What I am not sure of, however, is whether or not this lower-priced Vitality line is the same as the more expensive professional series, and if not, how it differs.In sum, this is an excellent electric toothbrush that seems best suited for cleaning the surfaces of teeth extremely well.  I found it to be a little bit rougher and a little less capable of cleaning between the teeth and gums as the Sonicare (which has a larger head, softer bristles, and creates sort of a deep foaming feeling between the teeth).  Still, recommended indeed."

After using the new toothbrush & toothpaste for approximately three months, I visited my Hygienist for a cleaning.  Unprompted, she told me that I had the healthiest teeth/gums of any of her patients.

I liked the slim design and two speed options.  The brush head looked more like a traditional manual toothbrush.  It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can\'t say that they appear whiter.  I find that the 30 second timer and two minute marker to be both helpful yet a bit annoying- its nice to know how long you\'ve been working on a section of teeth but I tend to brush longer than the recommended 2 minutes so it isn\'t broken up to my needs.Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  The Pulsonic seems a bit flimsy- like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  I also don\'t feel like the bristles get in between my teeth like the Sonicare did, either.  The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn\'t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.  I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!"

I tend to always brush on the third level of Whitening.  I really like the light up indicator telling you that you are pressing too hard.  Also, there is a timer that vibrates when you should move to the next quadrant of your mouth.The stand and charger are also a nice perk.  The stand comes with 4 compartments to store the brushheads, as well as the charger stand.

2640,2704,20101127,B003UKKHB4,5,"November 27, 2010",A140FKZ6NPM5QE,Excellent Toothbrush,Bought this toothbrush after reading the great reviews on Amazon and am quite pleased with my purchase.This toothbrush replaces a 12-year-old Sonicare. I was truly sad when the poor ol\' guy bit the dust. After a week without an electric toothbrush I realized I needed to get another and researched Sonicare vs. OralB/Braun. I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn\'t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 & 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I\'m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn\'t expecting that big of a difference.The only thing I don\'t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn\'t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn\'t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.

2666,2734,20100831,B003UKKHB4,5,"August 31, 2010",AQM0K7MBBT4AY,"UPDATED: Amazing, amazing toothbrush.","&lt;&lt;UPDATE: I\'ve been using this toothbrush for a month or so, and recently realized... my teeth have ACTUALLY GOTTEN NOTICEABLY WHITER. The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush. I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well. Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH. I stand by this toothbrush as a high-quality product. It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.>>I have 5 dental implants, so taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.At a recent visit to my dentist I was told I had receeding gums around one of my implants. The problem? Part of it was that the implant crown wasn\'t seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard. The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.I went to Target and bought their generic \'Up & Up\' brand electric toothbrush. This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums. However, when the Oral-b 3000 came out on Amazon Vine, I knew I had to order & review it.The Oral-b 3000 does NOT disappoint. For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic \'Up & Up\' model I was using before. Second, it actually lights up when you\'re brushing too hard. I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I\'m distracted and in a hurry to get to work. It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.Another nice feature is the \'timer\' function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits. This is also nice, as many of us tend to hurry through our brushing routine. The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom. The brush unit\'s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn\'t notice a decrease in power. This is a nice contrast with my Up & Up toothbrush which, though it claims it\'ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.I\'ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far. My old unit is in storage and probably won\'t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas. I haven\'t made use of the different brushing modes, but I\'m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth, will appreciate these.All in all the brush unit, brush head, and charger included in this package are all great and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than, the competing brands/brushes. The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth & gums, the unit pays for itself handily. I recommend!"

In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.This Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more toothpaste.What I do like:>>  The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all.  Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  Trust me on this.>>  The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.>>  I love the rubber grip handle.  My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.>>  Will go over a week between charges.  I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging.>>  Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.What I do NOT like:>>  No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.>>  The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I\'ve ever encountered.  My knife gouged into the rubber hand grip and I nearly cut myself twice.  If you have the option of choosing this with frustration-free packaging, get that one instead.I hate visiting my dentist. Since I\'ve been using these Oral B brushes, my exams are so good my dentist is pleased with me, but he\'s not making the money off me that he once did.The following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:1.  Precision Clean2.  ProWhite3.  Sensitive4.  Dual Clean5.  FlossAction (of course)"

I like the warning light that indicates you are using too much pressure on the brush against the teeth and I like the timer that ensures you do a full two minutes of brushing.

I decided to try it again thinking that improved technology might make it bearable.  This one comes with atimer so you know how long you brush each quadrant of your mouth.  Two minutes is what is recommended by dentist, I can go over 4 minutes and longer when I have time.  My teeth feel so clean and appear whiter after each use.

2614,2677,20100826,B003UKKH6O,4,"August 26, 2010",A4IL0CLL27Q33,7 days so far and a noticeable improvement over a standard brush,"This is my first electric toothbrush, and I am impressed. I really can tell the difference in my teeth\'s cleanliness and shine after only three days. I especially notice the difference on the biting surfaces, which seem smoother somehow. I also notice that when I floss after using this product, there is less \'stuff\' pulled out by the floss. I take that discovery to mean that this brush really does get in between teeth to remove food that normal brushes miss.A couple of other interesting features.1 - after 2 minutes, the brush noticeably pulses to alert you that you have passed the first brushing milestone - the minimum recommended brushing time. After 2 additional minutes, it pulses you again to let you know you should stop, having reached the recommended maximum brushing time. My wife, an exceptionally conscientious brusher, was amazed at how long 2 minutes really is. She had been under brushing for a long time.2 - The recharger acts as a stand for the unit, but you do not need to keep it plugged in to an outlet. A full charge lasts at least a week or more.3 - The unit seems well engineered, is easy to hold and the brush heads that come with the unit seem to fit \'just right\' in the mouth.4 - The first time I used it, the vibration was a bit surprising. It took my 2 or 3 uses until the novelty wore off, though brushing my tongue results is still a work in process. By the way, for those worried about sensitivity to vibration, I have mildly sensitive teeth, and the vibration has caused absolutely NO discomfort to any of my teeth.5 - Some people mention in their reviews that the brush was harsh on the gums the first time that they used it. I agree that the brush is a bit stiff the first time you use it, but after 1-2 uses, they seemed to soften a bit and now the brush seems to be very gentle on my gums.My only problem with this unit is that my wife and I are going to fight over it when I travel on business...Actually, there are a couple of short comings, but these should be easy to address. First, both of the brushing heads (which are detachable) are identical. A color band or some other distinguishing mark would be helpful to people sharing the device. Also, there is no battery indicator. I found out this morning that the battery was dying, when in the period of 30 seconds, the brush went from what seemed like full power to no power at all. Recharging it for 5 minutes allowed me to finish, but that\'s not an acceptable design choice. Perhaps a small red LED or an audible chime alerting users to a low battery will make it in to future designs."

My teeth were bad before but I had some plaque build up in the corners of my mouth.  Now my dentist appointments are a lot shorter.  Also, my mouth feels really clean after using this toothbrush.  The battery life after 10 months is still pretty decent, about 10 days.  The replacement heads are decently priced and easy to change.  I will never go back to conventional brushing.  I bought this with 50% off coupon, i would NEVER pay full price.  Those coupons occur frequently."

I can keep them hand in my purse, buy the TV and in my home office.  I have NEVER had one break; they slide easily between my teeth as promised. I have lots of problems with some floss catching on my dental work or shredding between my tight teeth, but the OralB floss picks have a smooth ribbon floss that meets the challenge without any problems. The pick end works well too, it is thin enough to fit between teeth comfortable but strong enough to deal with larger pieces of caught food. The long lasting mint, doesn\'t last long but that really doesn\'t bother me. I would definitely recommend this product."

They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you\'ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn\'t work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife\'s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you\'re used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I\'m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn\'t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I\'ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I\'m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit."

Users will see a clear difference within the first few brushings.One thing to note, however, is that this toothbrush has a fairly long cord. So, depending on your bathroom sink area and outlet setup, you may run into the same problem I did, of the cord crossing the entire sink and getting in the way of the other things on the surface.

Wouldn\'t be surprised if it was better than the Sonicare in that regard.Replacement heads are a lot cheaper than Sonicare.Amazing price if you buy it at the right times.Bright red light when you brush too hard.30 second notifications and 2 minute notifications.Light and Compact, easy to hold with a good grip.ConsBattery seems to charge very slowNot as good at cleaning between teeth compared to Sonicare (with the standard brush head atleast).Doesn\'t feel as solid as older Oral-b models.Costs way too much at retail price (not docking it in my rating, but this has no business being 80 dollars).As you can see a lot more pros than cons, will be using this for awhile."

While the packaging looks OEM, the quality of these heads is vastly inferior to ones purchased off the shelf at Target/CVS/etc.  The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  I\'ve used Oral-B electric brushes for over 10 years, and these heads behaved very differently.  After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!) during operation.  Also, I noticed that the \'blue indicator bristles\' never changed color at all after 8-12 weeks of use.  I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  I have noted other reviews echo these same problems.My opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...I am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product."

Amazon\'s description for this product says that it comes with three brush heads: \'Pro White(tm) Brush Head with polishing cup: Whitens teeth by removing surface stains,  Oral-B FlossAction� Brush Head: Offers outstanding interdental cleaning, and Oral-B Sensitive Brush Head: Is gentle on teeth and gums.\'  There are only two brush heads in the package.  No big deal, right?  Well, then, why not get the description right?  I am disturbed by false advertising, even at the level of how many brush heads are included; makes me wonder what else is wrong in the description.2. The door to the battery compartment on the SmartSense unit is very hard to remove.  It slides about an eighth of an inch and then you have to pick it off.  That is very unclear and the manual does not give directions on how to remove it without breaking it.  If you have any problems with your fingers, you may not be able to get it open since it requires a lot of force to move the back that one eighth of an inch.  That is a problem, especially since the SmartSense unit is one of the reasons this unit is so expensive.  I went to the Oral-B website to find a solution for this problem and there was none.  The website is purely a marketing site.This product is advertised with great features, and others have given it good reviews.  It had better be great or this is one customer who will take advantage of the 60-day money back guarantee."

At first I thought it was crazy to spend about $120.00 on a toothbrush, but I\'m glad I did. I was probably like alot of you who used the regular toothbrushes that only cost about $3.00 or so.  About a month ago my dentist asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  Told him just a plain jane toothbrush which I switch out every 3 months or so.  He recommended that I purchase an electric one because he\'s a firm believer in them.  He told me what kind he had, which was the Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable made by Oral-B.  He said there are several different price ranges, styles, and brands.  One of the many features I like on mine is the wireless SmartGuide which has a personalizing timer on it.  This helps you brush all four quadrants of your mouth equally. 5 brushing modes- Daily Clean, Sensative, Massage, Whitening, and Deep Clean.  It also has an idicator that lights up when too much pressure is being applied, this is a great feature because I was brushing too hard with my regular toothbrush which caused my gums to bleed.  Since I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 I haven\'t had any problems with it, no bleeding gums, and my teeth feel as though I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  If there is a Con it would be that I had to purchase the precision clean head seperately because it only comes with the floss action and ProWhite heads.  However you also get a 5.00 off coupon to save money on your additional heads you might purchase.  Over all I\'m more than happy with the product and Amazon.com didn\'t waste anytime getting it sent to me.  I hope this helps any possible future buyers. Semper FI"

This toothbrush is far superior to regular brushing.  Your teeth feel so clean afterwards.  I recommend using this product fully and then trying the FlossAction head.  The flossaction just seems to massage my gums and clean a notch better!  Also, each head has bristles with indicators but sometimes it\'s hard to tell when to replace the heads.  Just replace them every 6-8 weeks.  Also, the unit cleans so much better with the battery full rather than low.  I know some keep it in the charger when not in use, but I prefer to charge it once weekly."

I have an electric toothbrush that still charges fully and functions as new 10 years later! I say the same for their shavers.  This filter, ever after YOU break it WILL deliver the same coffee taste/strength.  Beyond durability, this filter\'s appeal also stems from the size of the holes in their mesh, which as mentioned in numerous other reviews, will give you an extra 8oz cup of coffee over paper.  Tip, if you want it to last 5 years or more, remove it and clean it soon after making your coffee, at the latest, when you have finished all the coffee in the carafe.  DO NOT bang it against anything to remove the old grind and DO NOT leave the hot soggy grind in the filter for any length of time, and NO dishwasher!  To prevent the oil build-up on the mesh, simply rinse with cool water outside-in ASAP, and place upside down in natural lit area so as to prevent mold. As mentioned before, the mesh even without the plastic support frame or gold finish will deliver the quality coffee taste as when new and outlive all your coffee makers and your taste buds too!"

Put some toothpaste on and press the button. Oh, and put it in your mouth first, or risk some dramatic toothpaste flingage.The brush will operate for two minutes, \'stutter\' a bit to let you know the time is up, and then keep operating until you turn it off. No worries about being partway through a complex brushing maneuver when your two minutes are over.As for the brushing, IT IS INTENSE.  Seriously, my whole head vibrates, and my teeth are super clean. Only hygienists with scrapey tools do a more thorough job. And with this thing, maybe they won\'t have much work to do next time I visit them.Everyone should use one of these."

This one actually came apart into two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses.

2975,3056,20101113,B003UKR67M,2,"November 13, 2010",A13700AF4X40YG,Small Step Up from Manual Toothbrush,"I got this toothbrush thinking it might be a less expensive alternative to the more expensive sonic toothbrushes that I\'ve been using.  While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I\'m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn\'t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don\'t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I\'d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I\'ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I\'m not a dental health professional, so I don\'t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn\'t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it\'s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can\'t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I\'m afraid I don\'t care for it enough to do even that).If you\'re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I\'ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn\'t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums."

I wouldn\'t pay 100 something dollars for a toothbrush but since Oral B had a 50 percent rebate I jumped at the chance to buy this toothbrush. It promotes positive teeth brushing and even gives you a smiley face after you are done for a job well done. After awhile my teeth feel cleaner and breathe is fresher. I like how it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me to brush my teeth and the travel case is a nice addition too. If you are looking for a toothbrush then look no further this is the one for you.My only grip is how expensive the brushes are I always try and look for specials or deals so I don\'t end up spending to much per a brush head. I also feel the battery life on mine doesn\'t last as long as I would like it to. I think on a full charge the battery light would flash after a week and a half which i feel is a little to short but its not a big deal. Get this toothbrush.

That\'s one big advantage of the Oral B -- you can buy different heads to use for different purposes. The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.My only complaint is that there\'s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it\'s fully charged or when the charge is low. It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors. When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working.

BUT, and it is a big \'but\' the head was too big for even an adult mouth.  I am a grown person and asked my daughter to try it.  She could barely get it in her mouth and could not maneuver it to reach her teeth with gagging.  They need to try and overcome the space needed to make the mechanicals of a swirling AND a scrubbing head able to occupy the space at the end of the brush that is supposed to fit in your mouth.  It is nice that they have designed different heads to address different issues related to plaque and gums, but if you can only reach the front region of your teeth with it, your dental health would seem to suffer.

I have however tried cheaper versions, including crest and cheaper Oral-B\'s. This one is by far the best out of the different toothbrushes I\'ve tried! Firstly, it isn\'t dependent on batteries; it\'s rechargeable, which is great, so you dont have to spend money buying batteries every few weeks. Secondly, this model can be used with a few different brush attachments. the floss action is nice because it has a small head, which makes it easier to get to the hard to reach back molars. If it\'s too small for you, you can always use one of the bigger head attachments (not sure which ones go with this model, but I\'m sure you can find out on the Oral B website or somewhere here on Amazon). This leaves my teeth cleaner than any brush I\'ve used. They feel as clean as if I had just come from the dentist! The battery life is great too! It will last me two weeks with 2x a day brushing before I have to charge it. This leaves my teeth so clean, I\'m not sure how much cleaner a more expensive brush would even get my teeth, so this is definitely worth it!"

The only way I can see this happening is if you fail to twist it all the way into position without realizing it.

A gentle grip is all that\'s needed and the sonic vibrations do all the work.  This brush cleans well and The compact size and footprint are great.  I would recommended it to anyone.

It feels like you just left the dwentist after a very thorough cleaning each time you use it.If I could offer one suggestion it sould be that they should inform the purchaser in a much more prominant way that when you plug the charger in and put the unit in the base there is no indication it\'s getting any charge. I was about to return the unit thinking it was defective when, to my amazement, the charging indication finally came on AFTER the unit had been in the charging cradle for about 10 minutes. I would imagine that many folks will plug it in, put the unit in the charger, see no indication of charging and promptly return the unit as \'defective.\' it\'s not. That\'s how long it takes when you charge it for the first time to \'connect\' with the charger. The instruction manual should make this much, much more clear.Amazing product and a steal at the price."

I\'ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  My gums also feel massaged by the vibratory scrubbing they receive, hence that just-went-to-the-dentist feeling without the paperwork, wait, or cost."

It is too early to evaluate the long-term benefits promised by this product, but I find it a very simple and practical design, easy to store, clean and use. It is slim in the hand and very lightweight, most of my earlier experiments were thick and bulky, and cumbersome to navigate around the mouth. Like brushing your teeth with a flashlight.The Oral-B has a good feel to it, natural and well-balanced, and that makes me more likely to pick it up instead of a \'manual\' brush. The brush itself is rather petite, but this makes getting into tight areas a little easier. The noise was startling at first, a shrill buzz that reminded me of another reason I never took to electrics: it shatters the quiet ritual of morning and evening brushing.But if it works, it will be worth it. I  have so far found the single biggest complaint is that my usual rather aggressive style of use needs to be restrained, or the brush head will twist off of the body. It\'s a � turn quick release, and this is great for cleaning and sanitizing, but it seems to pop off in the mouth rather easily. How the bristles survive until I learn a gentler touch remains to be seen. I have to remember it\'s like running a polishing tool, not a backhoe.The unit is totally sealed and waterproof, as is the charger-base. Makes clean-up a cinch, and with induction charging connection, no pesky exposed electrical connections. Pretty much standard these days, I would expect. Another small but obvious feature that you\'d only notice if it was not there: the motor shuts off upon return to the base, like hanging up a phone.It has two speeds, \'normal\' and \'sensitive\'. I find normal is probably better to use, it tickles quite a but but it is not too hard to get used to. I use the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant. I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits. A double-blip signals the end of the session, as does a mouthful of hyper-foamed toothpaste. Try not to drool, OK?"

Despite the name change from \'Triumph\' to \'SmartSeries,\' there are no differences except for the charger-toothbrush-holding-stand, which has changed from a tall rounded design (which was a pain to assemble and disassemble) to a elongated flattened rectangle.  In fact, if you look at the handle of your SmartSeries 5000, it says, \'Triumph.\'  All of these toothbrushes are the same design, except the 9400 doesn\'t interface with the SmartSeries clock.I have noticed that the price point has stayed similar over the years, and now Oral-B is consistently including the \'SmartGuide,\' which is a little clock-like contraption that gives signals (e.g., time, time of brush, too much pressure, etc.).  This toothbrush is convenient and does a pretty good job of keeping your teeth much cleaner and whiter than manual brushing.  My dentist doesn\'t scold me as much during cleanings any more.One caveat: My husband\'s Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries) had a bearing go out within six months of normal use.  The SmartSeries clock would flash the \'red triangle\' (brushing with too much pressure) caution and the toothbrush would buzz uncomfortably throughout the brushing process.  Although the toothbrush originally cost us around $149, we couldn\'t find the original sales receipt in order to claim the warranty.  Finally, after complaining about it for a year-and-a-half, we accepted the hit to the pocketbook and replaced his malfunctioning Triumph 9900 with the SmartSeries 5000... which was surprisingly the same toothbrush despite the name change.In short:- The price at MSRP is the equivalent of 30 regular toothbrushes, but it does a very good job when it works- This toothbrush is a good buy from Amazon due to significant price decrease (major retailers are still selling it at MSRP)- The SmartSeries 5000 (with SmartSeries) is the same as the Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries)- Keep your receipt for potential warranty issues! Better to be safe than sorry, and $160 poorer due to replacement cost (like us)- 10 hours to fully charge, about 10 days of charge at 2x brushings/day- Standalone charger is convenient to detach from brush-holder for extra counter room or to take on trips"

Better than sonicare essence,This simple cheap battery operated oral b toothbrush cleans really well and the batteries last a long time! I bought this electric toothbrush along with a sonicare essence brush that my dentist recommended. I noticed that if I took a toothpick to my teeth after using the sonicare I could still scrape off plaque. I could find no plaque after using the oral b and my teeth felt cleaner and smoother. My sonicare now sits in the closet and I use this brush exclusively. Doesn\'t hurt the gums either nor jar the teeth with high vibrations.I noticed a few people have remarked that getting the battery cap off is difficult. The trick is to squeeze inward on the sides with some strength first and then pull off. Don\'t pull off when you are just starting to squeeze inward.

The timers is a plus which guides you and even tells you if your pressing too hard. I first bought this a while back ago but didn\'t want to write a review until I fully tested it out for a several months. I bought mine from Oral Care Deals so this review is from their product, and I was very pleased by them. One thing that I absolutely LOVED about this toothbrush was its ability to change the brush tip, which also comes with colored rings that you can identify which person it belongs too. I initially was looking for an electric toothbrush for me and my husband but when i came across this one i found out that we can both use it and all we have to do is to change the brush tip. It comes with a brush tip holder that you can place 4 tips one, so basically 4 people can use this one brush, now thats awesome by itself! We found that the battery is long lasting so you don\'t need to charge it after a few brushes. the grip is comfortable and its easy on the wrist! every time I brush I get the same feeling as i do when i go to my dentist for my six month cleaning. My dentist even said this is the best one on the market right now. Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well. bottom line don\'t hesitate to buy this model (dental professional exclusive 5000 series) because it an investment that will pay off."

It\'s like I\'m Rambo but not a psychopath and with the cleanest teeth EVER. But wait, there\'s more. The other day I was driving down the street and I got pulled over by a cop for speeding. He got out of his car, came up to my window, and asked me for my license and registration. As I gave it to him, I looked up and flashed him one of those Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) clean smiles. It just so happened that he was a user too. He instantly realized, gave me a nod and a wink, and ripped up my ticket. Thanks, Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I tried my husband\'s Sonicare once and felt my teeth were going to be rattled out of my head because it vibrated so much. When I saw this had a setting for sensitive teeth, I figured I would give it a try. I\'m glad I did! My teeth have never been cleaner, nor my gums so pink!It was jarring at first, even on the sensitive setting but nowhere near as bad as my husband\'s. I liked how the timer indicates each thirty seconds so I can move on to the next quadrant, and then when two minutes have passed (since that is the dentist-recommended amount of time.) My husband gets annoyed that the toothbrush does not automatically shut off like his does but I think I prefer it this way because I often spend more than 2 minutes on my teeth. I also like how small the head is; I can reach places on my back teeth that were inaccessible before.The pressure sensor never worked on my model, which is a shame because I do believe I brush hard. Just to test it out, I bore down so hard on the brush that the motor bogged down but still the sensor did not come on which led me to believe it\'s a malfunction. Hopefully I am in the minority. If you purchase this product, be sure to test it out before the warranty runs out.Otherwise, I\'ve been very happy with it.

It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than \'brushing\' like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).2- It\'s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.3- If it pops out of your mouth while it\'s running, it doesn\'t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.4- It doesn\'t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever?

My old brush without the timer worked just fine for several years with yearly battery changes.  After only 2 months of use, the timer function on this new brush keeps kicking in after barely 10 seconds of operation instead after 2 full minutes as stated on the package!  To do a thorough job cleaning my teeth, I have to turn the brush off and wait at least 30 seconds before turning it back on only to have the same problem reoccur after only 10 seconds or less.

My first thought...you just want me to buy a $100+ toothbrush that works just as well as my one at home. Of course, like a fish attracted by something shiny I hopped on the internet to take a look at electric toothbrushes. I probably spent 5 hours reading everything I could on these. A lot of people were talking about the one that has a UV cleaner in it. I call gimmick. Anyways, I ended up with this one and was extremely skeptical.1. The timer is separate from the brush and sits on your counter and has a picture of a smiling tooth on it, kind of hard not to feel like this is a joke2. What the heck, charged this puppy up and waited till after dinner3. Initiate brushing sequence4. Having the handle buzz after 30 seconds to let you know to move to a new quadrant and having it show on the timer is very useful. It makes it seem like it is going by really fast.5. If you brush too hard the handle stops pulsating till you back off. I literally put the brush head on each tooth and just move down, not really doing any real brushing but just letting the vibrations do the work.6. After I spit and rinsed out my mouth, it literally felt like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. They stay smooth almost the entire day depending on what you eat.This was $$$ well spent in my opinion. I highly recommend getting one of these. Don\'t forget, you are supposed to change your brush head every 3 months or so. Might want to price that into your purchase."

I have the more expensive model that briefly stops every 15 seconds so you know when to change quadrants in your mouth.I got this  \'Vitality Floss Action\' brush and have to say that for the money I think one would be hard pressed to find a better buy.I agree with the other positive reviewers on all the important points but most importantly to me is VALUE. This toothbrush does an excellent job of brushing and massaging the gums. Furthermore, I believe there are different specialty brush head replacements that can be purchased. It DOES have a two minute time. In my opinion this is just as good if not better than having a 15 second timer. If you just brush your whole mouth for the full two minutes you\'ll get just as thorough and perhaps more so than if you do 15 seconds peer quadrant because you\'ll have almost as much paste on the brush for the other quadrants of your mouth. With the 15 second per quadrant type of brushing, by the time you get to the final quadrant you\'ve pretty much used all the fresh tooth paste.This is a bare bones electric toothbrush. It doesn\'t come with a travel case but I love it and see no reason to spend an extra $100 for a fancier Oral B or the other leading competitor."

They should have used a nickel metal hydride or lithium ion/polymer rechargeable battery instead. Or, include an option to use regular AA batteries. Ni-Cad batteries are notoriously memory prone and don\'t really last long at all. In fact, the instructions for this unit state not to leave the charger/stand plugged in unless the unit is ready to be charged up. This is because if you charge it when it isn\'t fully drained, the battery will not last as long on subsequent charges due to the memory issue. Oral-b should be ashamed of themselves for incorporating such a lame battery in what could be a more useful product with a better internal battery.Luckily, I have an old Oral-b power toothbrush that takes regular AA batteries and the brushes from this unit fit on it! So, when the stupid ni-cad battery on this unit fails, I can use my old base and regular AA batteries but still use the dual head brush attachment.I can\'t recommend anyone buy this based on the fact that the battery is not viable. If you can find one that takes regular batteries I think that would be better for you (you can use rechargeable in that if you want)."

I bought this toothbrush because of the good reviews and there was a promotion for a 1/2 off rebate.  So, I only paid $51 for it after receiving the rebate.That being said, I really like this toothbrush and am very happy that I bought it.  It makes my mouth feel so much cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.I bought my 3 yr old son and 5 yr old daughter a Philips Sonicare for kids and tried that toothbrush.  I did not like the Sonicare toothbrush at all.  The sonicare toothbrush vibrates and it made my mouth feel numb even after I was done using it.  My son wouldn\'t even try the sonicare, and my daughter tried it, but didn\'t like it.  However, my daughter uses the Oral-B every night (She still uses her manual one once a day).  She says she likes the Oral-B.  I bought her some kids replacement heads (I found them on ebay for a really good price).  She likes the smiley face that shows up on the timer after you reach the two minutes.  She even used it longer to see if it would wink at her, which it does.  She watches the timer while I\'m brushing her teeth and I have never had a problem reaching the 2 minute brushing time.The toothbrush comes with a stand and a place to put four toothbrush heads which is nice.  I have two heads in there for me and one for my daughter.  Once I can convince my son to use the toothbrush, there will be space for his toothbrush head.  I really like the different colored rings that come with the toothbrush heads so that we can keep track of whose heads are whose.I am so glad that I bought this toothbrush and would definitely recommend it to others."

So I spent about 40 minutes at the grocery store agonizing over my choice, and finally picked the Vitality due to its reasonable cost and the included replacement head. So far I really like it for getting my teeth clean without my feeling like I have to scrub. I notice I don\'t put near as much pressure on my teeth and gums as I used to. I still may switch to the sensitive heads, though, as my gums feel a little worn after brushing. I like the timer too.The only things I wish could be improved are the packaging (I almost cut my hand off removing the brush!) and the lack of a charger light. Otherwise I think this is a good buy and am looking forward to good report at my next dentist appointment.**UPDATE:**I did switch to the sensitive head and I like that better. My teeth still feel clean, and the brush is much gentler.

I had been on a regular gum check and deep cleaning for years, and it is now removed--and the only big change I made was this toothbrush.  It is excellent with the gum cleaning (I alternate between the Floss Action a the Precision Clean heads).  Unlike previous Oral B\'s I\'ve owned, I like that this one does not reset the timer when you turn it off for a few seconds (in order to clear the foam and toothpaste!).  The charger is much smaller than previous Oral B stands. I agree with the previous review about the \'Smart Guide.\'  I didn\'t order this one specifically for the smart guide, but it came with it for only a little more.  It works great as a bathroom clock, and it helps me balance the quadrants and notes when I\'m pressing too hard).Absolutely no comparison and while it may seem expensive, it is WELL worth it!"

They last a lot more than 3 months - which is the standard time tooth brush companies tell you to change to a new brush. I brush at least twice a day with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and I get about 5 months per head (sometimes longer). They clean my teeth well and do a great job at stimulating my gums. These brush heads are hard to find in stores and when I do find them they are very expensive. Amazon\'s price is much cheaper so I always get it on Amazon.

1106,1131,20080428,B000AUIFCA,4,"April 28, 2008",A3VYKXHQDICC6,OK,"I\'ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for the last 10+ years. Usually, I buy the regular, round Flexisoft brush heads. The last time I tried to purchase them, however, the store was out of stock. But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.They work well. They deliver that nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and expect from our Oral-B\'s. In this regard, they are at least the equivalent of the Flexisofts, and they may even be slightly superior.Braun embeds 4 little rubber \'paddles\' into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss. I can not detect any \'flossing\' from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess. It may be that the \'paddles\' do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell. They cause no discomfort. The brushing feels slightly different, but not unpleasant.The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers. Rather than being circular, like the regular heads, it is an oval. The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large. I think that one of the Oral-B\'s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth. That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.When I need to replace these, I will look for the regular Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. In my opinion, those are the best. But if I can\'t find them, I would not hesitate to buy these again.***UPDATE 2/2011: It amazes me, but there appears to be a *thriving* market in counterfeit Oral-B Brush Heads! I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon. Under the price, where it says \'Sold By\' make sure that it says \'Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\' If it doesn\'t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \'More Buying Choices,\' and see if you can find one that says Amazon. Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don\'t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon."

At night I set it on the 3 minute deep clean setting which then makes me want to follow up with flossing to get maximum clean! I\'m sure I have never spent 3 minutes brushing my teeth prior to having the wireless timer that comes in the box. The handle feels very substantial in my hand, runs very smoothly, and holds its charge for several days. I previously had the cheaply made $30 Oral-B unit and I disliked using it so much that I\'m sure I hurried to finish and did not clean my teeth very well. It vibrated too much and the brush head was way too small. The SmartSeries 5000 is a joy to use.

If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It\'s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one\'s teeth during brushing.I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one\'s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.So, it\'s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs."

And, there is no sense in repeating all of the great things in all of the excellent in-depth reviews on this Oral-B Toothbrush.Con:  THE WIRELESS SMART GUIDE\'S CLOCK CAN ONLY BE SET AT 12:00.Response:  The wireless smart guide clock can be set to either 12 or 24 hour a day clock.And, I love having the clock sitting on my bathroom counter top to help me keep track  of my morning schedule.Con:  YOU REALLY DON\'T NEED THIS PART AS IT ONLY TELLS YOU WHEN  THE RECOMMENDED TIME OF 2 MINUTES IS DONE.Response:  As is stated above, it is also a very accurate clock and can also keep track of the 45 second brushing cycles.  I like this feature.  Also, if you tend to brush too firmly a little red light flashes on the LCD screen and the pulsation of the brush stops.Con:  You\'ll also receive a timer that reminds you when to move to a different quadrant of your mouth; a useless gimmick for an adult, in my opinion.Response:  I am an adult and I still love this feature.  It is very easy not to brush your teeth long enough especially if you are in a hurry.  The timer doesn\'t allow this to happen.Now, some extra PROs:Previously I was a diehard Philips Sonicare user for many years.  But, I was having some problems with my gums and deep plaque buildup.  I finally decided that there must be something better and more effective.  After much research online and with my dentist\'s input, I decided on the Oral-B.  I absolutely love the deep cleaning feature and brush head.  Actually, I never use any other head or brushing strength other than the deep cleaning mode and brush head.  The brush head has numerous styles of bristles that accomplish different things from deep cleaning, removing plaque, cleaning between teeth, massaging gums, etc.  You couldn\'t give me my Philips Sonicare back.My original hesitance was the price.  But, it was worth the money considering I only have one set of teeth and gums.One minor CON:  The user manual was not written to be user friendly.  It does a poor job of explaining how to set the Smart Guide Clock features.  Just be prepared to read it carefully and keep it nearby for a few days.  When you consider all of the awesome features, the user manual is not worth losing a start or a half star."
423,431,20050817,B0000C4KJV,4,"August 17, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one\'s teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.2.  Waxed floss is \'waxed\' to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don\'t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: \'If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away\'.I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.Jim \'Konedog\' Koenig, DDS"

You have to count to four without electronic assistance (Four 30-sec treatments equal 2 minutes which is my Dentist\'s recommended brushing time.)Also as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars. Most toothbrushes -- both electric and non-electric -- fail this test.

Additionally I find their recharge mechanism ingenious, there are no connectors, near as I can tell, it must use a magetic field. What I mean is that the recharge station and linking area on the brush are all both entirely covered in plastic, so there are no \'vulnerable\' spots for bathroom water to reach to short things out or gum up the works.I also find that I take longer brushing my teeth when I use an electric brush, I\'m not sure why I do so, I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.There is one major design flaw though. The moving bristle head has too much clearance between it and the rest of the brush, because it regularly, at least once a day, pinches the inside of my lips or cheeks, often to the point of breaking the skin, and at least once a week bad enough to make my spit turn completely red.It could be that my brush head is defective, I don\'t know, but it definitely happens, and it never happened with any of my previous electric toothbrushes."

I mean, it\'s a toothbrush after all. WRONG. Once you\'ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you\'ll never go back.Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  Always have.  Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  However, I went ahead and gave it a try.In less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  I put on the toothpaste and away I went.  The best thing is the size of the rotating head: it\'s about the size of a tooth.  Gee: what a novel idea! As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  This allowed me to work on my teeth while moving towards my gums.  In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.One of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth. This was something I could NEVER do with a regular toothbrush.  I also have some very deep pockets in my gums that have a tendency to hurt and bleed. However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  Oral-b is a reliable brand and this is in keeping with the brand recognition.  I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  It\'s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera! ;)"

To be on the safe side, I charged it for the full 16-hr recommended charge time before initial use.  It comes with two identical interchangeable brush heads.  I plan to have my two young children use the brush, however, the brushes are identical, with no markings to distinguish them, so I marked one brush at the base with a permanent marker to indicate the difference.  The brushing action is robust and does a good job of scrubbing tooth surfaces.  There is no need for additional pressure or manual brush strokes.  The brush has a built-in timer and makes a stuttering sound after you have brushed for two minutes.  My kids enjoy the brush and don\'t find it overly harsh or difficult to use.  I was quite pleased with the results and feel it does a better job than relying on them to properly use the manual brush.  The two-minute timer also makes sure they brush for a sufficient duration.  We\'re approaching two weeks of use without a recharge.  That\'s pretty good battery life, considering it\'s used twice a day by two people.  So it\'s a pretty good brush, especially if you have kids or don\'t want to spend a fortune on one of the fancier more expensive power toothbrushes."

Been an Oral B user for over a decade,"Oral B SmartSeries 5000The Oral B 5000 is the top of the line electric toothbrush. I used to have an older Oral B from the late 1990s that worked well up until the point where I couldn\'t find it around my house. The Ni-Accu battery pack was running strong and I could have used it for another 5-10 years. Then I got a few Oral B Vitality units from the dentist for free, which use inferior Ni-Cd batteries and have a battery life of about 3-5 days with regular usage. My old Oral B could last 3 weeks on a single charge.The cool aspect of these Oral B units is that a lot of their brushes are compatible. The Precision Clean, Sensitive, Polishing, and new Floss Action are interchangeable with a few exceptions  (like the Cross/Dual action garbage). The Floss Action worked horribly in my Vitality, but seems to work incredibly well with this SmartSeries 5000. I think it has to do with the RPM/speed of the motor. The Vitality comes across as grindy/noisy when it is operating, while the SmartSeries 5000 is smoother and faster.While brushing in the Daily Cleaning or Sensitive modes with the 5000, the Floss Action brush really works to clean my teeth and gumline. It doesn\'t hurt like it did with the Vitality! The Precision Clean brushes are probably the de-facto standard, but I invite you to try the Floss Action heads just to see how it feels. I also have the Sensitive brush heads that I want to try later on. I can tell you for a fact that my teeth felt cleaner brushing with the same Floss Action head on the Smart Series 5000 versus using the Vitality or a regular tooth brush.What does the Smart Series 5000 offer over other brushes? Well, the 5000 has a LCD indicator on the unit itself to tell you the battery\'s state of charge. Neat gimmick, but I have wondered in the past whether my toothbrush was good to go in terms of state of charge. Wonder no more, because you get a bar graph indicator!The 5000 has 2 buttons: one to turn on/off and another to select different cleaning modes. It defaults to daily cleaning (same as Deep Cleaning), and progresses to feather/sensitive, massaging, polishing, and deep clean. The Deep Clean changes the timer to increase the amount of time for your brushing, but it is the same speed as the daily cleaning mode. The timer defaults to counting up, and fluctuates the brush head speed every 30 seconds to tell you to switch quadrants in your mouth, and does the typical Oral B twitch at 2 minutes to tell you that you\'re done.The wireless timer/clock module is a neat gimmick offered on the 5000 and not the 4000. I don\'t find that it is particularly mandatory, but It does have a clock and changes to a timer when you use the brush. It also lights up a red LED if you press too hard on the brush head while brushing. While experimenting, I found that you really had to jam down on the brush head to cause it to cut power to the brush. Chances are you\'re not brushing hard with an Oral B because you want the RPM\'s to do the work with the brush. I tried SonicAire and other products, including Oral B\'s cross-action, but found the traditional Oral B to be the ultimate.The Smart Series 5000 comes with 1 Floss action head and 1 polishing head. The bristles are also indicators, you\'re supposed to change them when the blue color disappears halfway down. I find that this generally occurs every 6 months, and you can order new heads from Amazon for a lot less than buying them in stores (usually).The Smart Series 5000 also comes with a plastic hard travel case, and a slim charger unit that is more of a ring than a peg like on the older models. This makes cleaning a lot easier. The included battery is a NiMH cell, which means it has a much higher capacity than NiCd and doesn\'t suffer the memory effect. I am going to keep the Vitality as a travel brush, so if someone from the hotel nicks the Vitality, it\'s not a big loss.The Smart Series 5000 is a very smart investment for your personal dental hygiene. I brush with Oral B at least once a day (at night before I go to sleep). My dentist and hygienist always mention how clean my teeth and gums look, so the Oral B must be doing its job!Overall: 5/5 starsUPDATE: 4 MAR 2011After running the Oral B Smart Series 5000 without charging it, I noticed that I can easily get 10 days of normal routine usage (2-3 times a day for 1 person) before the battery meter starts blinking with 1 bar remaining. I used it for about 12 days and estimate I can get another 2-3 days before the battery is totally drained. As someone that travels routinely for business, I can opt to not bring my charger along for week long trips because I know the battery can last at the least 10 days before needing a charge. I\'d push it as far as 15 days!UPDATE: 19 NOV 2011I decided to push the Oral B 5000 as long as possible without charging it to see what would happen. After 22 days, it was still running fairly strong. I can detect a decrease in RPM because the voltage is probably too low. So that is roughly 44-60 minutes of total run time. It will easily handle most business travels without lugging around the charger. I noted that the low battery icon started flashing after 9 days of usage or roughly 18-20 minutes of operation, but it kept running and was still running after a total of 22 days on a single charge."

I gave the Floss Action heads a try using the Oral B Vitality motor unit and thought the Floss Action heads weren\'t very good. About a year later, I put the same Floss Action head on an Oral B Smart Series 5000 and it was totally different. I\'d definitely buy the Floss Action heads in the future.The Floss Action heads are similar to the standard Precision heads, but have 4 extra rubber paddles for \'flossing action\'  or removing some stains. With the Vitality brush, the RPMs weren\'t fast enough or the oscillating action was slightly off causing the Floss Action heads to hurt my gums a little. They acted more like bumpers than anything else. With the Oral B 5000, the RPM seemed faster and smoother, and the Floss Action heads felt the same as the Precision heads.I normally floss before brushing, so I cannot comment on whether the Floss Action heads can replace the act of flossing. I still recommend following your hygienist\'s recommendations, which is usually to floss before brushing.It works well at cleaning my teeth, and it is compatible with most Oral B brush motors.

The stupid timer thing is a waste of plastic and will probably end up in the trash.  It\'s useless and not a smart solution.  It waste battery and it\'s bulky.  Sonicare brushes just beeps and stops for a split second to tell you to move to the next quadrant (it\'s built into the toothbrush).  Also, this thing seems to just rotate and didn\'t do too well between the gap of your tooth.  With sonicare, it just sorta melts it was or the bubbles extract the stuff out.If you insist on this type of brush, buy the 4000 version...even if the 5000 is cheaper (which is not)...because it\'ll save having to buy batteries or waste the planet\'s resource.Again, I hate waste, stupid design, gimmicks.I want to see someone else support me on this.

It\'s lasted an amazingly long time; the battery has just recently started having trouble keeping a charge. (Mechanically, it still works perfectly.) So, I decided to try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush.Compared to the Sonicare, the Oral-b is quite different. It\'s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \'sonic\' movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts. The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \'floss action\' rubber points work quite differently as well. At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth. Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice. I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.(One small issue wroth noting: all the included tooth brush heads look the same. It\'s awkward to share between two people because the different heads look identical. It would be nice to have different colored heads, like Philips provides.)"

After about 2 weeks, the battery display started to develop moisture within the display. At around one month, the display could no longer be seen since condensation had turned into large water globules that obstructed the display.With 4 uses per day by two adults, after 3.5 months, the toothbrush failed to turn on but would activate after a few minutes or sometime in the day by itself. It is apparent that the board has gone bad and the toothbrush is no longer useable reliably.Pros:This toothbrush has a holding stand that can hold up to four individual heads for multiple users, or different toothbrush heads. (Be sure to dry your toothbrush head before placing in case, or you will have a gradual soap scum build up)Multiple Settings for persons with sensitive teeth.Timer that displays vibrations by 30 second intervals for dentistry recommended minimum of 30 seconds per quadrant.Timer also displays time. (Would like to have had the timer lit since the angle is almost at 90 degrees and should be angled slightly higher by about 15 degrees more for adult use.)Cons:The price is high for what seems to be only a timer radio frequency linked display and a few lower setting for strength of brushDid not last long for something that is exposed to soap in mouth and running water when rinsedPower connection is very l;arge and takes up a lot of spaceaway from the electrical socket. (MOst people are limited to counter space in the bathroom)In conclusion, I liked the design and feel of the toothbrush but was very dissapointed that it broke on me after only a few months. A little red light displays on the timer to show if you are being to rough on your tooth enamel when brushing, which I liked but also wanted the motor to be as powerful as previous models. Maybe this was bad for my teeth, but I could feel the difference on the gum lining of each tooth when touching sliding my tongue for cleanliness.since some people have a hard time returning things, maybe this one should be bought in a store with a guaranty instead of online. I will try to contact Oral B and Amazon about a replacement, and will update this review upon their response with difficulty or ease."

It actually would slow down, then rev back up.  The automatic timer on this electric toothbrush is supposed to run for 2 minutes, but mine seemed to run for much longer than that, so I went with it.My other electric toothbrush runs for 3 minutes at the setting I use, so I didn\'t mind this.  You always have the option of just turning it off when you want to.I wish this electric toothbrush came with some kind of cover for the toothbrush heads, and some kind of travel case, but for the excellent price of this electric toothrush I can\'t complain.  It does come with a rechargeable stand, which I just leave my electric toothbrush always plugged in, and on the rechargeable stand.  That way it is always ready to use when I need it.I also like that in reading the information that came with this electric toothbrush, that you have like 5 different options for brush heads, depending on the kind you like.  The brush heads seem to be alittle more reasonably priced too, as I always like to buy a minimum of 3 brush heads at a time.  With this electric toothbrush you can even buy them in a quantity of 6, if you want to.  I like to have enough for a year, which they recommend you change your brush head every 3 months, which I agree, so I do that.If you\'ve always wondered if you would like using an electric toothbrush, but didn\'t want to spend the big bucks, you should try this electric toothbrush.  It works very well, at a reasonable price.The major reason to use an electric toothbrush to begin with is to really clean your teeth and gums, which this one seems to do that as well as my more expensive electric toothbrush.Having healthy teeth and gums is so important to your overall health.  Everyone should be able to afford to have an electric toothbrush. I know some of the electric toothbrushes are cost prohibitive, at over $100, but this Oral B electric toothbrush is under $30, much more doable for alot of people.I will continue to use this electric toothbrush, along with the other electric toothbrush I already have.Iam very happy that I was able to try this product, and very satisfied with the results I got."

Honestly I could have saved the extra money and easily done without the added features.  The Whitening mode just makes the motor pulse in a different pattern - quite irrelevant as far as whitening your teeth.  As for the readout, it looks nice, is water resistant,  and has a clock built-in that displays when not brushing one\'s teeth.  I find I don\'t really look at it other than for the clock.

The head is perfectly sized to get around all my teeth and all the way to the back of my mouth with no problems.  The stick part is slim too, so I don\'t feel like I\'m cramming in something too big.  I love the 30 second quadrant timer (although you really have to pay attention for the pause or you\'ll miss it).  It is also completely waterproof, as I use mine in the shower (not sure if you\'re supposed to do that but I do with no problems so far).  And it has some serious power to clean! I notice after about a weeks use it seems a little slower, still more than sufficient to brush, and I recharge weekly.  I really like it."

The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  There are no recesses to collect toothpaste, moisture etc., so it is easy to keep clean.  I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...my whole mouth.  It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone. I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \'between\' brush would be a good thing to use. The only change I would make would be to slant the head a bit to enable reaching inside surfaces.  All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...in fact it is still working. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the Sonicare, but for the money, this is the best buy. After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  AND, I do not work for Oral B.  Come on...get real paranoid people...09/10/09:  I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  I have not had this problem.  I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed and I can see where that might create the above mentioned problem.  I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  Just food for thought if trying to decide on this product.  I still love it."

Both do a great job! People with smaller mouths may want to try both brushes to see which is more comfortable for them.

I have used a combination of regular toothbrush, Rota-Dent, and Waterpik for the past several years so I\'m no stranger to trying alternate methods.  The head of the toothbrush is a bit stiff compared to Rota-Dent but the curved shape does a good job of getting the gum line towards the back of my (small) mouth.  After brushing with this, my teeth get that slick, super-clean feeling that you don\'t always get with a regular brush.I really like how it charges on a plastic base.  The hole the charger plugs into is all plastic, and the charger itself is all plastic - no places to corrode! It also has a small footprint so it leaves plenty of space on the countertop.

Then we went back to manual toothbrushes for a while.  We realized that the manual toothbrushes didn\'t leave our mouths feeling as clean as the rechargeable toothbrushes, so we decided to purchase a Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.We purchased the Sonicare from Amazon and tried it for a couple weeks.  At first, we thought it did a very good job cleaning our teeth and gums, but it started feeling weak.  I\'m not sure if the toothbrush lost its full power after the first week, but the pulsating just didn\'t seem as good as our older Oral B.We returned it to Amazon as it seemed defective, and purchased the Oral B Professional Series 5000.  We\'ve used it for a few days now and it draws rings around the Sonicare.  The oscillating motion of the toothbrush alone leaves our teeth, gums, and overall mouth feeling much cleaner than anything we\'ve ever used; feels almost as good as a cleaning from the dentist.I highly recommend this toothbrush over the Sonicare.

It really goes by even faster that way- I thought it was going to be complicated, but it is much easier.  I like how the top part removes easily.

Consumers are depressed and clenching tighter to their dollars. Companies need innovations in their products in order to stimulate more sales. I get it. However, simply miniaturizing a perfectly good product (like the full-size SonicCare) without adding more values is hardly worth anyone\'s time or money. What is more unnecessary is to sacrifice performance just to make something more, to quote another reviewer, \'aesthetically pleasing\'. When it comes to my dental health, thanks but no thanks, I will take performance any day over form. Compared to the other brushed I have used, this tiny brush definitely feels less effective. Don\'t get me wrong though, this is not a horrible brush. Had I never used any other electric toothbrushes before, I probably would be satisfied with this brush just fine. But after using/reviewing a number of different brushes from Vine program, I\'m used to that more powerful and super fast cleaning offered by the full-size models. In fact, I don\'t mind - and actually prefer - that slightly weightier feel of other brushes in my hand. Mind you, I do travel quite often, but the old brush fits my suitcase just fine."

If you are used to using a normal toothbrush you will probably hate this thing. It is big which makes brushing more challenging. Getting behind your front teeth almost always leaks toothpaste spit... Also, when using the way the instructions tell you to there is always a glob of un-lathered toothpaste in your final spit out! This tells me that these electronic toothbrushes don\'t work and you are better off with regular old fashioned toothbrushes. I also find that it takes twice as long to do a similar job with this electronic toothbrush as it takes to thoroughly brush with a regular toothbrush.Overall, if you know how to brush your teeth don\'t bother with these electronic brushes."

Years ago my dentist recommended Sonicare and I have been a faithful user of them, upgrading when new models came along.  My dental visits have reflected that use.My hygienist prefers Oral-B and we have talked about it over the years.  I wasn\'t persuaded.  Recently Oral-B started a 50% off campaign and with their 60 day return policy I thought I would try them out.I am glad I did.  I very much like this toothbrush and how it works.  It is bigger than my Sonicare Flex, but even so it feels very good in my hand.  I love the smart timer.  While the Sonicare gives you a beep/jar every 30 seconds, you can see your progress with the Oral-B on the timer.  The Oral-B also gives you a jar too.  In fact, this is the one thing I don\'t like about it.  It is too much of a jar, especially at the 2 minute mark.  It is as if your car is about to stall.After two minutes the Sonicare shuts off.  The Oral-B keeps going until you shut it off.  I am finding that I keep on using it for another 30 to 60 seconds.  Now you can select a deep clean cycle of 3 minutes rather than the normal 2 minute cycle, but I find I prefer going through the normal cycle and then concentrating on the areas my dentist has mentioned as needing extra attention for another 30/60 seconds.The brushes seem to be fine.  I have used the ones that came with the package but also the sensitive head.  I like the sensitive head best.  It is a bit more compact and seems to get the job done.I will know how effective it is for me when I next visit the dentist for a cleaning.But for now, my feeling is that I am doing a better job in brushing and concentrating on the problem areas.I am keeping this and sending in for the rebate."

Today it costs $60 on amazon while the Oral-B Pulsonic costs $47.  If you are in the market for a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I\'d say either of these would be a good investment.  Both have two settings, except it seems the Oral-B has the \'faster\' setting start first whereas the WaterPik starts a slower speed first.  The Oral-B is slimmer, lighter, easier to hold onto.  Both brushes come with base units but the unit for the Oral-B is smaller and lighter than that of the WaterPik, but it also is easier to push around by accident.  The WaterPik comes with 2 brush heads, the Oral-B, just one.  When recharging the WaterPik blinks and when it stops, you know it has been charged fully, the Oral-B does not.I have not experienced the trouble of the brush head falling off the Oral-B brush, and overall I would say that the Oral-B seems more \'powerful\' in its vibrations.  I can\'t say that\'s a bad thing, but after using the WaterPik for so long, it\'s something one has to get used to.  Overall I\'d say either electric brush is a good investment.  While you get a little more with the WaterPik, it is also a heavier brush and more expensive.  In the end, all they really do is vibrate and you have to move them around.  If I had a choice, I\'d probably choose the Oral-B (which I switched to as soon as I received it), only because it\'s slimmer and lighter and I find it easier to use."

By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations. Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.Looks and size: nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).I would recommend this product to my family and friends."

It\'s not that I didn\'t brush after every meal when I was doing it manually; it\'s that these toothbrushes do a significantly better job. Furthermore, although their use has never actually whitened my teeth, it slows down the degree of stain accumulation from tea, coffee, etc., so that I do not have to bleach my teeth as often.Having said all that: This model does not work any better than my trusty Oral-B S-200. It also has the same drawback, that the rechargeable batteries do not last forever and when they give out, you must buy a whole new unit. When in use, the toothbrush sounds louder than the S-200 and different, resembling a dentist\'s drill.  For anyone thinking of using older heads they have around, my S-200 heads do not fit on this model--the shaft is different. The brushes themselves are round instead of the traditional oval--I can\'t see any advantage to that but perhaps a dentist can.Is this toothbrush worth using?  Absolutely. Is it the best value in an electric toothbrush?  Perhaps not."

This toothbrush wowed me from the moment that I took it out of the box. First I have to point out that it comes FULLY CHARGED. Since when does an electronic item arrive at your door without needing charging? I was able to take it out and to use it immediately! The next thing I noticed was how much lighter it was than my three year old sonic toothbrush. It was more slender, shorter, and much, much more comfortable to hold. When I pulled the base out of the box I was simply astounded - how could something so small be a charger? I\'d been used to this huge base and now all I had to deal with was this tiny little thing, barely big enough to fit the base of the brush, but it did and it was extremely sturdy as well.The big challenge, though, was the brushing. My Vitality had a 2 minute warning feature on it, where it sort of stutters in the vibrations when two minutes is up. I loaded up the toothbrush with toothpaste and started the brushing. I could immediately notice the difference from my new Oral-b to my old sonic toothbrush, as this one rotated instead of just going up and down. I could simply gently guide the brush from one tooth to another, just like my dentist does, and the teeth were getting cleaned!Two minutes actually took much longer than I thought, and I was a bit ashamed to realize that I hadn\'t been brushing a whole two minutes for quite awhile! But eventually the stuttering happened and I turned off the brush and looked closely to see what the cleaning had done.WOW. Not only did the brush get in between a lot of my teeth to get some things that would normally be gotten by flossing, but it also polished my teeth as well! I was able to run my tongue around my teeth and was shocked to realize that my teeth felt exactly the same way after my home cleaning as it does after I\'m done a visit at the dentists.I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and am interested in the different heads that you can get to go on the toothbrush! If this head does such an amazing job, I wonder how good the other heads are!"

It was on way too tightly - even my cleaning man - a strong man - had a bit of trouble.  I did NOT have enough pressure.  I always worry about damaging my thumbs because . . .I did damage my thumb joints (both) once trying to take off a cap of baby aspirin.  Go figure!The directions on the baby aspirin said it required two thumbs to lift on both sides and I really hurt my thumb joints on both hands - still not quite healed after almost a year.  I never successfully got the top off - someone else did it for me.  If our 4 year old granddaughter had been here, she  would have been able to take off the childproof cap for me.

It took nearly 24 hours before the green charge lights quit blinking. They stop when the charge is complete. I\'m very happy with how clean my teeth seem after my first brushing session. The sealed box came with one FlossAction brush head.The handle I received says, \'TRIUMPH Professional Care\' and has the green charge lights on a gray background. It is NOT the digital display. My first guess is that this is the older model but some reviewers said they called Oral-B and were told the handles with a non-digital display (like mine) are the newest model, so I\'m not sure. I\'m also not sure if there are any improvements with a newer model - other than the display - that would make me want to be sure and have the newer model? I noticed that Amazon sales of the 4000 model are temporarily on hold while they investigate what appears to be the same issue.For now, I am happy and content with what I have. If anyone knows or learns more about this issue please let us know! The toothbrush seems excellent!Update: After reading through the model 5000 reviews going back to 2009, I now think that mine is a newer model afterall. Originally, they came with a 110/220 volt power adapter with the electronics built into the AC plug which made the plug that goes into the AC outlet overly large (some reviewers complained about the large plug). Mine has just a small basic 2-prong AC plug. Mine is 110 volt only and the electronics are in the charging base where the brush handle sits. Older units came with 2 or 3 brush heads. Mine came with only 1. So, it appears that Oral-B decided to cut some costs by removing the dual voltage and 1 or 2 extra brush heads. They also decided to change the LCD handle display to LED. Hopefully, they also added some improvements?! I\'m still happy."

(Try it yourself, rub your fingers onto freshly brushed surface, and you will see what I mean! :) ) PLEASE BE ADVICE, this item is the OLDER model of Series 5000 WITHOUT a LCD screen on the physical handle of the brush (Don\'t get fooled by the pictures.) It does come with the SMARTGUIDE but I only used it a few times since you will get used to the rhythm of the \'beeping\' from the toothbrush to change sides while brushing. Overall, an AMAZING toothbrush aside from receiving the older model of Series 5000. But it\'s OKAY! The only difference between the new model and old one is that the lacking of LCD screen (as mentioned)from the physical handle and a bigger power adapter. The battery lasts about 4 days with INTENSE BRUSHING. This product is BETTER than Philips SONIC CARE since it does NOT break down after a week."

Turn it on, move it around, rinse it, wipe it off with a towel and put it back in the base, which could be a little more stable, but works just fine."

The kit includes two ProWhite brush heads designed to remove surface stains and polish teeth bright white.  There are three types of brushing fibers in the ProWhite rotating brush, blue, white, and green, each with a different stiffness.  The longest and least stiff blue fibers gradually loose color with use indicating the remaining life of the brush (listed as 3 months).  There is a deep cleaning orange rubber center in the brush for deep cleaning of stains.  I have noticed a clean difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums after a week of using the ProWhite.The handle of the device fits the hand nicely because of its large diameter and a ribbed blue rubber grip covering the back of the smooth light blue plastic cylinder. The cylinder has a battery that is recharged by placing it upright on a plastic stand. The unit fits on the stand with a plastic receiver on a plastic plug, so electric shock to the user is avoided. The entire hand device can be rinsed completely (not the recharging stand).There is a built in timer on the Vitality that alerts the brusher when the recommended brush time of two minutes have elapsed with a noticeable pulsing action of the brushes and the accompanying change in sound from continuous to intermittent. After the timing alert, the device resumes continuous brushing.I highly recommend this rechargeable toothbrush.  I have switched from a regular brush to the exclusive use of the Vitality. I will order the four other brush heads each with a unique cleaning function. A $3.00 coupon for these heads is included in the kit. The rotary action of the brush is superior to the electric toothbrush I tried years ago that used an up and down motion that I did not like."

It is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I\'ve owned, and my last one lasted 13 years. When it started to loose its charge while I was brushing my teeth I looked at what was available and decided on the 5000.I like that it has a space to store 4 brush heads, so I won\'t have to search for where I placed the extra ones when its time to change it. Also, the contour of the handle is very nice.On one of the reviews I read before I bought it, someone was unhappy with the timer. It\'s a nice, waterproof digital clock and you do not have to sync it up with the toothbrush if you don\'t want to. I did so I could tell when I\'m applying too much pressure. If you do use the timer, at 2 minutes you get a smiley face, and at 2 1/2 minutes it winks at you.The one thing I don\'t really like is that every 30 seconds it pulses to let you know to move to the next area of your mouth, but I do not brush my teeth in sections like they want you to. I asked my Dental Hygienist, who also uses one, and she doesn\'t do it their way either.She also recommended that I leave the handle off the charger until the charge wears down. The toothbrush has a \'Smart\' battery and she has heard of people having problems with the battery not holding a charge if it is keep constantly charging. The handle shows how much charge the battery has so I only charge it once a week or so.The travel case that comes with it is another nice feature. Since it holds a charge well, you can take a weekend trip, or a week, if only one person is using the handle, without having to pack the charger. There is room for two brush heads in the travel case."

I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use. This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED. I was initially disappointed as I realized I had a brush head that didn\'t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed. URGH... I decided to give it the weekend before trying to call customer service on Monday to get a replacement. However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions. When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean! Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush (forgot what they call it) and the fact that it continues to brush past 2 minutes. The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines. And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!! And an added bonus is that the replacement heads are even less expensive and the brush it self had a $15 rebate so less than the cheapest Sonicare too.And I\'ve only had it 4-5 days now but I am certain my teeth are already whiter than they were and less stained!!"

It was a basic rechargeable model with a 2 minute timer.  I wanted at least as much in my replacement.  I decided to spend a little more money for more features and I\'m really happy with the 3000 Professional.  I like the fact that it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to another area of you teeth.  The pressure sensor works but I don\'t know that I\'d ever push hard enough to actually turn it on in use.The minor thing that I don\'t need is the stand accessory which has the holders for additional brush heads.  This could probably be useful for a family that shares a toothbrush and simply swaps heads.  I knew what I was ordering though and that\'s why I\'m still giving it 5 stars.

It has a long-lasting rechargeable battery, which charges whenever not in use, and does a great job on teeth with a head that is shaped for hard-to-reach areas.  But the best part of this brush is the little timer that has some kind of remote signal.  It is a clock when not in use (and gives the correct time) then becomes a timer when you start to brush.  I can walk out of the room, even, and it continues to time me.  Dentists recommend brushing at least two minutes - and you get a little smiley face when you hit two minutes, or a big smiley face (sometimes a wink) if you brush for 2:30.  My kids want one ot these now, too, but I\'d say it\'s a bit too powerful for kids.  It\'s a great buy and, while it costs way more than a standard toothbrush, it holds up beautifully and works hard.  It also comes with a carrying case for travel, which I love because power toothbrushes never fit into standard cases.  The battery charge lasts two days off the charger, so you can go away for the weekend without carrying all the gear. Love it."

It is a very nice design and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because it doesn\'t sit firmly in the base and is easy to knock it out of the base, it wobbles when bumped lightly. I also feel the brush head could be slightly smaller but the size is OK, I just like the smaller brush heads. It says the charge will last for about 4 hours which is good since brushing teeth only takes about 2 minutes. This is a very nice pulsing toothbrush for a little less money than some that works well.

Finding a great toothbrush can be a chore with the seemingly infinite options. When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions. Let me say I will be sticking with this one. The bristles are firm and \'aggressive\', albeit a gentle aggressive if that makes sense, while soft making it less likely to brush away enamel and/or gums. This was key for me. Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line. The back of the head of the brush serves as a tongue cleaner. It is really a scraper, so it\'s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn\'t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it. I highly recommend this brush!"

I couldn\'t afford to spend a million dollars on some of the other electric brushes with the *fancy* features. I think this is just as good. My teeth are whiter and my breath is fresher (too much info, I know). But it\'s true. I love the 2 minute timer as well.

The first two each had the same problem -- something in the head loosened causing the head to wobble when in use on the brush.  As it wobbled, it pinched my tongue & gums -- my tongue actually had bleeding cuts from it!  Both of the first two heads are defective, & of poor quality.  This never happened with the expensive heads -- I never had a problem, I used them until the color faded, & then threw them away.  I am totally disappointed in these Amazon heads.

I\'ve used this for less than a week and it\'s broken already.)I am, however, extremely surprised that at this price you only get one brush head, and that the battery is not replaceable (all rechargeable batteries have a limited life span).I can\'t promise you that it is worth 2x to 4x the price of some of the other powered toothbrushes you can buy, but I do like the extra-clean feeling I get with it."

This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.The one positive thing is the toothbrush\'s compactness. It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior. But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare."

The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  I can\'t comment on the alleged \'flossing action\' since I still floss and I\'m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven\'t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  The things we do for oral hygiene.So yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B\'s Vitality.  That\'s just your teeth and gums howling like Westley from The Princess Bride being tortured.  Well, your teeth and gums are wimps.  They\'ll get used to it and thank you later.  Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you\'ve just had a professional cleaning.  The secret, of course is the much-vaunted circular buffing motion.  You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  Problem solved.  Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there\'s not a lot to complain about.  If you\'ve got the bucks and a hankering for oral hygiene, then you could surely do worse than to invest in Vitality."

It is the perfect size for travel.On the negative side are the following:(1) The brush quality.  The brush quality is on-par with my earlier Oral B brush (which now retails for around $35).  Additionally, the brush head is more traditional and I tend to favor the rounded head found on most Oral B brushes.(2) The charging station.  Not nearly the high quality that I would expect.

When hubby asked for whitening toothpaste, I noticed that we were both experiencing staining, something that hasn\'t happened since we\'ve owned a power brush.  Thanks to lots of coffee and tea, I can *see* ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health.  Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth are back to normal now.I would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).

Clearly they got the source of the stain wrong, and I\'m not so sure about the brush.My research led to the purchase of the Oral-B 3000.Oral-B and Sonicare seem the brushes of choice, and my research gave Oral-B a slight edge, though I\'m reconsidering. Reading reviews also gave the Oral-B floss action brush head a slight edge, and I\'m inclined to agree; though it certainly doesn\'t replace regular flossing, so far it seems to be keeping the staining abated.The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist\'s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. Primarily, the mode switch is a source of frustration, for the brush can not be shut off without going through all three modes. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000."

The toothbrush comes with a charger and clock/timer for each of your cleaning sessions. This not only monitors how long you are cleaning, but, has a little red light that is illuminated when you are brushing too hard. What\'s more, once you have reached the two minute mark, a smiley face appears on the digital timer. So helpful! I look forward to following up with my dentist in six months, to track my progress.

It does not use a lot of space in your bathroom.When I first used this power toothbrush it felt somewhat large, but then quickly it felt comfortable. I have been using an ultrasonic toothbrush for some time now with great results so far. What i really liked about this one is that you feel the head much more on your teeth and you feel the movement, so you end up with a feeling of having really clean mouth which I like much more than the ultrasonic.Another advantage for this one is that there are different types of heads for different uses, and they are considerably less expensive than the replacement heads for ultrasonic toothbrushes (which are almost as expensive as this brush is). I have been using my power brush for about two months, alternating with the ultrasonic, and it has worked perfectly.Overall, a pretty good power brush. For the price, this is an unbeatable value."

Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but the Pulsonic leaves me a bit unsure.The design of this brush is very reminiscent of the Sonicare toothbrushes, right down to the stand which always looked different on all the previous Oral-B electric brushes. This design really looks like a stripped-down baby version of the Sonicare.First of, the brush itself is extremely slim and light-weight for an electric brush. So much so that one wonders whether it can actually \'do the job\'. So after charging it the required 12 hours, I tried it out for the first time. I did not find it any different in power than the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, it felt the same.What is different is that the Pulsonic\'s manual instructs the user to move the brush over the teeth in a circular motion, very much like one is supposed to do with a manual brush. I, for one, didn\'t quite like this although I can see the benefit of doing it this way. The Pulsonic has - like the Sonicare and unlike the Oral-B Triumph - a regular (yet contoured) brush head. The shape of such a brush head makes it difficult  to sufficiently cover the entire tooth. One is always either cleaning along the gumline or more towards the bite. Using circular motion prevents that only parts of the teeth are cleaned. Yet - I have been using electric toothbrushes for so long that I have gotten used to not really having to do anything but hold the brush head to the teeth. So this is a change I am not sure I like too much.Also - these rectangular brush heads don\'t seem to work too well for me personally. I have a small mouth and find it difficult to easily brush my teeth with these brush heads, especially the insides of the front teeth. It always feels as if I can\'t quite reach all the surfaces, especially the areas along the gumline, and that leaves me wondering whether I get as complete a cleaning as I should be getting.Philips has tried to address this problem by offering a smaller brush head for the Sonicare, but Oral-B doesn\'t seem to have that. So this is not optimal for me.What I did like about the Pulsonic though is that it comes with a second \'Precision Tip\' brush head. I found this to be a great way to really get into the spaces between teeth and I give Oral-B a big thumbs-up for this one.Lastly, the Pulsonic, like the other models and brands, informs the user audibly when it is time to change to a different \'quadrant\' to be brushed, and when the two minutes recommended brush time are over.All in all this is probably a brush I will take along when travelling - the light weight but equal power output make it perfect for that, but at home I will likely stay with the Oral-B Triumph and its round brush heads. I just feel that these heads reach all areas of my teeth better and also feel more comfortable on the sensitive areas of my mouth."

Now to the point...- Quality of the cleaning - My first impression is that the feeling it leaves after you use the brush is slick and clean.  Im usually the type to brush when I can and I do religiously.  I feel this product does the job well and faster than using a manual toothbrush.- Charge - The charge last pretty much exactly what it says.  Depending how often you use it (I use mine twice-morning and night) It lasts about 10-14 days.- Timer -The quadrant timer is something that is useful as well.  I like how it \'paces\' you through the brushing.  There are times when my mind wanders and with this it gives a little pause in the vibrations to prompt you to go to the next quadrant in your mouth.- Durability -Its been about 5 or 6 months since I\'ve purchased it and it doesnt seem to have any durability issues.  When spending any more money for a high dollar item this is a concern for me.- Sound - The sound is a little bit louder than the Sonicare, but it wasn\'t a big concern for me.Overall, it was a choice between this and the Sonicare line, and I went with this after lots of research.  I like how this comes with a nice travel case so for the trips it is easy to store.  Many of the Sonicare products that is in the same price range did not.  Also the replacement heads for the brush are cheaper with the Oral B (more options to pick also)and it might not be a big deal to everyone, but I\'m sure the cost all adds up after years of use.  With all that aside, I\'m very happy with the product, because of the quality of cleaning. It says 2 minutes for a total clean, but I go the 2 minutes plus an extra 45-60 seconds and I get a better clean than manually brushing for 5 minutes plus.  I never had a \'break in\' time to have my gums adjust, which some people might need, but it was fine and gentle enough for me.  Ill never go back to manual toothbrushes again."

It feels much cleaner, and although i didn\'t believe it at first, my teeth are getting white because the brush is lifting the stains out. I decided to purchase this brush and not a Sonic Care because 1. There was a 50% off rebate for this and 2. I have a small mouth, so the brush head was perfect for me. I love the brush heads, there are so many offered, and i can find them at most, if not all drug stores. I was hesitant at first on purchasing this, but i thought about the investment and teeth so i have no regrets. Although this brush sounds like it will jack hammer your gums and teeth away, i got used to it pretty fast. My gums did bleed a bit, but that was expected. Now they look and feel much healthier. Although i thought the smart guide was just a little \'buy me i\'m unnecessary\' kind of device, i find it pretty helpful especially for a first time user like myself.

I would recommend it as an entry-level electric toothbrush to those who are too unsure about the technology to pay for one of the more higher priced models.Full disclosure: I received this toothbrush free as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, at the low cost of $29.99 I probably would\'ve bought it anyway. I think it is definitely worth that price for a first-time electric toothbrush.PROSCLEANING: My teeth get much cleaner when I use this toothbrush versus my traditional one. They feel smooth, just like I came from the dentist. Flossing also seems easier while using this toothbrush because, with the right tilt on the brush, it is better able to clean between my teeth and at the gum line, so there seems to be less tartar buildup when I floss.WHITENING: The stain removal is EXCELLENT. My teeth are not that stained, but during the 2 weeks I\'ve been using this brush, I\'ve noticed a *significant* decrease in the yellow stains near my gum line.BATTERY: This may sound odd, but I liked the way the battery ran out. I was a bit concerned about what would happen and how I would handle it (the instructions give no clue). It pretty much just stops working, no wind-down at all. I liked that because it left no mystery as to \'will it or won\'t it\' finish and I just finished brushing my teeth with it manually. I\'ve used this toothbrush 1-2 times per day for over 2 weeks now, and I\'ve only had to charge it once.REPLACEMENTS: The brush indicates when it needs to be replaced via color loss on the bristles (just like some traditional toothbrushes do). It does come with an extra head, as well as a $3 coupon for another one.CONSDROPLETS: The only negative on this toothbrush is probably just due to my inexperience with electric toothbrushes: it sprays toothpaste droplets onto my clothing. Now I try to brush my teeth before I dress, or else I drape a hand towel over my blouse while brushing.VIBRATIONS: As others have mentioned, the vibrations are INCREDIBLY strong on this toothbrush. You should NOT press it hard against your teeth; just lay it gently onto them and let the brush do the work for you. My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive (I have several cracked ones) and once I stopped pressing with the brush, I had no problems with pain due to the vibrations. However, the vibrations DO make my nose ticklish.Unlike other reviewers, I have NOT experienced any \'gunk\' buildup in the toothbrush stand because I always rinse off my toothbrush the way the instructions say to. (If you put ANY toothbrush back in its holder without rinsing it well enough, you\'re going to get \'gunk.\')Overall, I would recommend this as a fine first electric toothbrush, especially at this price point."

I visit my dentist every 6 months without fail (yes I have dental insurance and bi-annual cleanings are covered) and I have received nothing but praise from my dentist.I recently switched to this model becauser I became incredibly frustrated with the internal battery models dying 12 to 18 months after purchase. This was not due to mechanical failure as the build quality of this Made in Germany product is solid. However the Ni-Cad batteries cannot sustain charges well after prolonged use. I always disassemble the old brushes, remove the AA battery, and run it through a La Crosse charger using the full charge-discharge cycle which brings the battery back to life. However the disassembly of the brush does not permit for its reconstruction so all I am left with is a rechargeable AA Ni-Cad battery for use in other devices.The great thing about this brush is that it has the same great build quality but costs half the price. Additionally, it takes two AA batteries and the unit goes a week worth of brushing without charging while the internal battery models get 3 days maximum when new which slowly falls to every day before needing charging.In short, you get the same cleaning efficacy at half the cost with extended periods between charges. I am hoping that the product\'s life will also extend beyond 18 months further enhancing the benefits of this model versus any Oral-B/Braun model that can cost 10 times as much!! Seems like a real winner and a no-brainer."

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  The number after the dash (for example EB17-3) just means how many toothbrush heads you\'ll be receiving.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads."

I always want to have good teeth for aesthetic reasons, and also because my mom invested so much in my teeth even though paying for braces twice wasn\'t so easy for her. I figure it\'s the least I can do, considering what she did for me.I have been wanting a rechargeable toothbrush for a long time, and I wanted the best I could buy in the Oral B line. I kind of thought that $100 was pretty high for a toothbrush, but they are offering the 50% rebate right now. When I get the rebate check, I\'ll really only have $50 in it. And that\'s not a bad price for a product that helps you keep your mouth healthier. I would have eventually bought this toothbrush at full price without a rebate, but the 50% rebate really pushed me to go ahead and buy it now.I got my toothbrush about 4 days ago, and I absolutely love it so far. I feel like it does a much better job than a manual toothbrush ever could. I\'ve been brushing in the Deep Clean mode, which is 3 minutes. Sometimes I even continue brushing for a minute or two after the 3 minutes on the Smart Guide has passed. My teeth feel so smooth when I\'m finished brushing; it\'s amazing.I love the Smart Guide that comes with this toothbrush. The timer really helps you see how long to brush in each quadrant before moving on to the next. I feel like I\'m getting a professional cleaning at home.I read a lot of reviews on here before making my purchase, which was very helpful. I did read a few reviews where people had said they experienced some bleeding from their gums, but I haven\'t had any trouble with that at all.So far, I\'m thrilled with this toothbrush and hope it continues to impress me. My twice yearly dental cleanings/checkups are always great, but I\'m really anxious for my next visit to see if the hygienist notices less plaque buildup, etc.If you\'re thinking about a rechargeable toothbrush, this is an excellent choice.

The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.  I bought this second one in 9/2010 while Amazon & OralB had a 50% off rebate so ended up paying only $25 for it - a definite buy at that price!

My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why. Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:- practically no assembly required, it\'s ready to go out of the box- comes with a deck for the charger and slots for 4 heads. Storing the head keeps it cleaner, and you can use this brush for the entire family - just get different color heads and you\'re set.- all you have to do is move the brush around, no pressure needed. In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.- the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles- I love how sensitive the power button is. With CrossAction, I had to jam the button to get the brush going. With the 3000, you literally just tap it.- the brush takes about 17 hours to charge fully, and last for a week. However, I just keep it on the charger all the time since you can\'t overcharge it.The only thing that I\'m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space.

It\'s almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money.

It was only when I sought out a remedy and came across studies linking SLS -- sodium lauryl sulfate -- as a major contributor to canker sore outbreaks that I discovered this amazing toothpaste. I have used this toothpaste since it came out on the market and my incidence of outbreaks has diminished nearly 100%. If I do happen to get an outbreak, which will happen if I do not brush at least three times per day, the intensity of the outbreak is significantly reduced and the amount of time the canker sore lasts is only a few days. If you suffer from canker sores to any degree BUY THIS TOOTHPASTE! You will never suffer again. I turned my aunt, my uncle and now my husband onto this toothpaste and they are now canker sore free as well."

I just love it. It was easy to set up even for me not a gadget freak. It has a timer and action in the brush to let you know when to stop brushing. The brush heads will set you back, but you can find them on sale as well as cheaper generic versions. One caution, do not use an electric toothbrush more than twice a day and do not use much over the recommended two minutes otherwise you risk scratching the enamel on your teeth, not a good thing to do. I keep my manual garden variety brush on hand for brushing between meals and for air travel.

Well, my brushing habits and checkups slipped over the years and that left me with alot of bad teeth and plaque buildup.I now get regular dental care and try my best to keep my teeth looking their best. that\'s where this product comes into play.the design is wonderful. simply place toothpaste on the replaceable head and brush all your teeth including your gumline. you will get the feeling that you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. this gets deep into every nook and cranny of your mouth. it really works and stregthens your gums, and if you floss regularly your gums will no longer bleed when brushing.battery life is mediocre, sometimes lasting a a month or longer depending on frequency of use. i use mine roughly 3 times a day and i get about 5 weeks out of  a standard raovac AA battery. which to me, is acceptable.don\'t not press down to hard when brushing, this will cause the head to wear out faster than need be, and it will fray very easily if you use alot of pressure. just go ahead put some toothpaste on the head and play your favorite 3 minute song, and you will be on your way to better oral health. the benefits from switching from manual toothbrushes to this one have been enormous! my dentist actually commented on how clean my teeth were.this is a cheaper alternative to paying 60, 70, or 80 bucks for the higher end models. replacement heads are a little more expensive than normal manual toothbrushes but having cleaner teeth was a sacrifice i was willing to make.an overall great product. good alternative to more expensive brands. way to go oral b!"

I love that it times the brushing for you, 30 seconds per quadrant, so you do a thorough job.  Last week I went back to the dentist for my 6-month followup, now 9 months pregnant, and anticipating the worst - but it was the best check up I\'ve ever had.  The cleaning was a breeze - I had hardly any buildup and everything looked great.

Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price. So I asked myself, \'How bad can they be\'?The brush heads I received looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense). When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example. On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth). These brush heads have very poor motion constraint. The circular brush can easily \'slide\' around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).Not only that, but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing. As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \'knock-off\', more interested in looking like the original than acting like it.My advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads.

Overall, we are both very satisfied with this product.Product Details and background for my review--------------------------------------------I have owned Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  I have owned a previous generation of Oral-B electric brush some years ago and found the build quality was poor when compared to Sonicare. Sonicare employs a rapid vibration of the brush head to generate sonic waves which dislodge plaque from teeth.  The Oral-B brush has a small, round head that rotates back and forth (It does not do full rotations.  If I had to guess about how much it rotates before it switches directions, I would guess somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees).  The package says that in clinical studies it improves gum health better than Sonicare advance.  I cannot provide feedback on this as I have not been to the dentist since I have been using the Oral-B and even if I had been, the results of that visit would not be guaranteed to be related to the brush itself.THE GOOD--------This toothbrush is very well constructed.  This new model has excellent build quality throughout.My teeth feel smoother after using the Oral-B than after using my Sonicare.  I thought I was imagining it and didn\'t mention it to my wife but when she approached me telling me her teeth feel cleaner and smoother, I was convinced that the mechanical performance of the brush was better at cleaning the teeth.  So far the battery performance is very good but it is a new brush so I expect it to be so.  It has a pacing mode similar to Sonicare\'s in that it gives the user feedback every 30 seconds (the brush head stops moving momentarily.  Sonicare beeps in this case, but I don\'t think this is a plus or minus for either brush).  I did like that the Oral-B will let you go beyond the 2 minutes (30 seconds for each quadrant of the mouth).  The Sonicare makes you start it again as it shuts off after 2 minutes.  I brush my teeth for 2 minutes and then brush my tongue so I find the fact that the Oral-B continues to run after 2 minutes is a plus.  The brush heads are cheaper than Sonicare and they have different kinds (basic cleaning, floss action -- which has little rubber floss picks in the head).  This brush gives you feedback when you press too hard.  My Sonicare Elite does not do this.  Cleanup is \'slightly\' more difficult with the Oral-B but the way the head connects is better making overall cleanup much better.  The Sonicare has a deep plastic well that houses the magnets that cause the pulsing.  Liquids (water, saliva, toothpaste) can get in there and it is not easy to get it out fully, even with a Q-tip.  Over time, this can cause mildew, so I have had to use a q-tip in alcohol to solve this.  The way the Oral-B is designed, this would never happen, you just remove the head, rinse it and give the brush a quick wipe on a towel.  The design is very good and supports easy cleanup.  I hesitate to put the wireless remote brush monitor in the \'Good\' category, as I don\'t like it, but some people who are really gadget-heads might enjoy this.  Basically it is a small LCD display that shows you where you are in the brushing cycle and gives you a visual cue when you\'re brushing too hard.  The brush itself gives you this feedback though, so I think this wireless thing is kind of \'hokey\' and when the batteries die, I\'ll likely toss it in the box and throw it under the stairs.  The good thing about it is that both my wife\'s brush and mine connect to a single wireless display without \'pairing\'.  I haven\'t tried to use it at the exact same time as her, but this obviously would not work.  It has tiny integrated legs so that you can lay it down on its side without it rolling away.THE BAD-------There is a \'mode\' button that lets you cycle through the five brushing modes.  It is right where I naturally want to put my thumb so I have had to train myself to put my thumb elsewhere so I don\'t keep changing modes while I brush.  It is much louder than my Sonicare  The Sonicare works by a magnet turning on and off rapidly so there is no connection between the brush head and the \'motor\'... In the Oral-B, there is basically a tiny axle that connects the motor to the brush head.  This is inherently noisier than the Sonicare design.  I don\'t find it terrible though.  I do not find the wireless lcd display to be useful.  Everything it provides can (and is) provided by feedback in the toothbrush itself.  The wireless lcd display is just another thing to clutter your bathroom vanity.  With that said, the pricing does not make it feel as if I paid extra for the lcd display so I am not too concerned about it.THE UGLY--------Nothing about this toothbrush was terribleOther things to considerThe brush has various modes (high speed, lower speed, one that slowly goes from gentle to vigorous and back, one that pulses, etc.  I believe there are 5 such modes).  I do not use them because my gums and teeth are not sensitive so I use the vigorous mode full-time but maybe somebody with sensitive gums would want the pulsing mode so they could have some gum stimulation without over-doing it."
