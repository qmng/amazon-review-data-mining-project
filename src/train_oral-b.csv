1576,1614,20081213,B001CX4JSS,1,"December 13, 2008",A28PS4EHKFNDE4,Proctor & Gamble Sucks,I purchased this toothbrush thru Amazon.com. On the Amazon website was a link to a rebate stating send in proof of purchase and you will receive a $15 rebate check.  Well I printed out the coupon and sent it in with my Amazon.com receipt when it arrived. It stated the price I paid etc and was the receipt. There was no other receipt.Yesterday I received something in the mail from P&G that it did not meet their proof-of-purchase status and I needed some UPC code. Where was this? Wasn\'t it on the receipt??? I am being given 7 days to reply and they include a website if you have questions. Well the website is obsolete. What to do???This is the worst customer service I have ever received and I will never buy another P&G product as long as I live.Let them go down with Big Auto. SHAME ON YOU P&G. This is why America is losing its edge.

2160,2210,20110302,B002HWS9GG,4,"March 2, 2011",A2JCNIN1RNRCQI,Three Years of Professional Care Toothbrushes - Pretty Good,"My husband and I have owned three of these Oral-B \'Professional Care\' toothbrushes within three years: a Triumph 9400 (3 years), a Triumph 9900 (2 years), and a SmartSeries 5000.  Despite the name change from \'Triumph\' to \'SmartSeries,\' there are no differences except for the charger-toothbrush-holding-stand, which has changed from a tall rounded design (which was a pain to assemble and disassemble) to a elongated flattened rectangle.  In fact, if you look at the handle of your SmartSeries 5000, it says, \'Triumph.\'  All of these toothbrushes are the same design, except the 9400 doesn\'t interface with the SmartSeries clock.I have noticed that the price point has stayed similar over the years, and now Oral-B is consistently including the \'SmartGuide,\' which is a little clock-like contraption that gives signals (e.g., time, time of brush, too much pressure, etc.).  This toothbrush is convenient and does a pretty good job of keeping your teeth much cleaner and whiter than manual brushing.  My dentist doesn\'t scold me as much during cleanings any more.One caveat: My husband\'s Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries) had a bearing go out within six months of normal use.  The SmartSeries clock would flash the \'red triangle\' (brushing with too much pressure) caution and the toothbrush would buzz uncomfortably throughout the brushing process.  Although the toothbrush originally cost us around $149, we couldn\'t find the original sales receipt in order to claim the warranty.  Finally, after complaining about it for a year-and-a-half, we accepted the hit to the pocketbook and replaced his malfunctioning Triumph 9900 with the SmartSeries 5000... which was surprisingly the same toothbrush despite the name change.In short:- The price at MSRP is the equivalent of 30 regular toothbrushes, but it does a very good job when it works- This toothbrush is a good buy from Amazon due to significant price decrease (major retailers are still selling it at MSRP)- The SmartSeries 5000 (with SmartSeries) is the same as the Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries)- Keep your receipt for potential warranty issues! Better to be safe than sorry, and $160 poorer due to replacement cost (like us)- 10 hours to fully charge, about 10 days of charge at 2x brushings/day- Standalone charger is convenient to detach from brush-holder for extra counter room or to take on trips"

The only issue I could say is that the handle itself feels rather bulky for what it is, but that is not really a big drawback."

The 6-packs available here are about the same price as the 3-packs at the big box stores.  Purchasing them here is a no-brainer!"

That I needed something electric or battery operated to clean my teeth instead of the plain old toothbrush.2.  That something this inexpensive would work well enough to justify paying the extra over a plain old toothbrush.My husband gave his a go first and said, \'I don\'t want to sway your decision, you go use yours.\'I took that to mean he wasn\'t very impressed and proceeded to brush my teeth.I was VERY impressed (and so was he).*My teeth felt incredibly cleaner than they do with a plain old toothbrush.*The brush does the scrubbing for you and if you are applying too much pressure you can hear it in the motor.*It comes with a brush cover so you can take it with you traveling easily.*No recharger to clutter the counter (also making it easier to take on trips)This cross action toothbrush is fantastic and a fantastic price!"

2335,2389,20101019,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 19, 2010",ARVE75V751MJ8,I\'ll never go back to Sonicare!,"I debated a long time over this toothbrush or the latest Sonicare, but I am so happy I chose the Oral-B! My old Sonicare Elite was a good introduction to electric toothbrushes, but after 2 years I was tired of not being able to keep it clean. The Oral-B is very easy to clean and eliminates all possibilities for \'gunk build-up\'!!Plus, my mouth has never felt so clean! It is like having a dentist brush and floss your teeth, but not painful.A+ on this toothbrush!"
1236,1264,20120425,B000LSUW6S,5,"April 25, 2012",A25ZO2MF0WG9Z1,toothbrushes,I got these toothbrush heads for my Dad. He could not find them in any store near his area and really liked the brush. I am a dental hygienist and could plainly see that he was in need of new brush heads. So far he is very happy with the purchase and I was glad I was able to find them for him.Thank you very much.
508,519,20120503,B0002KHU3I,5,"May 3, 2012",A1VV9N0V67M6CU,"Right heads, Amazing price",Bought these for my Oral B toothbrush at an amazing price from amazon [with their $5 coupon]. They work extremely well. Was surprised to find that they are made in Germany [not China]!
492,503,20080909,B0002KHTG6,1,"September 9, 2008",A30MHF93BGHOFU,Does not function as designed.,The yellow silicon cup in the center is designed to hold toothpaste just like dentists use a similar tool to hold a granular paste to polish your teeth. Nice idea but regular toothpaste just desolves as soon as you begin to brush. I recommend the Dual Action or the Floss Action versions instead.
2735,2807,20110816,B003UKKHB4,4,"August 16, 2011",A1QF20V9YQ3T3K,Good brush for a good price,"I really like this brush for a few different reasons. First, there are 3 speeds.  While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  My last toothbrush had a tiny LED screen built into the brush that displayed battery life.  However, after about a year, this screen shorted out and became useless. The unit eventually just gave out and I had to replace it.I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard. I wish I actually had this feature years ago because I was brushing too hard and scrubbed away much of my enamel.It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  There are better brushes for you gums.  However, if I could give half stars, I would give this unit a 4.5/5 star rating.Oral-B was also running a promo at the time; if you buy an qualifying unit, you can receive an 50% mail in rebate.  So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  So for $40, this is a great brush.  This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard no matter which unit/brand you buy. I also like that it takes up a small amount of space on my countertop; I wish the power cord was detachable for easier storage though - not a big deal however.All in all, it is a good brush.  It is a straightforward unit that has just the right amount of features without paying an arm and a leg."
2636,2700,20101209,B003UKKHB4,4,"December 9, 2010",A29FOQUE7DCQQC,Pretty cool,System has several settings and it alsolets you know if you are brushing too hard.  Only confusing part is the programs are accessed by pressing the on-off switch and doesn\'t automatically turn off after 2 minutes so you need to tell the 30 second interval notification from the 2 minute notification
793,810,20111125,B0002M5JO8,5,"November 25, 2011",A39OHY2CHDNJEL,hard to find,"After driving all over town and wasting time looking for replacement brushes at the wholesale clubs, big box stores, and local drug stores I decided to check Amazon. Viola! Three days later I had my much needed brushes and the shipping was FREE. I should have checked Amazon FIRST! I have used this Oral B Vitality Sonic brush for years and really like it. I don\'t know why retailers are no longer stocking the replacements."
1685,1728,20110702,B001FWXT4Q,5,"July 2, 2011",A21VCPE6T2SA3Z,Great tool!,I cannot find these anywhere locally.  My dental hygenist got me started on this tool for getting into hard places in your teeth.  This works.  My gums have improved at my check-ups so it is well worth using every day!
2172,2222,20110217,B002HWS9GG,5,"February 17, 2011",A32JOIE3JEYMXF,Love at first use!!,"I\'ve had my Oral B electric toothbrush for only THREE days and noticed instantly how well it cleans my teeth (did I mention I got it from my orthodontist because I have just started wearing braces at age 53?), I didn\'t think so!  I am very particular with my teeth and thought the braces would drive me crazy, but must say I\'m able to keep them cleaner than before with this toothbrush.  I got online to check it out because I plan to buy my daughter and husband one."
1819,1864,20120427,B002HWS9FW,5,"April 27, 2012",A1CVD29D8YCTA4,After two minute a signal to stop,"I have been using Oral B for over 10 years. No research was necessary for this purchase. What is interesting about this one is that it tells me when to stop brushing, after two minutes it sends a pulsed signal that you are done, convenient and very useful. I recently purchase one more.I prefer the replaceable battery to the rechargeable units, the battery version last much longer and I consider it more convenient on trips not to carry a charger particularly on foreign trips."

I didn\'t think I would like the \'pulsonic\' action as well as the old standby, but I was wrong... it\'s sooo much nicer!  Just about as effortless as brushing your teeth can get.  It is slim and light, but you really feel like you got your teeth clean after two minutes with this baby!  Great brush!"
38,39,20081221,B00006ANDJ,4,"December 21, 2008",A349KEZKRGCP46,Works fine.,"These  replacement brush heads seem to work fine. Very similar to past items. Arrived as advertised.I\'m curious about the more advanced versions which claim to surround each tooth and provide a flossing action, but didn\'t get them this time."

It is more like the size of a regular toothbrush. Dose not seem to be of the quality as the sonicare either; but only time will tell. Good price.

Great product!I\'ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in it\'s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I\'ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don\'t know what they\'re talking about. I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down. Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.Don\'t hesitate to purchase a Pulsonic. But shop around for replacement heads. I found there\'s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive. However, this Pulsonic has two speeds, and she has found the slower speed to be perfect for her.Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he\'s happy with it too. The size works well with a smaller mouth.Pros-cleans greatlight weightsmall sizeworks for small mouths, i.e. childrenmaneuverablelong battery life (between charge)reasonable priceCons-None so far"

Previously, I never spent more than $5 max for a toothbrush because \'they all do the same thing\'. Boy was I wrong! I got braces in April of this year (2011) so I had to invest in something that would really clean my teeth. I use this along with the Waterpik. I couldn\'t afford to spend a million dollars on some of the other electric brushes with the *fancy* features. I think this is just as good. My teeth are whiter and my breath is fresher (too much info, I know). But it\'s true. I love the 2 minute timer as well. If this is your first time purchasing an electric toothbrush, this is a great start. I even bought another one to have in my purse!"

We have used the same electric toothbrush for many years. Have tried others & they do not feel right in our mouths.  I am so glad to find that Amazon.com is the place to get these toothbrush heads.

I feel the Floss action is a waste of money, just a way to get a little more out your pocket to brush less."
1955,2000,20111028,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 28, 2011",A1K8V81GXTKN7G,For once I am excited about brushing,"I did not get that \'morning & night\' toothbrush routine instilled into me, so I thought this toothbrush would help. It also helped at the time that there was a 50% rebate from Oral-B (which was received in 3 weeks, not bad for a rebate). So for one, it was a good deal at a post-rebate of $54.99.This was a perfect set-up for my husband and me. It came with a floss head and I already had a whitening brush head. When we unpacked, we set it up next to the counter plug (I don\'t like to have wires spread everywhere) and placed the timer on the mirror at my eye level.The timer shows a round diagram (to represent your mouth) and it times 30 seconds a section. Then you get a big smile and a wink for the time after 2 minutes. The timer display also shows what mode you are like normal or gentle and if you are brushing too hard.The brush has been working well for both my husband and I. The brush does make noise, and since there is not doorseparating our sink from the bedroom, I do have to go into the enclosed toilet/ bathtub room to brush when my husband is sleeping. Also, there is only one brush so you either have to brush one after another or use another oral-B professional brush, which we already had (the Professional 1000).My husband dentist thanked him for flossing (which he doesn\'t), and my dentist said that my gums looked a lot healthier and my teeth were very white. My dentist even is going to order me 2 new brush heads every time I come in (about every 6 months) instead of the standard toothbrush.I would recommend this brush to everyone. I know that all can\'t afford them, so I tell them to watch for rebates, when you can get them cheap. They save you at the dentist (with less cavities). To get my white fillings, it cost more than this toothbrush, retail."
2763,2836,20120419,B003UKM90Q,5,"April 19, 2012",A2JP8WY5XGPJX6,Product Recommended by my Dentist,I have never owned an electric tooth brush.  Just seemed sort of silly to let the toothbrush do the work for me.  My dentist then recommended I get one and said the cleaning is far superior to the \'old fashioned\' way.  She said that I didn\'t need to get the top of the line with all of the bells and whistles - just get the Vitality.  I got it and I really like it.  Just leaves my mouth feeling cleaner.
2238,2290,20101212,B002HWS9GG,5,"December 12, 2010",A15C02P1KW95Y8,great product!,"I received this toothbrush a month ago and can\'t be happier. I used to have the basic Oral B and thought that was perfect, specially because I thought it was crazy to spend so much money in a toothbrush. Turned out I needed a new toothbrush and saw that the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 came with a $50 rebate so I decided to get it. I am so happy I did... You can tell the difference right away between a basic toothbrush and this one. For one thing, it has so many features that the basic doesn\'t have and you can tell the difference in your teeth. The motor is much more powerful and leaves your eeth feeling great. You have different modes to brush your teeth and the little timer helps you keep track on how long you have to brush your teeth. I just got my $50 back and it\'s been such a worth purchase. I definitely recommend this product to anyone!"

I also purchased one for myself and have been completely satisfied.  It\'s much quieter that my last Oral B toothbrush.  Oral B makes a really good product!
2640,2704,20101127,B003UKKHB4,5,"November 27, 2010",A140FKZ6NPM5QE,Excellent Toothbrush,Bought this toothbrush after reading the great reviews on Amazon and am quite pleased with my purchase.This toothbrush replaces a 12-year-old Sonicare. I was truly sad when the poor ol\' guy bit the dust. After a week without an electric toothbrush I realized I needed to get another and researched Sonicare vs. OralB/Braun. I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn\'t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 & 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I\'m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn\'t expecting that big of a difference.The only thing I don\'t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn\'t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn\'t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.

It has a long-lasting rechargeable battery, which charges whenever not in use, and does a great job on teeth with a head that is shaped for hard-to-reach areas.  But the best part of this brush is the little timer that has some kind of remote signal.  It is a clock when not in use (and gives the correct time) then becomes a timer when you start to brush.  I can walk out of the room, even, and it continues to time me.  Dentists recommend brushing at least two minutes - and you get a little smiley face when you hit two minutes, or a big smiley face (sometimes a wink) if you brush for 2:30.  My kids want one ot these now, too, but I\'d say it\'s a bit too powerful for kids.  It\'s a great buy and, while it costs way more than a standard toothbrush, it holds up beautifully and works hard.  It also comes with a carrying case for travel, which I love because power toothbrushes never fit into standard cases.  The battery charge lasts two days off the charger, so you can go away for the weekend without carrying all the gear. Love it."

I heard that Oral-B was doing a 50% rebate promotion so I decided it was time for an upgrade.  I chose the 3000 model, and I am very pleased with the purchase.  The toothbrush has a vigorous action, and my teeth feel dentist visit clean after I brush.  The 30 second timer is a nice feature that allows you to spend that amount of brushing time on the four quadrants of the mouth. The 2 minute timer lets you know that the morning/evening ritual is complete.  The storage lid hides the brush heads when not in use, and is a feature that my wife appreciates.  The one negative comment I have is that the package only comes with one brush head, but I suppose that the nice rebate more than fairly offsets the cost of additional heads."

The floss action feels like it cleans around the gum well, but does not replace flossing.  It does not get between teeth, but it does a good job of working around the gums.  Not too rough, but you know that something is happening."

It is more complicated, complete with wireless monitor, to the point where you have to sit and read the instructions a few times to understand what it\'s all about.  Once you get past all that and just start using it, it\'s pretty simple and it does a great job, much better than the old \'plug and push\' model I had before.  I could tell the difference in one brushing, and the \'smart\' stuff doesn\'t get in the way.  The slight pause after every 30 seconds of brushing, when you\'re supposed to move to another 1/4 of your mouth, is a bit annoying, but other than that it\'s pretty good."

The only thing I will add to what has been said is that replacement brushes for Oral B cost about half of what you pay for Sonic Care.  So this brush doesn\'t cost any more up front, and the usage cost is lower.  Also, my brush came with a 50% rebate form! (which I haven\'t sent in, yet)"

I like the way it lets you know it\'s time to move to another part of you mouth so that you do all teeth equally. The only thing that could be better is placement of the on/off button. It blends in really well with the rest of the handle so you can barely feel it to turn it off.

So I was curious to see what all the fuss was about.It certainly is easy to set up, and after 17 hours of battery charging, a simple task to operate.I must say though that it takes a little getting used to, for those of us old-time \'toothbrushers\'.  But after adjusting to the weird feel of something electrical in contact with the moisture in your mouth, and the buzzing vibrating sensations on your teeth, it didn\'t take too long to get the hang of it.You still need to do some serious flossing, and ?I think this device might even be pushing some food particles into those post-molar crevices, so don\'t forget to use the Interdental brush and floss in there too.So far, it seems like an easy modern way to ensure basic dental hygiene, and I\'m satisfied with the results.  I\'ve had no problems with breaking brush heads or any of the other disasters mentioned in some of the older models\' reviews that I read.Recommended."

I like that it\'s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison.  On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare.  And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general. (I also have their Pulsonic razor)  I also like the design of the charging unit and extra cleaning attachment as well.But as I said earlier, I switched from Sonicare to an Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.  And for me, comparing this Pulsonic to the Triumph... well, there\'s just no comparison.  The Triumph is better by far.  Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you\'re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.I\'ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it\'s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won\'t last long.  I can bring my Triumph on a 10 day vacation without the charging unit (and I brush twice a day.)  I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn\'t have a big enough battery to do that.  And even if it does, that just goes to show you the cleaning power.  This one is subtle, and good if you have sensitive teeth and gums.So if you want a good, deep clean, buy the Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide."

When you brush you keep the mouth semi-closed and the brush in contact with your teeth at the border with your gums, without pushing too much. This smaller brush allows you to get all around the molars as well. She did not specify the brand but she did say that it is not a matter of price, it is all about how you use it. So you don\'t really need an expensive one. I bought this one because it gets great reviews and the price is very good. I love it! My gums are way better now and she very impressed (well...and I am very impressed as well!). When I went on vacation I brought the regular toothbrush and after a couple of days my gums were all inflamed again. I can\'t leave without it!

2975,3056,20101113,B003UKR67M,2,"November 13, 2010",A13700AF4X40YG,Small Step Up from Manual Toothbrush,"I got this toothbrush thinking it might be a less expensive alternative to the more expensive sonic toothbrushes that I\'ve been using.  While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I\'m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn\'t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don\'t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I\'d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I\'ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I\'m not a dental health professional, so I don\'t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn\'t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it\'s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can\'t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I\'m afraid I don\'t care for it enough to do even that).If you\'re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I\'ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn\'t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums."

It works for me and I have noticed a difference after a month of usage.But again, as other have noted, it does irritate the gum line. The floss heads are a little rough along the gums, sometimes causing a bit of bleeding if too much pressure and time is put to the gum areas. One simply has to be careful to not over-brush the gum line and all will be well with the rest of the mouth.The one star out of the five I took away for this review is because the brush has the problem with irritating gums, everything else is fine.The charging base is convenient, and the feel of the brush is solid.I recommend this product as a budget brush.

Finding a great toothbrush can be a chore with the seemingly infinite options. When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions. Let me say I will be sticking with this one. The bristles are firm and \'aggressive\', albeit a gentle aggressive if that makes sense, while soft making it less likely to brush away enamel and/or gums. This was key for me. Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line. The back of the head of the brush serves as a tongue cleaner. It is really a scraper, so it\'s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn\'t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it. I highly recommend this brush!"

The strength of the brushing on \'normal\' mode is certainly not gentle, but then again, that\'s what the \'sensitive\' mode is for. We always use the normal mode and we\'ve had no issues. The \'Floss Action\' heads seem to work quite well to remove some of the inter-dental debris, but flossing is still necessary.We were a little skeptical about the SmartGuide, but since buying this toothbrush was part of our plan to improve dental hygiene, we decided to give it a shot. We mounted it on the bathroom wall next to the mirror. The thing quickly detects when you start brushing and shows you a diagram and a timer, so you know how long you need to brush. The rest of the time, it\'s a handy clock! We actually really like it. It was worth spending a few extra bucks to get it.All in all, it was a great purchase and a huge step up from using a regular toothbrush. I would recommend it to anyone."

The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare\'s."

It\'s definitely ready more messy cleaning sessions.The charging stand is stable (doesn\'t move) and it\'s easy to seat the unit on it.Came with extra brush heads. Nice value.I\'ve had it for three months and zero issues with the motorized unit, charging stand, or brushes.I have had to changed the batteries for the timer (two AA\'s). I replaced the ones that came with it, with some Duracells; they should last longer.If it keeps working this well, it might make a great gift for family members.No issues with shipping; easier than driving to a local store."

After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can\'t see because it\'s inside the column. It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next day.The directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable. I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000% markup.I tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.Caveat emptor."

When we received this review copy of the Oral-B Vitality Floss-Action unit, we of course were comparing it against our Sonicare unit. So I\'ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea. It\'s now just a question of which one to get.In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh. We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it\'s doing a great job. It\'s not \'too mild\'. Our dentist praises us on how well our teeth are cared for. I don\'t see the need for the extra agitation this unit gives.There are no LEDs anywhere that we can see to indicate this unit is charging. It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn\'t being wasted.There\'s similarly no battery indicator.Finally, with the Sonicare, you get a blink every 30 seconds to change mouth quadrants. That way at the end of 2 minutes you know you\'ve handled each quadrant evenly. With this one, you solely get a buzz at the end of 2 minutes to tell you you\'re done. So you have to manage your time yourself. I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually - but there\'s many features they left out."

But, using this for about 2 weeks now, and i feel a HUGE difference from a manual brush and this. It feels much cleaner, and although i didn\'t believe it at first, my teeth are getting white because the brush is lifting the stains out. I decided to purchase this brush and not a Sonic Care because 1. There was a 50% off rebate for this and 2. I have a small mouth, so the brush head was perfect for me. I love the brush heads, there are so many offered, and i can find them at most, if not all drug stores. I was hesitant at first on purchasing this, but i thought about the investment and teeth so i have no regrets. Although this brush sounds like it will jack hammer your gums and teeth away, i got used to it pretty fast. My gums did bleed a bit, but that was expected. Now they look and feel much healthier. Although i thought the smart guide was just a little \'buy me i\'m unnecessary\' kind of device, i find it pretty helpful especially for a first time user like myself. It\'s cute, and pretty cool, i plan to keep using it. All in all, i love this product, and throwing down 1 bill, wasn\'t bad at all compared to the pros that will come out of all of this.

I have resisted this purchase for years, but it has become apparent that I really needed to get one.  Research indicated that this was the best brush as far as effectiveness.I\'m not all that excited about vibrating toothbrushes--reminds me a lot of going to the dentist.  But this really isn\'t so bad.  I was a little skeptical--but after feeling the \'dentist clean\' feeling, I was sold.  I love that the brush stops if i try to brush too hard.  the little display that shows the quadrants and how long you are brushing is a little helpful--although certainly not a selling feature in my book.  funny though, i found as did many reviewers, that this serves as a great bathroom clock!The information on amazon can be a bit confusing.  You get a travel case, charger, 2 brush tips (1 pro white and 1 floss), and the display.The handle is a bit on the large size and i\'m not sure it would be good for children.  I prefer smaller handles, however, they can\'t fit all that computer programming into a smaller handle.You do have to practice a bit at keeping your mouth closed enough that the toothbrush doesn\'t spray.  But it has never been a real issue for me--i would say any spray has been minimal.  And every electric toothbrush has this issue.I prefer the smaller brush head on these to the larger brush heads.  on normal toothbrushes I prefer full size brush heads--but when you have a large handle, it seems much more maneuverable to have the smaller head.  And it doesn\'t feel stranger or bother me--i adapted on first use.When you are done using, it is best to remove brush from handle and thoroughly run it under water.  This can prevent toothpaste from building up.Oral B has a 60 day try it guarantee and will refund your money if you are not happy.  That seems like a good deal."

The first time I have tried it, it felt a bit unpleasant, but I have gotten used to it very quickly. The best thing about this brush is the bigger brush head as compared to Oral-B Triumph. The brush allows you to use twice as much toothpaste (I have always been concerned that I was not using enough toothpaste with round Oral-B brushes), and it seems that it cleans teeth faster on flat surfaces. Getting into corners requires as much effort as with any other toothbrush.What I did not like: the charger is big and you cannot remove extra brush holders; to turn it off you have to push the power button twice (the first time it switches to sensitive mode); you are supposed to use it in a circular motion, and I tend not to be very good at it. In old days I had problems with traditional toothbrushes as I used to move them up and down and ended up scratching my teeth, so I am afraid this might happen with this brush as well. Finally, the description promises whiter teeth in two weeks, but I cannot see any difference."

Sometimes they lasted a while, but like other people have said they felt loose.  Then one by one, they would break, sometimes even while in my mouth.  I honestly thought it was just something wrong with my toothbruth.  I figured it was just a little off and causing damage to the heads.  So this weekend I began to look into buying a new toothbruth when I came across all the articles about the fake brushheads.  Sure enough, the descriptions of the fake merchandise matched what I had.  So I\'ve been using fake heads for a year.  I contacted Amazon and after 30 minutes and having to speak to the manager they refunded only the ones bought directly from Amazon.  They said since I had purchased them so long ago this was a \'special exception\' they were making for me.  I don\'t even really care about the money so much as I care about taking responsibility for it.  Amazon should be at least somewhere responsible for the quality of their products and even of the resellers.  Refunding or contacting the reseller is the least they can do in my opinion.  The manager has forwarded my story to the inventory department and if I receive a call back I will update here.  Thanks everyone.Update: I haven\'t heard yet from Amazon, but I called Oral B.  They took this much more seriously.  At Amazon I got the feeling they thought I was scamming them, but Oral B took all my information, refunded me, and is looking into it.  Like I said I didn\'t really care about the money, but rather that I\'ve been using fake brushheads for a year and the fact that it still seems like Amazon is selling them.

I decided on this model because it had the separate timer - something I had come to really miss on my older model. It had the timer on the handle only, making it impossible to check during operation. And while it buzzed after each 30-second segment was up, I often didn\'t really remember whether it had already buzzed to signal that the full two minutes had been reached and kept brushing longer than that.But it turned out that the separate timer on the Oral-B 5000 is all around tedious to operate. First, one has to remove the timer stand, then the battery cover because the buttons to set the timer are hidden underneath the cover. Whether this was a misguided attempt at keeping the design minimalist I don\'t know. But having to fumble with this already didn\'t work for me - I can\'t help but wonder: What were they thinking?In the end, the timer never worked anyway - it is set to demo mode when one takes it out of the box, and the buttons in the battery compartment also serve to set it up for regular operation. Trouble was that my timer could not be reset to normal operation. It kept cycling through demo mode time and again until I gave up and returned the whole thing.As to the toothbrush itself, it seemed to work great, just as I was used to from the previous model (and the only reason I gave this 3 stars at all). But since I had gotten this particular one because of the timer, I decided to order the 4000 model instead and just put up with the timer in the handle - at least I know this will work.One last word: My old Oral-B toothbrush came with a nice, very sturdy fabric case. This one in contrast has a rather flimsy plastic travel case. Another disappointment. My conclusion: Too expensive for what it offers."

After reading a bunch of online reviews, I settled on the Braun/Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 brush and some extra replacement heads. Upon receiving the toothbrush, I was a little surprised at how large the handle is, but the brush heads are small enough to move around and focus on one tooth at a time, which is awesome. The polishing head is amazing, with the right toothpaste it feels like a dentist\'s cleaning! The flossing head seems to do its job, the long rubber flappers seem to reach further into the crevices between my teeth than an average toothbrush, although it is no substitute for actually flossing. Within the first couple days of owning this toothbrush I can already notice a difference in  my teeth, they feel amazingly clean and already look a touch whiter.

151,154,20100609,B00006ANDK,4,"June 9, 2010",A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX,"Gentle, but wish it was recyclable, like Preserve","I am a huge fan of powered toothbrushes - my mouth just doesn\'t feel as clean when I use a manual toothbrush. I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that\'s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference! I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads. They feel softer on my gums and so I think they are a gentler choice. I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth. I have been using these heads for almost 10 years and often get compliments at the dentist. Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums. Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best. I\'m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn\'t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth & gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.I do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect. I\'ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months. I find that the blue begins to fade after one month. I think I\'m an average brusher (twice or more daily) and I even have two toothbrushes I switch between (depending on which is charged & what bathroom I\'m in), so I would think that the indicator would last longer.This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE! Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (& recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual. (If you\'re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve. They sell plates, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, razors, etc. & I do really like their razors) I know that plastic recycling isn\'t the best thing for the environment, but it\'s gotta be better than throwing all these heads in the trash/dump/ocean... I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they\'re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.) But, I can only keep so many. Anyway, that\'s why I give this product 4 stars, instead of 5. Gentle, but wish they were recycled & recyclable.Many thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)"

I was looking to buy an electric toothbrush when I came across this at a local store.  The price caught my eye, and so I went home to do my research.  There wasn\'t much info/reviews at the time, but what was out there was positive.  So I went back the next day and got it.  After using manual toothbrushes for our entire lives, my husband and I were very surprised how much cleaner our teeth felt.  Like I said, we have never used an electric one before, so this is not a comparison of other electric toothbrushes.  My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual so it\'s not that important to me.  I am still amazed at the length of the charge, we can go a week with two people using it twice daily.  The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  I have found some info about defective and/or counterfit heads.  It is still going strong after almost 2 years of daily use, with no sign of lessening power or charge.  Overall, I think the price and quality of this toothbrush make it a great option."

The claim that your teeth will be noticably whiter in 21 days is certainly true.  What I like most about my Oral B is that is encourages you to get into a routine; clean and floss at bed time and polish the next morning.  I only wish I had bought one years ago.

The problem with Sonicare was durability (that was less than 2 years on average) and high cost. But I should say that when (once) it died during first year, it took one phone call to get replacement.Oral-B looked better per reviews and also it had cheaper replacement heads. So, we decided to give a try.As a toothbrush, it works differently from Sonicare and at the beginning we liked it quite more. But after a while, I\'m not sure which one I like more. In either case, it does job done. I would not suggest buying the fancy timer though.However, this one died in a half a year. By itself, one sample is not a statistic. But customer support was quite less friendly and we had to ship the toothbrush with papers for \'repair\'. At the end, we\'ve got a new one - but is was much more painful.Bottom line: I would rate the toothbrush about the same as Sonicare, quite worth customer support and (so far) same poor reliability. If this one will die within next year or two, I probably will switch back to Phillips."

However, after having received it, I\'m a little dissappointed.  It doesn\'t appear as though it\'s that big, but it feels very large in mouth.  It felt like I was trying to brush my teeth with my thumb.  I had trouble getting the brush into the far reaches of my mouth whereas before with the smaller head I had no problems.  I\'m not a small person either, I\'m 6\'1\' and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  It\'s really not that different than the standard head, it\'s just bigger.  I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  Because of this, getting the brush into every nook and cranny is now more difficult.  Also, because it is bigger, it\'s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.  I should have bought the single one just to try it out, but I was certain I\'d love the bigger one.  Oh well..."

I read reviews for both and went with the Oral B 5000.  The one I ordered had 3 different heads and included the travel case.  Instead, the one that came only had 2 heads and no travel case.  I see I can\'t even buy the travel case and when I called Oral B customer relations just now, I just got a busy signal.As to the toothbrush itself, it is much more bulky then my old Sonic.  Worse, is that you really have to work to not make a mess and have toothpaste run down the handle.  Yuk.Wish I had gone for the Sonic."

After a few weeks of exclusively using this toothbrush there was no noticeable whiteness difference for my teeth. It was easy to use and there were no issues with it. I chose to return to the Sonic and will keep this one as a back up. The reason for this was due to the brush head since I had already picked up a replacement pack. I really don\'t see how one could go wrong with either brand\'s lightweight sonic model. I think in choosing it will come down to which one is on sale or even color/style preference.

526,537,20100105,B0002KHU3I,4,"January 5, 2010",A1P948LMDI28W4,Great product though not perfect,"Being an engineer, I did extensive research before buying an \'automatic\' toothbrush, and wound up selecting the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  The Oral-B has one huge benefit over the SoniCare I was considering and that was the rotary action since the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750 also has \'sonic\' pulsations.  A lower-end Oral-B had the dual-action brushes, but wasn\'t \'sonic\'.  Did a bit more research on the Oral-B website and found this dual-action brush head to be compatible with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  This was just another huge advantage of the Oral-B over the SoniCare automatic toothbrush.  Since these dual-action toothbrushes weren\'t too expensive, I took a gamble and brought three 3-packs.  This was about 4-months ago, and I\'m still using the first one from my purchase.I definitely felt a cleaner difference from the dual-action brush head than the rotating brush head that came with my Oral-B.  The lateral vibrating brush not only help loosen gunk from your teeth, it also provides the surface area for the toothpaste, and an additional \'sonic\' surface.  With just the rotating brush head, I generally cannot finish brushing within the two-minute recommended brushing time and take at least 4 minutes.  With the dual-action brush head, I\'m able to do it in 2-minutes and my mouth feels much cleaner.  And my teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter.  I had cavity filings that were colored to match my yellowish teeth, and now I can clearly see that my teeth are a much whiter shade than my filings.  (This was without change in toothpaste, and actually reduced time in brushing).So what can be improved?  Three things.  One is the dual-action brush head is a bit thick, although not much thicker than the regular rotary brush heads.  Would be nice to have a flatter profile.  Second is that flossing action bristles should come on the rotary part of the dual-action brush head (like that on the rotary brush that came with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750).  And third, and the most important, is that the rotary part and the lateral vibrating parts of the dual-action brush head should be angled about 10 degrees to contour fit the curve of one\'s teeth.  This will optimize the contact surface at any time we\'re gliding the brush during brushing.  With these improvements, I would give it 5-stars... food-for-thought for any Oral-B employees reading this."

I find that most soft brushes don\'t do enough in removing grit and tartar from my teeth. So, when I tried this, I was about to give it away or throw it in the trash. But, then I did a double-take and ran my tongue across my teeth and looked at them carefully in the mirror. And, whaddyah know? It got every little speckle off of my teeth. It made them feel polished like I had just got out of the dentist. This is the first gentle toothbrush that I\'ve used that actually works well.

I really can tell the difference in my teeth\'s cleanliness and shine after only three days. I especially notice the difference on the biting surfaces, which seem smoother somehow. I also notice that when I floss after using this product, there is less \'stuff\' pulled out by the floss. I take that discovery to mean that this brush really does get in between teeth to remove food that normal brushes miss.A couple of other interesting features.1 - after 2 minutes, the brush noticeably pulses to alert you that you have passed the first brushing milestone - the minimum recommended brushing time. After 2 additional minutes, it pulses you again to let you know you should stop, having reached the recommended maximum brushing time. My wife, an exceptionally conscientious brusher, was amazed at how long 2 minutes really is. She had been under brushing for a long time.2 - The recharger acts as a stand for the unit, but you do not need to keep it plugged in to an outlet. A full charge lasts at least a week or more.3 - The unit seems well engineered, is easy to hold and the brush heads that come with the unit seem to fit \'just right\' in the mouth.4 - The first time I used it, the vibration was a bit surprising. It took my 2 or 3 uses until the novelty wore off, though brushing my tongue results is still a work in process. By the way, for those worried about sensitivity to vibration, I have mildly sensitive teeth, and the vibration has caused absolutely NO discomfort to any of my teeth.5 - Some people mention in their reviews that the brush was harsh on the gums the first time that they used it. I agree that the brush is a bit stiff the first time you use it, but after 1-2 uses, they seemed to soften a bit and now the brush seems to be very gentle on my gums.My only problem with this unit is that my wife and I are going to fight over it when I travel on business...Actually, there are a couple of short comings, but these should be easy to address. First, both of the brushing heads (which are detachable) are identical. A color band or some other distinguishing mark would be helpful to people sharing the device. Also, there is no battery indicator. I found out this morning that the battery was dying, when in the period of 30 seconds, the brush went from what seemed like full power to no power at all. Recharging it for 5 minutes allowed me to finish, but that\'s not an acceptable design choice. Perhaps a small red LED or an audible chime alerting users to a low battery will make it in to future designs."

It has an lcd display and comes with separate clock/stop watch that is kind of cool, but really unnecessary.  The toothbrush has 5 modes: normal 2 minute mode, extended 3 minute mode, sensitive mode, gum massage mode, and whitening mode.

After about 2 weeks, the battery display started to develop moisture within the display. At around one month, the display could no longer be seen since condensation had turned into large water globules that obstructed the display.With 4 uses per day by two adults, after 3.5 months, the toothbrush failed to turn on but would activate after a few minutes or sometime in the day by itself. It is apparent that the board has gone bad and the toothbrush is no longer useable reliably.Pros:This toothbrush has a holding stand that can hold up to four individual heads for multiple users, or different toothbrush heads. (Be sure to dry your toothbrush head before placing in case, or you will have a gradual soap scum build up)Multiple Settings for persons with sensitive teeth.Timer that displays vibrations by 30 second intervals for dentistry recommended minimum of 30 seconds per quadrant.Timer also displays time. (Would like to have had the timer lit since the angle is almost at 90 degrees and should be angled slightly higher by about 15 degrees more for adult use.)Cons:The price is high for what seems to be only a timer radio frequency linked display and a few lower setting for strength of brushDid not last long for something that is exposed to soap in mouth and running water when rinsedPower connection is very l;arge and takes up a lot of spaceaway from the electrical socket. (MOst people are limited to counter space in the bathroom)In conclusion, I liked the design and feel of the toothbrush but was very dissapointed that it broke on me after only a few months. A little red light displays on the timer to show if you are being to rough on your tooth enamel when brushing, which I liked but also wanted the motor to be as powerful as previous models. Maybe this was bad for my teeth, but I could feel the difference on the gum lining of each tooth when touching sliding my tongue for cleanliness.since some people have a hard time returning things, maybe this one should be bought in a store with a guaranty instead of online.

The brush comes with a spare head, and Oral-B offers a selection of head types, although I am uncertain if the difference between them is that great.  A less bulky handle would be nice, but then it would likely come at the expense of motor strength or unit cost."

The original must have lasted at least 10 years, but the replacement doesn\'t look like it will hold up as well.

If you understand the advantages and disadvantages and know what you\'re getting, this seems a fine reusable filter.  Be advised that if you have a Braun coffee maker you might need the Braun brand replacement filter as some off-brand replacement filters don\'t have the \'notches\' in the rim of the filter that you would need to fit some Braun coffee makers.The description of the product on the Amazon page that I ordered the filter from is wrong.

It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than \'brushing\' like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).2- It\'s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.3- If it pops out of your mouth while it\'s running, it doesn\'t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.4- It doesn\'t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever?

I find myself wrapping my thumb around the handle to hold it while brushing and, sometimes inadvertently, hitting the Mode button. So, I\'ll be brushing in one mode and then the brush will switch to a different mode -- this makes me have to hit the Mode button 3-4 times to cycle back through to the mode I want to use. Again, this is my fault, but I also blame it on the design of the brush.2) I find the brush head bristles to be way too hard/harsh. I have these brush heads: Floss Action, Precision Clean and Pro White. I am going to buy the so-called Sensitive brush head and give it a try.

2711,2782,20111104,B003UKKHB4,4,"November 4, 2011",A1VXIY1511XQK2,Oral B VS Sonicare flexcare,"I have owned the Sonicare Flexcare sonic electric toothbrushes the last 3 years and they break about once a year. After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up. Unfortunately i cannot tell you if they will last a long time since i just got mine about a week ago but i can tell you the difference between the two brands.The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you\'re not trying to, just when you\'re normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you\'re doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B\'s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i\'m brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B\'s. It\'s a bit annoying.The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy ine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They\'re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, but i\'ve yet to see how often they break. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They\'re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you\'re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain."

The smart guide lets you now when you are brushing too hard (which has aways been my problem) and has 5 different modes from sensitive, daily, massage and a 3:00 minute deep clean. It tells you when to move to each quadrant of your mouth and also when you are done, it vibrates thrice so you don\'t have to look at the screen.

Better than sonicare essence,This simple cheap battery operated oral b toothbrush cleans really well and the batteries last a long time! I bought this electric toothbrush along with a sonicare essence brush that my dentist recommended. I noticed that if I took a toothpick to my teeth after using the sonicare I could still scrape off plaque. I could find no plaque after using the oral b and my teeth felt cleaner and smoother. My sonicare now sits in the closet and I use this brush exclusively. Doesn\'t hurt the gums either nor jar the teeth with high vibrations.I noticed a few people have remarked that getting the battery cap off is difficult. The trick is to squeeze inward on the sides with some strength first and then pull off. Don\'t pull off when you are just starting to squeeze inward.

In this case, $16 for the heads and $11 to ship them.  I can\'t imagine from their weight, that they cost anymore than $2-$3 to ship, so how someone justifies the extra $9 is beyond me.Bottom line is that this is a fantastic product that I have been extremely happy with, but the seller\'s price is (in my opinion) misleading at best and probably could be more accurately described as downright dishonest."

2611,2674,20100827,B003UKKH6O,3,"August 27, 2010",AOVROBZ8BNTP7,Low Cost For a Reason,"Overall, the Vitality is a nice toothbrush. If one trusts the packaging, it out performs a manual toothbrush.  If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It\'s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one\'s teeth during brushing.I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one\'s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.So, it\'s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs."

Too Pricey for What it Does, Though","I have SLE and sjogren\'s (another autoimmune disease that has pretty much destroyed my salivary glands).  I do not have enough spit in my mouth, which leaves my gums fragile and my teeth prone to cavities - even in the front.  My dentist is great and is working with me to save my teeth and gums, but I have to stay on top of things.I have been using a sonicare for a couple of years.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The sonic waves sort of pummel out the junk between my teeth and loosen it up even places that the toothbrush cannot physically go.  However, that brush brutalizes my gums and the sonic action sprays stuff everywhere - my sink and mirror look like a crime scene after I brush.  The Oral-b 3000 cleans physically only - no sonic stuff, so it only gets the stuff the bristles can get to.  That amounts to teeth that are slightly less clean in spots than what I get from the other brush.  However, my gums barely bleed at all when I use this on the sensitive setting.If your main concern is gum disease, and you\'re a good flosser, I would recommend this over the sonicare, because you\'ll be able to massage your gumline without damaging good tissue.  Press the start button twice for the sensitive setting, and you\'re good to go.I deducted one star for the price point.  I think a brush this expensive ought to include sonic technology.  Sonicare has the essence for $40 less than today\'s price for the oral-b 3000,  but if you need a decent brush that will not hurt your gums, this is probably worth the added expense.  I give it an 8.5.  It cleans better than the lower-priced oral-b products - almost as well as the sonicare.  The sensitive setting is a really nice feature for people like me with fragile gums. And replacement heads are affordable - much less expensive than the sonicare."

2662,2728,20100915,B003UKKHB4,3,"September 15, 2010",AHFGCH8LANEZK,Oral-b vs. Sonicare,"I am a nut when it comes to dental care.  I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  I floss daily and have used a Sonicare electric brush for close to 15 years.  It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  That was a bit much for me.  And my teeth weren\'t that bad, it\'s just that he was very fastidious.  I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  And I ALWAYS swish my mouth out with water after eating or drinking anything.Anyway, when I got the chance to try this Oral-b, of course I was up for the challenge.  When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the other.After trying the Oral-b for a week, I can tell you that I am definitely a Sonicare person.  Here is the breakdown of my experience:Oral-b pros:*Handle feels nice in hand.  It has a silicone/rubbery grip that is ergononimic*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.Oral-b cons:*Way too noisy.  I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  Not a relaxing experience, I felt too stressed with all of the noise, lights, and buzzing.*The depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush head.*It does not stop after 2 minutes of brushing.  I am used to the way the Sonicare handle stops working after you\'ve hit the 2 minute mark.  With the Sonicare if I want to keep brushing after the 2 minutes, I just press the button again.  With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn\'t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  Next bullet point.*Loud humming with surge pulse.  This is Oral-b\'s answer to Sonicare\'s quadrant pacer, where it nudges you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn\'t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!*Single button control. It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.*Cleanliness?  I didn\'t feel like my teeth were any cleaner than they already were when I used my Sonicare.I still believe that liking the Oral-b or Sonicare is a matter of personal preference.  Cost analysis-wise, the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  But I prefer the Sonicare."

Yet within a day of using the new stuff, the inside of my mouth was entirely covered in canker sores. I even got one on my lips, a first.

Today it costs $60 on amazon while the Oral-B Pulsonic costs $47.  If you are in the market for a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I\'d say either of these would be a good investment.  Both have two settings, except it seems the Oral-B has the \'faster\' setting start first whereas the WaterPik starts a slower speed first.  The Oral-B is slimmer, lighter, easier to hold onto.  Both brushes come with base units but the unit for the Oral-B is smaller and lighter than that of the WaterPik, but it also is easier to push around by accident.  The WaterPik comes with 2 brush heads, the Oral-B, just one.  When recharging the WaterPik blinks and when it stops, you know it has been charged fully, the Oral-B does not.I have not experienced the trouble of the brush head falling off the Oral-B brush, and overall I would say that the Oral-B seems more \'powerful\' in its vibrations.  I can\'t say that\'s a bad thing, but after using the WaterPik for so long, it\'s something one has to get used to.  Overall I\'d say either electric brush is a good investment.  While you get a little more with the WaterPik, it is also a heavier brush and more expensive.  In the end, all they really do is vibrate and you have to move them around.  If I had a choice, I\'d probably choose the Oral-B (which I switched to as soon as I received it), only because it\'s slimmer and lighter and I find it easier to use."

The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars. But this head is great for quickie between meal cleaning, and as a bonus is pretty good at brushing off my tongue.This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure. Since EB17s usually run about $5 per head in 3-, 4-, and 6-packs, finding the EB417 about the same price is a relief.

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is currently for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $9.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are 3 of them).  There are other offers through Amazon for this exact same item for up to $19.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!  Currently, this listing is the best price for this item, but it might not always be in the future."

Since I like to do the back side of my front teeth together, instead I took the first 30 second pulse as, \'Ok, you\'re halfway through the top,\' and the second as a cue to move to the bottom.It\'s amazing, how much I had to force myself to stay on the top a full minute.  I didn\'t even realize I was brushing the lower teeth more.  I recently had a cleaning where I was told my upper back teeth had more plaque than lower. Now I know why!This will keep you even in your brushing time throughout your mouth, feel great, give you a terrific clean, yet be gentle.I was SO pleased that I got one for my hubby.

Additionally I find their recharge mechanism ingenious, there are no connectors, near as I can tell, it must use a magetic field. What I mean is that the recharge station and linking area on the brush are all both entirely covered in plastic, so there are no \'vulnerable\' spots for bathroom water to reach to short things out or gum up the works.I also find that I take longer brushing my teeth when I use an electric brush, I\'m not sure why I do so, I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.There is one major design flaw though. The moving bristle head has too much clearance between it and the rest of the brush, because it regularly, at least once a day, pinches the inside of my lips or cheeks, often to the point of breaking the skin, and at least once a week bad enough to make my spit turn completely red.It could be that my brush head is defective, I don\'t know, but it definitely happens, and it never happened with any of my previous electric toothbrushes."

The feel in the hand is a little big and clunky. All the various speed settings seem a little pointless...probably one or two settings would be fine.

I  was not keen on the idea since my experience is that a machine toothbrush can eat up the gums. However, I shopped around at CVS, online and decided on the Professional Care Oral B brand. I just love it. It was easy to set up even for me not a gadget freak. It has a timer and action in the brush to let you know when to stop brushing. The brush heads will set you back, but you can find them on sale as well as cheaper generic versions. One caution, do not use an electric toothbrush more than twice a day and do not use much over the recommended two minutes otherwise you risk scratching the enamel on your teeth, not a good thing to do. I keep my manual garden variety brush on hand for brushing between meals and for air travel. I would hate to be the one to halt takeoff because I did not disable my toothbrush, see instructions that come with the brush."

On my old Braun electric toothbrushes the head rotated and oscillated, on this toothbrush the head pulsates or vibrates.Is it any better? The shape of the toothbrush head seems better designed to fit the shape or your teeth, and it is larger than the old design, large enough to cover two teeth. But while the head is larger in surface area it is much slimmer in profile so it is much more comfortable to use, it feeling much smaller in the mouth. I also like the timer function, it has an overall two minute timer, but it gives a signal every 15 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth.I like this new toothbrush, it seems as efficient as the old style Braun but is much more comfortable to use, and it is a little quieter too. It is also much easier to clean their being no inner workings as on the old style heads, which I am sure must be much more hygienic too.As the toothbrush should run for a week on a single 14 hour charge it is not necessary to replace the toothbrush on the charger after every use, so the charger does not need to be in the bathroom. Using the toothbrush this way should prolong the the life of the rechargeable battery tooHowever, as yet their does not appear to be an Interspace toothbrush head (which I need to reach awkward spaces) available to fit the toothbrush, so at the moment I am using both the old, with the Interespace head, and the new.

2174,2224,20110211,B002HWS9GG,5,"February 11, 2011",A1JUGQ8IQRW5MA,Serious Fun for Your Mouth!,"Recently my old Braun/Oral B (about 6 years old) began to \'catch\' with every little maneuver, so I figured the motor was wearing out and decided to see what the latest technology had to offer. This brush is simply light-years beyond the old Oral B 3D! It seems more powerful and even more effective (another plus: this model can use the same brushes [Oral B Precision Clean] as my older model, so leftovers won\'t go to waste. This model also accepts other more specialized Oral B brushes).Many thanks to B. Johnson for pointing out the value of the SmartGuide. For me as well, it serves as a neat little bathroom clock. But the most surprising thing is that by breaking down the recommended two-minute brushing cycle into four groups of 30 seconds each (via a simple but effective circular visual cue), the SmartGuide makes the entire process seem to go by faster. (With old-style brushes, the usual two minutes of unstructured brushing casts you upon a veritable ocean of time. I was always surprised by how long it took for the brush to stutter its two-minute signal. Oftentimes, I just stopped when I felt like it!) You always know (1) exactly where you are in the cycle and (2) when to move on to the next quadrant. This unwittingly clever bit of psychology gives you a sense of making clearly defined progress and ensures that you\'re devoting equal time to all sectors of your mouth. I brush for the full two minutes now, with no sense of impatience. In fact, the experience is so pleasant that I almost always do a final general sweep for another 30 seconds or so.One more interesting detail: perhaps because of its higher speed, this brush seems to prevent water and toothpaste from dripping along the brush shaft. I used to have to put my chin up to minimize this minor annoyance with the old Braun. But after several weeks of using the 5000 (with chin still up but not so extremely), I\'ve not had a single drip.I\'ve always been a faithful tooth-brusher, but ever since I got my first electric brush, brushing has been so much fun that I look forward to it. This terrific toothbrush takes the experience to a whole new level. And most important of all, it cleans and stimulates better than anything else I\'ve ever used."

Normally I wouldn\'t buy a toothbrush for $100, but in a few weeks when I get $50 back, it will justify me spending $50, even though that seems a little steep for a toothbrush.  But nevertheless, its a steal of a deal right now.So onto the product. Overall I am very pleased with it.  My teeth felt amazingly smooth and clean after the first brushing.Since I\'m not an automatic toothbrush guru, I am not sure of the sizes and noise of others.  In my own opinion, I feel like it is a tad heavy and large.  But once again, its got a motor and battery in it unlike my manual toothbrush.I read other reviews about the base of the unit and storage compartment for the brush heads being too large.  I however have to disagree with that.  The base unit is just larger than the base of the toothbrush, as the toothbrush sits in it to charge.  The storage part holds 4 tips and snaps to the base.  Once again, I don\'t know how others compare, but to me the size of it seems perfect for my counter space (about 8 sq ft).The plug however seems large.  But oh well, I\'m also not an electrician so I don\'t know why it needs to be that big.The Wireless Smartguide is pretty cool as well.  It gives you a timer and choice of count up or count down modes and a ingenious idea of having 4 zones (for each section of teeth).  This 4 zone thing blinks for 30 seconds indicating which zone you should be brushing in and provides a visual timer of when to move on.  It makes it idiot proof for brushing for the correct time.  I find myself brushing for about 4 minutes because the 2 minutes fly by which is a plus to the health of my teeth and gums.I am really impressed with the \'extras\'.  Really, when you buy electronics you ALWAYS need to get your own batteries for it.  With this, the Wireless Smartguide came with 2 AA batteries in it, as well as 2 more.  4 batteries!!! You never get batteries included let alone EXTRA batteries.  Ha, needless to say, that\'s coll Oral-B.  You also get 2 brushing heads, the normal flossification head and the pro-white head.  That\'s another plus with getting another brush head included in the package.  You also get the travel case.  Which I haven\'t used yet, but still cool.I have read others complain of the \'roughness\' of the brushing.  The manual does state that it can take time for your teeth to become used to the brush and your gums may bleed some.  I however had no problems gum bleeding or feeling like the toothbrush was too rough.The only negative I can say about this toothbrush is sometimes while brushing the chewing surfaces of my teeth, the back of the brush head hits the opposite chewing surface.  It doesn\'t hurt, but it doesn\'t feel great either.  Guess I just need to remember and learn to keep my mouth open more while brushing.All in all, great product and would definitely recommend to my family and friends during the promotion period where you get 50% back.  Can\'t wait for my rebate check!"

Well, my brushing habits and checkups slipped over the years and that left me with alot of bad teeth and plaque buildup.I now get regular dental care and try my best to keep my teeth looking their best. that\'s where this product comes into play.the design is wonderful. simply place toothpaste on the replaceable head and brush all your teeth including your gumline. you will get the feeling that you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. this gets deep into every nook and cranny of your mouth. it really works and stregthens your gums, and if you floss regularly your gums will no longer bleed when brushing.battery life is mediocre, sometimes lasting a a month or longer depending on frequency of use. i use mine roughly 3 times a day and i get about 5 weeks out of  a standard raovac AA battery. which to me, is acceptable.don\'t not press down to hard when brushing, this will cause the head to wear out faster than need be, and it will fray very easily if you use alot of pressure. just go ahead put some toothpaste on the head and play your favorite 3 minute song, and you will be on your way to better oral health. the benefits from switching from manual toothbrushes to this one have been enormous! my dentist actually commented on how clean my teeth were.this is a cheaper alternative to paying 60, 70, or 80 bucks for the higher end models. replacement heads are a little more expensive than normal manual toothbrushes but having cleaner teeth was a sacrifice i was willing to make.an overall great product. good alternative to more expensive brands. way to go oral b!"

My last model was sold as a two pack from a membership-based big box store. Those lasted my family about 2 years before the batteries started to loose their ability to hold a charge. I purchased this when it was a featured \'gold box deal\' and do not regret it one bit. Although it comes with a higher price, the performance is remarkable. I fell as if I am leaving the dentist office after each time I brush my teeth. The timer is more of a novalty than anything, but I do like the visual feed back to know when I\'m applying too much pressure while brushing, etc. Having a clock in the bathroom is also a nice bonus. I would recommend this without any reservations. Paired with the floss-action brush head has been the best expierence for me."

I somehow found the first three but, unfortunately swallowed the forth today. The small piece makes thebrush head rotate in a uniform patten.  When it breaks you can stilluse the toothbrush but, with lesses results; what\'s the point in that?If your order packaging looks old and worn, the plastic is old also causing premature aging of the plastic heads making them brittle.

There\'s not.Although the package claims that the toothbrush cleans between teeth, you\'ll definitely still need to floss. I flossed after brushing, and I would say that there was less crud between my teeth than when I use a regular toothbrush, but there was still some (especially the back teeth; there was hardly any in my front teeth).I would definitely recommend this toothbrush, as long as you\'re OK with its intensity.

I had recently bought the same exact 3-pack from a store, so I compared the ones I got to the genuine oral-B refills, and noticed the following: the bristles are not really standing straight up like the real ones, the center bristles are of different color, and even the \'oral-B\' trademark on the brushes are of different color (the trademark should be blue, but the one on the fake brushes are gray) and small than the real ones.  the packaging looks almost the same (the fake package even says the brushes were \'made in Germany\'), but there are subtle differences: the font on the back of the package is much thicker than that on the real one, the \'2\' attached to the 2nd picture on the back of the package is lacking the shadow, and the pictures are fuzzy.

2601,2664,20100906,B003UKKH6O,4,"September 6, 2010",AC24H4N4HYNU5,Nicely priced for a first-time user of an electric toothbrush,"This is my first electric toothbrush. I am extremely happy with it. I would recommend it as an entry-level electric toothbrush to those who are too unsure about the technology to pay for one of the more higher priced models.Full disclosure: I received this toothbrush free as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, at the low cost of $29.99 I probably would\'ve bought it anyway. I think it is definitely worth that price for a first-time electric toothbrush.PROSCLEANING: My teeth get much cleaner when I use this toothbrush versus my traditional one. They feel smooth, just like I came from the dentist. Flossing also seems easier while using this toothbrush because, with the right tilt on the brush, it is better able to clean between my teeth and at the gum line, so there seems to be less tartar buildup when I floss.WHITENING: The stain removal is EXCELLENT. My teeth are not that stained, but during the 2 weeks I\'ve been using this brush, I\'ve noticed a *significant* decrease in the yellow stains near my gum line.BATTERY: This may sound odd, but I liked the way the battery ran out. I was a bit concerned about what would happen and how I would handle it (the instructions give no clue). It pretty much just stops working, no wind-down at all. I liked that because it left no mystery as to \'will it or won\'t it\' finish and I just finished brushing my teeth with it manually. I\'ve used this toothbrush 1-2 times per day for over 2 weeks now, and I\'ve only had to charge it once.REPLACEMENTS: The brush indicates when it needs to be replaced via color loss on the bristles (just like some traditional toothbrushes do). It does come with an extra head, as well as a $3 coupon for another one.CONSDROPLETS: The only negative on this toothbrush is probably just due to my inexperience with electric toothbrushes: it sprays toothpaste droplets onto my clothing. Now I try to brush my teeth before I dress, or else I drape a hand towel over my blouse while brushing.VIBRATIONS: As others have mentioned, the vibrations are INCREDIBLY strong on this toothbrush. You should NOT press it hard against your teeth; just lay it gently onto them and let the brush do the work for you. My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive (I have several cracked ones) and once I stopped pressing with the brush, I had no problems with pain due to the vibrations. However, the vibrations DO make my nose ticklish.Unlike other reviewers, I have NOT experienced any \'gunk\' buildup in the toothbrush stand because I always rinse off my toothbrush the way the instructions say to.

I\'d already purchased one at my local pharmacy -- total bill for the toothbrush and a set of replacement heads was $116.  Amazon price: $66!  So back to the drug store I went....This is a great toothbrush so far.  I had a few years old Sonicare and I find the Pulsonic to be as powerful and easy to use, but in a much more elegant package.  The two speed mode is nice and easy to operate.  The brush head has been safe and secure with no evidence that it could come off as some report.  While I agree with those who would like to have a travel case, this brush fits easily into a plastic sandwich bag.  Overall a great purchase experience and a very good product so far.

It took some getting used to but after I did I felt it was doing a good job. I recently tried the Oral-b Dual Clean and found it to be a very old school design.  The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  If I only had the choice between this and a manual toothbrush I would choose the manual brush.  I\'m sure it does an okay job and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  I also suggest considering sonic brushes that do not have rotating parts, I think after you get used to them they leave your mouth feeling cleaner."

I read some reviews from other users online and all said that it had to be a faulty brush head. I had purchased replacement heads at the same time so I tried it. It worked just fine so I don\'t have to return it. I really like the toothbrush. The handle is slim so is easy to hold onto. My old Sonicare was huge and cumbersome for me to use.

At first, I was shocked.  This thing vibrates (like a buzz) your head when brushing the top teeth.  It is kind of like a dentist drill but much more dynamic.  It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \'dentist office\' cleaning.  After one week I have already seen the difference.  The company advertises two weeks, but one will show results.  It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  The bristles are somewhat hard without the slightest irritation to the gums.  Since this device uses NiCad batteries, I do not keep the charger plugged.  It has gone 2 weeks without need for recharging.  That is amazing.The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  The \'timer\' feature is great and is very useful.  The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  The tiny brush (floss head) supplied with it is useless.  I wish they would have placed an extra tooth brush in it\'s place.  The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  It is hardly bigger than a manual tooth brush.I very much recommend this tooth brush.  There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.  I question whether the costs difference would be worth it."

NOTE: the annoying part about the smartguide is taking off that darn battery cover! other reviewers weren\'t exaggerating about that at all! the clock on mine is still an hr behind since i couldn\'t remove that stupid battery cover to adjust the time.i\'ve only used two brush heads so far, whitening and floss-action. i\'m not sure if the whitening head really whitens like a whitening strip, but at least mine aren\'t staining even without using whitening toothpaste. the floss-action one doesn\'t really \'floss\' well. when you start off, it might be a good idea to use the sensitive or whitening head since the bristles are softer and more gentle on your gums until you\'re used to the \'power\' of an electric toothbrush.overall, i do love the toothbrush and even bought a couple additional ones for my family as gifts. so, i definitely recommend it."
1600,1641,20080904,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 4, 2008",A3FXT4UPI30K7S,Absolute Must-Have Excellent Travel Size Sonic Toothbrush,"The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush far surpassed my expectations in terms of size, weight, sturdiness, quietness and functionality for a sonic toothbrush. Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week\'s time, in my case of twice daily use. While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful! Not only is this toothbrush built for home use, it\'s the one you won\'t want to be without wherever you go.I especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I\'m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds. The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who\'ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have... yet I found I can get used to the sonic sensations, and I even feel that my gums and teeth are gaining strength, cleanliness and overall health. Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.So just how compact is this toothbrush? At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one\'s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing. The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth. The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.The directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I\'ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do). Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question. This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush I don\'t want to live without!  Highly, highly recommended."

Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don\'t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don\'t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don\'t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.

You know, when he gets the polisher out and rubs your teeth with it.  That is pretty much the same sensation you get with this brush.  I had to learn to not hold it against my teeth so hard because it was vibrating my entire head.I have to caveat.  I also own a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  To be honest, I think that the Sonicare feels better on my gums and also I think it does a better job overall.  HOWEVER, I hate my sonicare because of the way it grows mold.  The new sonicare models get your nasty toothpaste-spit mixture inside of the brush head where you can\'t see it growing mold.  Unless you actually unscrew the head and wash it out every day, and leave it taken apart to dry out, you will get mold inside your sonicare - and once that happens the brush pretty much smells like mold for the duration of its life (there may even be mold inside of the handle itself which I just cannot see without breaking it).This is not the case for the Oral-b Vitality.  The vitality features a snap-on type head which has no cracks to allow water to seep through.  The new sonicare features a flexible head, which I believe creates the problem with the mold (the old sonicares did not flex nor did they have the same mold problem).  The Viatlity head does not flex, it\'s just a straight snap-on piece with a rotating brush head at the top.Another thing I like about the Vitality is that it has changeable heads.  There are different heads which you can attach for different uses: Floss-Action, Pro White, and Dual Clean heads.  I use the Floss-Action and Pro White attachments - 2 minutes for each attachment.  The Floss action feels somewhat similar to a normal brush and gets all the stuff off your teeth, but the Pro-White has a weird yellow rubber thing in the middle of the bristles which rubs up against your teeth and whitens/polishes them.The Vitality also beats the sonicare in that it\'s brush heads come in packs of 3 for $20, whereas the sonicare offers packs of 2 for $20 (however, I believe the sonicare claims it lasts for 6 months and the vitality for 3).BATTERIES - the sonicare lasted about a month on a single charge - the Vitality only lasts about 2 weeks.That is all I can think of to put in this review.  The only reason I gave this brush 4 stars instead of five is because I wish it had more of a Sonicare vibration action - however it has an interesting rotating action which takes some getting used to.  The Vitality just doesn\'t feel like it cleans the gumline as well as the sonicare did - but at the same time it feels like it cleans the surface of the teeth better than the sonicare."

Buzzing about in my mouth and definately making the gum area very clear and stimulated. A real massaging of the gums - which I know from my dentist that this is a good thing. Healthy for the gums.It was really amazing. It felt incredibly clean and especially clear of foreign materials. I am a flosser by nature as well..and I noticed after several days of usage...that my flossing showed less and less particles between my teeth. And those particles came out easier - even popcorn!What\'s really nice is it comes with and extra brush - either for use with two peeople or use one as your back up and it plugs into the wall nicely. There is no battery replacement however because it is magnetically charged the hand unit does not plug intothe wall. Free from cord or plug issues being close to water.It was packed well and comes complete with operational instructions as well as infomation on how to brush properly with it. All in all a great investment for good gums and clean teeth. Your dentist will notice the diffeence if you use it regualrly and properly I am certain of that!(Don\'t forget to floss and gargle too!)  8-26-10Just an added note...I have been using it now for two months! - I have had better check-ups, better breath and my gums \'feel\' stronger!  9-27-2010"

It was nothing to write home about and was very basic compared to what is available these days. Once the battery went dead, I just went back to a manual toothbrush. I decided after my dentist appointment that my wife and I went to a couple weeks ago and having to pay $70(times 2) out of pocket as my copay for a deep cleaning for each of us to remove build up under the gums that I would see what was available in a rechargeable. It was a toss up as my dentist recommended both Oral-B, but only carried SonicCare with a $15 rebate at the front counter for sale. While at the Dentist office, I did enter a drawing for their top of the line SonicCare FlexCare Plus with Sanitizer by donating some can food for a local food bank for Thanksgiving. I am the type of guy that if I brought 999 cans and had a 999 out a thousand chance would not win in a drawing. I went home....researched both brands....read tons of reviews and checked the pricing on Amazon. The Oral-B reviews were consistly higher and the price with the 50% rebate on this model made it a hands down easier decision. This professional care toothbrush normally $159.99 retail was on Amazon last Wednesday for $104.99. I purchased 2 sets. They arrived at my door yesterday, with the free shipping and no sales tax. I was impressed when I opened them as to all that was included. My mindset was ....wow....only $50 for all this per set after rebate. It comes with at nice durable blue travel case that houses the toothbrush, and 2 brush heads. A nice travel charger that is multi-voltage and will work in other countries such as UK or Australia. It even came with an extra set of duracell batteries for the remote control clock/timer. I thought that was a nice touch that they would include those. The rechargable toothbrushes were both battery dead, so I set one up in each bathroom, and let them charge overnight to full charge. I used mine first thing this morning and was pleasantly surprised as to how easy and proficient it was brushing...I mean.... 30000 brush stokes per minute is 500 per second and I know I was never doing that manually. It comes with two different styled toothbrushes...one round and one flossing type. The flossing type is my favorite as it actually is flossing while brushing, so it is a 2 in 1 brush. Your teeth will feel like you just had them professionally cleaned at the dentist office. That nice squeaky sound when you touch your teeth with your finger. The toothbrush has like 5 settings for brushing from Sensitive to Deep Clean. The default setting worked perfectly for my teeth and gums. The little handy remote control timer......sits to the side and not only gives you the time of day, but when you turn on the toothbrush it automatically starts a 2 minute timer or 3 minute depending on how you set it up and times you on a 2 minute timer to 30 seconds per quadrant and lets you know when to move to the next set of teeth in the next quadrant and gives you a smiley face when you are done.  Funny, as I was typing this review I got a phone call from my dentist telling me that I won the raffle for the $189.99 Sonic FlexCare+ with sanitizer and that I could come pick it up. While I have never won anything before I am more hyped up on the Oral B and will likely just sell the SonicCare FlexCare+ on Craigslist for more than I paid for both of my Oral B\'s together. I apologize if this was too wordy. I am not a professional writer and I base what I buy off of what others write and just did not want to miss anything."

I was told by my dentist to stop brushing so hard (slightly receeding gumline) and this toothbrush has helped me tremendously. My teeth have never felt more clean and I am no longer having sensitivity issues. It makes me feel like I have just had a cleaning at the dental office. It seems a bit pricey at first but I have always been able to find the brushheads cheaper than manual toothbrushes so it makes up for it in the long run.

2673,2742,20100827,B003UKKHB4,4,"August 27, 2010",AL5OEDM8TPTKV,My First Experience...,"... with an electric toothbrush. I\'d been considering trying out an electric toothbrush for a couple years now, after issues with gingivitis. However, the expense of a unit deterred me from purchasing one. The Oral-b 3000 is a sturdy unit, easy to use, and in a word of a novice user, quite a bizarre experience.To move from manually brushing your teeth to an electric brush requires a period of adjustment. The unit is very easy to use, and comes with features that make decisions about brushing teeth easier. For example, the unit recommends brushing each side of the mouth for thirty seconds; thirty seconds for upper left, thirty seconds for lower left. The unit actually pulsates at you when its time to switch, so little thought is required.Another feature I appreciate is that if you apply too much pressure to the brush, the unit will let you know by slowing down. It\'s a feature designed to protect the tooth from hard waring action. I do appreciate that.The bizarreness of the experience is the actual brushing. The sensation of whirring against my teeth immediately transported myself to my dentist\'s chair (never a pleasant time, in my opinion). Perhaps it was the sound as well. The sensation of a pulsating unit in my mouth brought up images of drills, and cavities; not all together pleasant.One drawback is already mentioned in another review. When the unit\'s rechargable batteries die, so do the unit. I\'m not sure how long they will last, but I would have to ask myself, would I spend money on another electric toothbrush when this one dies? At this point I cannot say for sure. I need to give the unit time to see if it is effective, and I\'ll know more from my dental hygeinist after my next dental appointment."

It doesn\'t irritate my gum and cause the pain like other traditional toothbrushes do when pressing close to my gum to clean more thoroughly. This is my first power brush and it excels my expectation. One thing I wonder about is that if the charger will be wasted faster if I leave it plugged whole day. To avoid/slow down this process, I try to recharge it only when the brush head vibrates really slow and unplug it after an overnight recharging. I don\'t know how other professional brushes compare to this one. But for just $19.77, I think this is a very good deal. I am very happy with it."

I bought 3000 series and instantly noted that it was of much better quality than the Vitality.  The brush is super strong, and a red LED will indicate if you\'re brushing too hard. Another bonus is that Oral-B redesigned the charging base, making it much easier to clean than previous generations.My only real complaint is that the brush will indicate when 30 seconds has passed by stopping, then restarting suddenly. That feature (meant to alert you when it\'s time to brush a different quadrant of your mouth) is somewhat irritating as it feels like the batteries have run out momentarily. I would prefer a chime or LED indicator.  Other than that, it\'s a decent choice of electric toothbrush."

If you don\'t want to read it all, I give you this quick summary. Great product, well worth the price at amazon. Best clean you can get and has many useful features. I have never had healthier teeth and gums. Read further for more details.This product is simply outstanding and in a class of it\'s own.I had a situation in which my gums are not in their peak condition, and that is putting it lightly. I have had this toothbrush for just a touch over two weeks. I also drink coffee every day, only 1 cup though. Since I have been using this, my gums are already noticeably healthier, my teeth are whiter, and I find it easier to make sure I brush at least twice a day. I think this is mostly because of how much I invested into this product. At this point I have nothing but good things to say about this toothbrush.I also have my wisdom teeth fully grown in and this toothbrush is small enough where I am able to reach them and give them a proper cleaning. My wife is also using it with a separate brush head.The device takes a full 10 hours on initial charge before use, as seems to be normal for most NiMh batteries. At first the backing on the timer is a bit confusing and difficult to get off as the instructions do not help. Once you figure it out though, It is quite easy to master.Positive feedback:Now onto a more descriptive part about the features this offers. Since my gums are sensitive to begin with I can only use the normal clean and sensitive options until my gums are healthier. The other modes are a really nice feature that I plan to use when I can.The included 2 sided tape is nice for when you want to mount it to the wall.I really like how both the toothbrush and the timer give you an indication of when to switch quadrants in your mouth every thirty seconds. The timer will blink and display that you should be working on the next quadrant. The toothbrush pulses every 30 seconds and pulses 3 times every 2 minutes. (I personally don\'t think 30seconds is enough for each quadrant so I often spend more time after brushing to give my whole mouth a quick once over.)Once you get the timer set and mounted it does make a nice restroom clock as other have said. After charging and setting the timer, the toothbrush is easy effective and gives the best clean I have experienced sans a dental visit.Also a side note, I asked my dental hygienist which toothbrush they recommend for electrical as they said I should get one. This one came at the very top of their recommendations. Before this I was using Oral-B\'s cheap $20 electrical toothbrush. The difference is astounding.The container for the extra toothbrush heads is very nice allows you to let the head dry out while not connected to the handle. They brush heads are very easy to remove and clean. The different color rings are very helpful if you have more then 1 person using the same style brush head.The travel pack is a really nice and touch and is compact too.Best clean you can get without visiting a dental hygienist.Negative Feedback:The back plate on the timer is a bit unwieldy at first.The toothbrush is a bit loud but not as loud as the $20 dollar variants.IT would have been nice if the battery came pre-charged. It would also have been nice if the timer also came with a rechargeable battery solution.It is expensive and costs way too much at a standard retail store($150).It only comes with 2 brush heads."

Oh, and put it in your mouth first, or risk some dramatic toothpaste flingage.The brush will operate for two minutes, \'stutter\' a bit to let you know the time is up, and then keep operating until you turn it off. No worries about being partway through a complex brushing maneuver when your two minutes are over.As for the brushing, IT IS INTENSE.  Seriously, my whole head vibrates, and my teeth are super clean.

944,963,20110107,B000AUIFCA,4,"January 7, 2011",A1FVN80HHHR3RA,"Nice to use, may not be for everyone","So I\'ve been using the Oral B Floss Action heads on my Oral B I\'ve had for about 4 years now (still going strong!), and overall, I\'ll say I like it.First, the bristles are stiff, much stiffer than even the regular replacement heads. This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives. While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.Second thing to note, this shouldn\'t be a flossing replacement. You\'d think it\'d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely unnecessary.Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.So, with that, you\'d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right? Well, maybe not. For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn\'t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush. I don\'t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn\'t feel radically different from using a medium bristle brush.These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth clean.Finally, these heads seem to fit my teeth perfect, but I should note, I have a large mouth and large teeth. As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they\'d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/mouths.All in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone."

Better portability; however, because of the small diameter of the base, it doesn\'t stand upright that well (but too big to fit in any toothbrush holder slots)- Charging Base...takes up a very small footprint on sink- Price...much lower than many newer Oral-B/Sonic-care brushes- Performance...cleans extremely well, takes a week or so to get used to it.I did try it out for a day or so, too (don\'t tell the wifey!!!) and was quite pleased by the pulsing sensation and the way it made my teeth feel/look.

It doesn\'t.The brush head is gentle yet powerful.I did not get any bleeding when I first used it so I guess my teethand gums are in fairly good health.I like the gum massage and the way it cleans around the teethwith hardly any effort from me.I like to use it for the full 2 min. with a gentle reminder from the device,which is when the unit starts to have an intermittent slowing motion.There is no alarm or jingle sound which is great if you don\'t want to wake up the familyor can\'t handle noises in the morning.The recharger comes with it and I prefer to keep it on charge just in case.I have no complaints, except the price of replacement headswhich will be needed in the future.I would recommend this unit to anyone."

Then one day the evil nemesis time took it all away as my Sonic powered toothbrush ceased pulsing its distinctive sound of a million mad mosquitoes.  My wife, as she is wont to do,never wanting anything to do with my inter-spatial toothbrush saw this as the opportunity to finally throw it in the trash. For days it lay in state at the bottom of the can. It was a vision of pure sadness as I knew that now, once again, my elbow must flex and my hand once again must clench the minuscule handle of (gulp)...a manual toothbrush. The thought of losing another energized brush kept me away so for years I maintained only memories of the mad mosquitoes that once blasted calculus to the oblivion. If I had only had that Sonic brush in Mr. Farkner\'s math class, I often thought, perhaps I would have passed. I spoke often to my wife about finding another sonic calculus blaster but this brought only glares. For, as I have previously stated, my wife hated every tiny sonic wave of it\'s tiny brush and nearly forbid it.As I sat in the body conforming chair of my dental hygiene adviser, mirror in hand, viewing my pearly off-whites the bad news came; word by grating word; \'You\'re a lousy brusher\'. These words came from a mouth I could not even see.  Was it true? Is this why she protected her mouth from mine with that veil? For the second time in my life I learned calculus is no fun as she told me I must return for two whole hours of scraping. And it was all my fault. \'This\' she proclaimed after quickly unveiling her mouth \'is an Oral-B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush. and it alone is the answer to your inadequacy\' Wow, it was a mouthful and I was not even sure I could utter that many words without removing the cotton from my cheeks but I still tried. \'A mmmpphh, mmmphh\'. I gave up protesting further only in my mind. \'But it has no sonic drive!\' I though. Seeming to read my thoughts she smiled and curled my fingers around the handle. \'It has modes, lots of modes, and the brush is big, big enough to massage your gums, and who doesn\'t like a gum massage...right?\' I pondered her words as she veiled her mouth again and scraped her way slowly through my calculus problems.As I left her presence, and all the way home on the bus, her words rang in my head. At the first opportunity I searched the World Wide Web for the best price and found a quick trip to the Amazon was in order. I pushed the right buttons and soon it arrived, wrapped incognito in it\'s brown cardboard box with that winky smile. Inside, nestled against it\'s plastic air pillow my new toothbrush rested from it\'s long journey. The air was electric as I pulled it from it\'s packaging and plugged it in. I hung it\'s cordless timer on the wall. I could hardly wait to massage my gums but the book clearly stated I must so I did. When morning came I grabbed the handle. No more clenched fist around a minuscule handle, this baby was large, form fitted to my hand and pulsed with excitement. I pushed the button . The brush came to life. Gone was the sound of a million angry mosquitoes on a mission of blood replaced instead with a sound of raw rotating power. The sound was humanly audible and no longer called dogs from every outside quadrant. At first my elbow still flexed back and forth, as though I were to do the work, but I soon learned I need only relax, position the brush over each tooth and let the Oral-B work. The timer on the wall counted up the seconds. Thirty seconds later the brushed pulsed on and off and I was off to attack a new quadrant.  In just two minutes I was done. The brush had solved my calculus problems for the day and the timer even smiled its approval. Awesome!"

What I found is that the Vitality has a lot more power -- judged by the vibrations in my head -- plus it\'s even lighter weight, has replaceable heads, and a timer.Lighter weight is good, as are the replaceable heads because that means the whole family can use one base, and you can replace the toothbrush-head after flu or colds.More power should mean that it cleans better.  What I found is that my mouth felt \'cleaner\'... BUT, after I let my teeth \'go\' and get rather \'grotty\' for test reasons, the Vitality didn\'t seem to clean any better in those hard to reach between teeth spots, than it\'s cheaper cousin.  To be honest, I\'m not sure what to make of this observation.  I tried the cheaper cousin after that, plus a standard toothbrush, and nothing worked except floss -- thank heaven -- so perhaps my expectations are too high and no brush would accomplish this task.THE SKINNY:::We will be switching to this Oral B toothbrush and the reason is that I think it\'s more cost effective for us than cheaper Oral B battery operated models that we are currently using.  Though more expensive initially, you can purchase replacement heads so the whole family can use one base.I like the timer.  I thought only the kids would benefit, but to my surprise I wasn\'t brushing long enough either.It doesn\'t remove plague like claimed, but it definitely has more power than our comparison Oral B\'s, and made my mouth feel cleaner.I liked that the brushes were NOT rock hard.  Rock-hard is not good for the gums.Pam T~mom and blogger"

It replaced my manual toothbrush years ago and has been very satisfactory. I do a fair amount of traveling and have been using an inexpensive, grocery store purchased AA battery powered model that has provided fair results.I have been using the vitality in my travels and am very pleased with the results. It has the dual heads that leave my mouth tasting fresh and clean and is far superior to the grocery store offering. To be sure it is much more expensive but the results, to me, are worth the extra cost. In addition to the dual head brush the timer is a nice touch and I have found that while it says the battery requires 16 hours to charge that apparently means to fully charge. I use the Vitality every morning and night during my travels and plug it in when checking into the motel room and find it always has an adequate charge.I agree with other reviewers that a travel case would be very handy as would a light indicating when the unit is charged. I am a bit worried about the battery used by OralB in this product after reading another reviewers comments as to the battery being of old technology and perhaps not as good as AA batteries. I intend to continue to use this unit extensively and will see how the battery performs. If there is a significant failure of some type I will update this review.So, overall I am pleased with this unit and recommend it without reservations except for the battery issue which may or may not be a problem. So far it has been far superior to my grocery store brands."

It does not use a lot of space in your bathroom.When I first used this power toothbrush it felt somewhat large, but then quickly it felt comfortable. I have been using an ultrasonic toothbrush for some time now with great results so far. What i really liked about this one is that you feel the head much more on your teeth and you feel the movement, so you end up with a feeling of having really clean mouth which I like much more than the ultrasonic.Another advantage for this one is that there are different types of heads for different uses, and they are considerably less expensive than the replacement heads for ultrasonic toothbrushes (which are almost as expensive as this brush is). I have been using my power brush for about two months, alternating with the ultrasonic, and it has worked perfectly.Overall, a pretty good power brush. For the price, this is an unbeatable value."

After 2 minutes it stutters a little more to let you know that you\'ve been brushing for 2 minutes.The other triangular button on the brush lets you switch between modes: normal, sensitive teeth, and whitening? I\'ve only used normal, but the different modes would be great for people who may have sensitive teeth!I LOVE this toothbrush. My teeth are noticeably whiter and definitely less tartar-y.BUY IT!

2472,2530,20120116,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 16, 2012",A1PM1NSMCOWG88,It will \'Take Your Breath Away!!!\',"Once in a while a product comes along that lives up to its hype and acclaim; thereby satisfying ones anticipated expectations. And then, there is the rare product that comes along which goes beyoyond the hype and acclaim. And which exceeds all expectations. Allow me to introduce to you the latter, the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush. I will not take up too much time by reiterating all the 5-star reviews. But do read these reviews; because they are right on the money. One review in particular claimed how using this product cured his bad breath problem. This claim really got my attention. I too suffered from bad breath. And no amount of brushing or tongue scraping would solve the problem of bad breath. So this claim along with many of the other positive reviews persuaded me to give the Oral-B a try. Results...Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Upon initial use it felt like I had been to the dentist office for a dental cleaning (and like so every time after use). And yes...no more bad breath...simply amazing!  Is the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush worth the price? Consider the convenience of getting a truly professional dental cleaning (at home) without having to go to a Dental Hygienist. Also, consider the cost involved of going to a dental hygienist for cleaning every six months or so. The Oral-B is worth the price many many many times over.  Note: If you have not had cleaning for a while (or not good cleaning), you may experience slight bleeding of the gums for a couple of weeks of use. As the toothbrush rids your dentals of the old and new trapped food particles (which will turn to plaque via bacteria if not cleaned of), you will experience bleeding less and less until no more. Be advised, the sticker that attaches the timer/clock to a surface, like a wall, is of industrial strength. When it sticks it stays sticked. You may pull away some of your wall, or other used surface, if you try to remove it after sticking it on. Like me, you may choose not to use sticker and just place timer/clock on sink counter-top (or a stand for eye level). However, I now use the timer/clock as a bathroom clock mostly. Because the the Oral-B toothbrush device also has a built-in timer guide. The quadrant cleaning method illustrated in the user manual seemed a bit tedious for me. I have developed a more desirable method for myself. This procedure is as follows: starting from the top chop going left outer...moving to back then going inner around to other side until at that back then around that outer side to where I started (spending a second or two on each tooth). And likewise with my bottom chop. Time-wise, the whole procedure takes around two minutes or so. You can follow the user manual guide or develop your own strategy. The main thing is to make sure that you reach all tooth and gum areas (top and bottom chops; inner and outer surfaces, and top of dentals).  Now then! How quickly should you get the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush? Don\'t walk. Don\'t skip or hop! Don\'t even run!! But warp-speed!!! And seek a desirable  merchant to acquire this dental magician."

I have an electric toothbrush that still charges fully and functions as new 10 years later! I say the same for their shavers.  This filter, ever after YOU break it WILL deliver the same coffee taste/strength.  Beyond durability, this filter\'s appeal also stems from the size of the holes in their mesh, which as mentioned in numerous other reviews, will give you an extra 8oz cup of coffee over paper.  Tip, if you want it to last 5 years or more, remove it and clean it soon after making your coffee, at the latest, when you have finished all the coffee in the carafe.  DO NOT bang it against anything to remove the old grind and DO NOT leave the hot soggy grind in the filter for any length of time, and NO dishwasher!  To prevent the oil build-up on the mesh, simply rinse with cool water outside-in ASAP, and place upside down in natural lit area so as to prevent mold.

I got a set of sensitive heads because I have sensitive gums and never tried the other heads.  I like the sensitive heads.  Between flossing and brushing with this thing, my teeth feel almost as clean as walking out of a dentist office.  I used to see plaque build-up between visits behind my lower incisors.  This brush manages to clean that plaque away.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  In the past, I\'d occasionally see bleeding gums while flossing.  I haven\'t seen that recently.The toothbrush felt funny to use at first.  My teeth felt like they were \'buzzing\' a little after brushing.  I don\'t notice that any more.  The handle feels bulky, but I\'m able to maneuver it fine now and I can certainly clean more tooth surfaces with this brush than my old non-electric brush.  What\'s nice is that you simply have to position the brush properly and it vibrates to perform the cleaning.  I like the wireless timer that guides me through brushing 30 seconds in each quadrant.Set-up could have been easier.  Instructions were so-so and removing the back cover of the clock/timer was more difficult than it should have been.  But, day-to-day use is easy and rewarding.After using for 6 months, the wireless display became very finicky over batteries.  It goes haywire if the battery isn\'t fully charged.  The first set of batteries lasted 6 months.  I replaced with fresh energizers; they lasted only two months.

Very fast vibrations with smooth brushing action.2. Rechargeable. Lasts 1 week per charge.3. Can change out the brush heads when they wear out.4. Charging base is clean with no exposed metal parts to rust or get corroded.CONS:1. Brush head is small for me. The crossfire brush has a larger surface area and gets more teeth at a time.2. Uses Ni Cad batteries instead of Lithium battery.3. Replacement heads are very expensive. You could get two heads and the toothbrush for the same price as the three pack of replacement heads.BOTTOM LINE:Excellent power toothbrush. Gets your teeth cleaner than regular brushing.Would have given it five stars if the replacement brushes weren\'t so expensive.

It took nearly 24 hours before the green charge lights quit blinking. They stop when the charge is complete. I\'m very happy with how clean my teeth seem after my first brushing session. The sealed box came with one FlossAction brush head.The handle I received says, \'TRIUMPH Professional Care\' and has the green charge lights on a gray background. It is NOT the digital display. My first guess is that this is the older model but some reviewers said they called Oral-B and were told the handles with a non-digital display (like mine) are the newest model, so I\'m not sure. I\'m also not sure if there are any improvements with a newer model - other than the display - that would make me want to be sure and have the newer model? I noticed that Amazon sales of the 4000 model are temporarily on hold while they investigate what appears to be the same issue.For now, I am happy and content with what I have. If anyone knows or learns more about this issue please let us know! The toothbrush seems excellent!Update: After reading through the model 5000 reviews going back to 2009, I now think that mine is a newer model afterall. Originally, they came with a 110/220 volt power adapter with the electronics built into the AC plug which made the plug that goes into the AC outlet overly large (some reviewers complained about the large plug). Mine has just a small basic 2-prong AC plug. Mine is 110 volt only and the electronics are in the charging base where the brush handle sits. Older units came with 2 or 3 brush heads. Mine came with only 1. So, it appears that Oral-B decided to cut some costs by removing the dual voltage and 1 or 2 extra brush heads. They also decided to change the LCD handle display to LED. Hopefully, they also added some improvements?! I\'m still happy."

The colored bristles help you figure out when the heads need to be replaced and the small size makes the brush easily fit anywhere in your mouth.

The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  It\'s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  And children may find it more fun to use.How many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  Typical for Oral B\'s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn\'t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  Separate on and off buttons, are located on the handle.The Pulsar is being packaged and sold in various quantities.  At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B\'s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work."

At first it seemed like way too much technology for something so basic, but after the short read through the manual and letting it charge I was ready to go and it only took a few uses to get the hang of.  The manual was very easy to read and understand and didn\'t really take that long to review.  Another reason that I decided on the Oral-B was because of the smaller head of the brush.  A friend of mine with another brand toothbrush said that she wishes that she had thought of that when she purchased hers.  It really is a great toothbrush and I do really feel that it deep cleans.  My only complaint about the toothbrush is that it is sort of loud, but on the sensitive setting it isn\'t too bad.  But if you need help waking up in the morning...maybe the noise will help!

If that sounds potentially troubling to you, I recommend just buying a one-pack the first time.  It\'s not cheap, after all, but for me it\'s been well worth the cost.  Do try it.I should also note that when I mentioned to my dentist that I\'ve been using this, she referred to it as a \'business killer.\'  I take that as another good sign."

I have to say it is the best investment I could have made. The timer is a valuable tool to keep me on track on brushing my teeth long enough. When I am done my mouth feels like I have been to the dentist and received my usual cleaning. I love this toothbrush!

I have always used a standard toothbrush and floss and it must have worked pretty well because I have no cavities!However, I will never use another type of toothbrush after using this one...the battery lasts approximately 1 1/2 weeks with two uses each day. It comes with two different heads, charging station, brush and timer. The recommended brushing time is 2 minutes with this set-up; it is amazing how clean my teeth feel afterwards! I have no plaque buildup, but floss for good measure anyway. :)I was so convinced about the effectiveness of this toothbrush that I bought my husband one for Christmas. Needless to say, he\'s in love, too!The only complaint I have is with both of us brushing our teeth at the same time, our timers malfunction. This is really a very small concern, considering the brush \'pulses\' every 30 seconds, reminding you to switch sides."

It doesn\'t last as long between charges (approximately 1/2 as long, 5 days instead of 10 days), and you\'ll need to be careful about letting it discharge once in a while because of the memory effect of NiCd batteries.It also lacks a lot of the frills of the other toothbrush. No LED light to indicating charging / charge full, and it does not pulse at 30 second intervals when brushing. It does pulse at the end of 2 minutes though.The brushing action is also different from the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush. The brushing action feels weaker, though I must admit the teeth feels just as clean afterwards. I tried the same toothbrush head on them - they appear to be interchangeable. I\'ve also tried the original toothbrush head. I can\'t judge effectiveness (they appear to all clean well) but the one that came with the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush feels more comfortable to me - better contact with the teeth.This toothbrush is significantly lighter, but otherwise the construction looks to be about the same level as the other one.I\'m giving it 4 stars despite the shortcomings because it is significantly cheaper than the other toothbrush. I think they balance each other out (I\'d rate my existing toothbrush 4 stars as well).For me at least, an electric toothbrush cleans teeth much better than manual brushing and although I\'m definitely not a dentist, I recommend them."

No pressure is needed to get your pearly whites cleaned and ready for the day and my son certainly enjoys his time with the toothbrush now.

It broke off, falling into my hand, as I was very gently trying to inspect it to see what was wrong. I hate paying retail for these, but I went back to biting the bullet on price to make sure I bought the real deal. I am happy I did. Make sure you buy the ones made by Oral B. You will like them. I have been using them for at least 4 years and let me tell you, the dental hygenist spends a lot less time in my mouth - and doesn\'t have to scrape and dig around the gumline so much anymore.

It was a loud and eventually became sloppy in holding the spindle from turning around requiring the handle to constantly be rotated. It still was very effective and still holds it\'s charge without fail.Long story short, I did research and ended up choosing the professional care 5000 over the 4000 as a replacement.  The sticker shock held off the purchase until I found a 50% rebate and free priority prime shipping.  I really prefer the \'polishing\' heads and bought 6 extra.  Net cost was about $55 which is about + price of the additional brush heads.There is no comparison between this and our old model.  It is quiet and has some cool features.  There is a visible battery (fuel) gage on the handle, and a transmitter to communicate with a seperate remote unit.  This thing times you, is a clock, and even blinks if you brush too hard. The travel case is well constructed and useful. Buy one...rebate took about 2 weeks...mine was a $55 check.PROS:  quiet- cool features- teeth feel like you just had a cleaning...squeek and all- noticed definate whitening almost immediately- find myself brushing more often by choice, angled position allows makes getting to back teeth a non-issue. We love it and highly recommend it.Check out the polishing heads which have a yellow rubber center. It saves the outer bristles and you still get more than adequate flossing and unbelievable plaque removal. It really extends head life especially if you brush hard, like my wife. Trust me on this; I smoke cigars.NEGATIVES:  Really none..somewhat pricey heads, but more gental than even soft hand brushes."

I bought mine from Oral Care Deals so this review is from their product, and I was very pleased by them. One thing that I absolutely LOVED about this toothbrush was its ability to change the brush tip, which also comes with colored rings that you can identify which person it belongs too. I initially was looking for an electric toothbrush for me and my husband but when i came across this one i found out that we can both use it and all we have to do is to change the brush tip. It comes with a brush tip holder that you can place 4 tips one, so basically 4 people can use this one brush, now thats awesome by itself! We found that the battery is long lasting so you don\'t need to charge it after a few brushes. the grip is comfortable and its easy on the wrist! every time I brush I get the same feeling as i do when i go to my dentist for my six month cleaning. My dentist even said this is the best one on the market right now.

It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on. Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth. Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode. Returning two of these and will probably go back to Sonicare for next purchase."

At first it tingled so much touching my tongue that I had to take a break from brushing, but after a few days I got used to it. I haven\'t used electric toothbrushes before, so I can only compare the Oral-B Pulsonic to manual toothbrushes. I find that the Pulsonic leaves my teeth feeling smoother than my manual toothbrush and, apart from the tingling, it doesn\'t seem to have any negative effect on my gums.Pros:* Non-contact induction charging mechanism means there\'s no metal contacts to get dirty and prevent charging* Built-in timer to remind you to spend the recommended 30s brushing each quandrant of your teeth* The smaller of the interchangeable brush heads allows you to brush hard-to-reach areas* Teeth feel very clean and smooth after brushingCons:* Non-contact charging mechanism is less efficient than a wired connection and therefore wastes energy* Rechargeable battery is not replaceable - the entire toothbrush must be replaced when the battery wears out* It doesn\'t come with a carrying case.

There are some pros and cons to this brush, specifically, there is no light to indicate that the brush is charging or when it\'s charged.  The pulsonic has a light that just shows when it\'s charging.  The pubsonic has a larger brush head but this brush gives a deeper clean, which is also somewhat of a downside due to the noise that\'s produced by the power behind the brush.  I thought the smaller surface area of the brush-head would make it an inferior product but I can\'t say that\'s the case.  With this price, this toothbrush is a pretty good investment."

2360,2415,20101002,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 2, 2010",A277KHX8TFTC58,Fantastic,"I\'ve gotta say, this Oral-B Smart Series 5000 electric toothbrush is incredible.  I was skeptical because I have been using its direct competitor for about a year, the top-of-the-line Sonicare Flexcare HX6950 with UV Sanitizer, and was very happy with that brush.  A friend of mine has the Oral-B smart series, and when I saw it, I knew I had to give it a try to see what all the hype was about.  I found the opportunity when my father asked me to order him one, so I threw in an extra one for myself.  It arrived in two days from Amazon, brand spanking new.I\'ve used the Orab-B for about a week, 14 times, and I have to say its different than the Sonicare, not necessarily better, but just different, and just as good.  The Oral-B gives you a different kind of clean, and I definitely feel my teeth and gums get a really, really good cleaning after brushing.  My teeth also seem whiter now.  I think the Oral-B removes more plaque off my teeth, and more food from between my teeth due to the optional Floss Action brush head I\'ve been using.  Don\'t be fooled, there is no substitution for flossing, but this brush head does a little for you, especially if you have bigger natural gaps between your teeth, of which I don\'t, so I have to floss.  The Floss Action brush head is really amazing, quite an innovation, and I love it.The wireless SmartGuide is pretty clever too.  It automatically goes on when you turn your toothbrush on.  I can definitely say, that the SmartGuide helps you to brush longer and more thoroughly.  Its almost like a trainer when your brushing, rooting for you to finish 30 seconds on each setting.  I do one cycle for the top teeth, and one cycle for the bottom teeth.  The SmartGuide is very helpful to anyone, no matter your age.  The four different stages of this electric toothbrush are also very helpful, I use them all, and always will.The Oral-B Smart Series 5000 comes with one Floss Action brush head, and one Pro White brush head.  I also ordered a 4 pack of sensitive brush heads, but haven\'t used them yet.  In addition, after seeing how much I like the Floss Action brush head, I ordered more of those, a 3 pack actually.  If your wondering about the price, forget about it, its totally worth it, and will probably save you thousands of dollars worth of needless dental work due to cavities.  I can\'t recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush enough.  In fact, if you have the money, be generous and buy them for other people that can\'t afford one.  Everyone should be able to use one of these, they are that beneficial to oral hygiene.  I can\'t imagine using a regular toothbrush after using an electric one, especially an electric on of this quality.As usual, Amazon is amazing for price, shipping, product quality, and customer service, literally the best store on the planet.  I don\'t even understand how other stores can stay in business with Amazon in existence.  I stopped keeping track of how much money I\'ve spent here in the past 10 years..lol."

One of the features of the 9400 is the short pulse every 30 seconds and a long pulse at 2 minutes.  This allows for even coverage on the four quadrants.  It also has a smiley face after 2 minutes, in case, you missed the long 2 minute pulse.  Feels really clean after using this.  The floss brushheads are very good.  The price was also very good (under $90).  One thing I was irritated was that the travel case can contain only two brushheads, while the charging base has space for 4 brushheads.  Excellent product."

My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why. Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:- practically no assembly required, it\'s ready to go out of the box- comes with a deck for the charger and slots for 4 heads. Storing the head keeps it cleaner, and you can use this brush for the entire family - just get different color heads and you\'re set.- all you have to do is move the brush around, no pressure needed. In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.- the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles- I love how sensitive the power button is. With CrossAction, I had to jam the button to get the brush going. With the 3000, you literally just tap it.- the brush takes about 17 hours to charge fully, and last for a week. However, I just keep it on the charger all the time since you can\'t overcharge it.The only thing that I\'m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space.

Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  The icing on the cake is the low price of this brush. Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  This is an excellent product. 4.5 Stars*** Positive Points: ***- Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)- Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3). The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).- It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base. You simply stick the raised portion of the charger into the end of the brush.- Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries- Brush vibrates to let you know when you have gone over the recommended 2 minute brush time.- 2 year warranty*** Negative Points: ***- Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.- There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.- The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouthOverall:  This toothbrush cannot be beat for its price.

The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days.  3 days is the new norm. That\'s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger.  It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference.  After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it\'s smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."

Recommended by my oral hygenist, it really cleans my teeth - makes them feel velvety smooth... just like when my hygenist finishes cleaning my teeth. I can\'t get that with any other electric or non-electric toothbrush. The better a product is, the harder I evaluate it and the more nit-picky I become, so here go the suggested improvements: First, the recommended cleaning time is 2 minutes which I believe is way too short. I double that by brushing the lower and upper jaw, each using the times for my entire mouth. Last, the controls are too easy to accidentally hit. This causes the toothbrush to go into another cleaning mode when you didn\'t want it to. I don\'t know how you can fix this except to be careful when holding the toothbrush and not accidentally hit one of the two buttons on the handle. I imagine if they located the controls elsewhere, or made them more difficult to press, I would be complaining about the ergonomics! Maybe a lockout on the end of the brush would help?

I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use. This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED. I was initially disappointed as I realized I had a brush head that didn\'t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed. URGH... I decided to give it the weekend before trying to call customer service on Monday to get a replacement. However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions. When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean! Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush (forgot what they call it) and the fact that it continues to brush past 2 minutes. The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines. And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!! And an added bonus is that the replacement heads are even less expensive and the brush it self had a $15 rebate so less than the cheapest Sonicare too.And I\'ve only had it 4-5 days now but I am certain my teeth are already whiter than they were and less stained!!"

We\'d sing the Tigger song while brushing, which helped make things fun. But I have a couple complaints:1. The whole thing is a little large and cumbersome for a 3-year-old. Getting the back teeth is tricky for him, and when we take over to \'do finishing touches,\' we\'d always end up bonking him on the teeth/ gums/ lips with part of this toothbrush. This made him mad, and when you are trying to convince a toddler that toothbrushing is fun, you do not want to make him mad.2. The brush head is not replaceable. So once the bristles are worn, you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one. Sure, the purchase price is cheap, but like so many things, that is not the \'real cost,\' once you factor in how many you\'ll have to buy and how many you put in the landfill. (Batteries are replaceable but the toothbrush is not rechargeable.)

Because of this I\'ve used the old fashioned manual brushes that did a reasonable job of keeping my teeth clean. Well, this tradition is about to change.After using this brush, my teeth have a smooth and polished feel all the way down to just below the gum line! Amazing! Even my manual brushes don\'t do as thorough a job. Also, the brush charges through induction which means that it\'s waterproof and has no wires or metal contact points that need to be protected from water. This is very cool.I could only find one minor downside to this brush which is that the head is somewhat thick. What I mean is that the distance between the bristle tips and back of the head makes it necessary for me to open my mouth fairly wide  to get the brush the tops of my rear molars. This isn\'t a challenge for me but it might be for someone with a smaller mouth.I guess I can summarize my review by saying that I\'m tossing out my manual brushes because this is now my personal favorite.

The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I\'d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a \'recognized name\' in oral hygiene (for whatever that\'s worth), and it\'s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).Since I don\'t have firsthand experience with other moto-brushes, I can\'t write a comparative review, but I CAN comment on this product\'s effectiveness in comparison with regular brushes, and that comparison is altogether favorable. Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before. This model features a two-minute timer, which is helpful. It\'s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well (I use it twice a day, and only need to charge it about once every eight days).Oral-b manufactures a variety of different heads for the Vitality line, and though I\'ve not tested the different varieties to see if they have markedly different results, I like the fact that the product is so well-supported; it means I probably won\'t soon find myself owning an obsolete brush for which I can\'t get replacement heads. The heads are sturdy, too, lasting me about three weeks or a month each.Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn\'t do things I don\'t need it to, doesn\'t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support.

I have used a combination of regular toothbrush, Rota-Dent, and Waterpik for the past several years so I\'m no stranger to trying alternate methods.  The head of the toothbrush is a bit stiff compared to Rota-Dent but the curved shape does a good job of getting the gum line towards the back of my (small) mouth.  After brushing with this, my teeth get that slick, super-clean feeling that you don\'t always get with a regular brush.I really like how it charges on a plastic base.  The hole the charger plugs into is all plastic, and the charger itself is all plastic - no places to corrode! It also has a small footprint so it leaves plenty of space on the countertop.  Oh, and it holds a charge for over a week!The bottom line is that this is a really good find for someone looking for an electric toothbrush and I would recommend it."

My dentist has told me that I need to floss regularly since my gums are receding.  This toothbrush a little louder than I expected, but remember this is my first power toothbrush.  I really like the two minute timer feature becuase my dentist always told me that I was always \'over\' brushing.  Since brushing with an up and down movement can wear off the enamel (as told by my dentist), the Oral-B toothbrush uses oscillating and rotating movement which dentists prefer.  The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited warranty.Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.

And the price is just a steal!Just a word about brush heads. There are various options for Oral-B, but basically two main ones: Precision Clean and Dual Clean. Precision Clean only has the round group of bristles at the tip of the brush. The correct way to use this brush head is to run it slowly over each tooth. This cleans very thoroughly. For people who aren\'t comfortable changing the technique they\'re accustomed to with non-powered toothbrushes, there is the Dual Clean.

The kit includes two ProWhite brush heads designed to remove surface stains and polish teeth bright white.  There are three types of brushing fibers in the ProWhite rotating brush, blue, white, and green, each with a different stiffness.  The longest and least stiff blue fibers gradually loose color with use indicating the remaining life of the brush (listed as 3 months).  There is a deep cleaning orange rubber center in the brush for deep cleaning of stains.  I have noticed a clean difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums after a week of using the ProWhite.The handle of the device fits the hand nicely because of its large diameter and a ribbed blue rubber grip covering the back of the smooth light blue plastic cylinder. The cylinder has a battery that is recharged by placing it upright on a plastic stand. The unit fits on the stand with a plastic receiver on a plastic plug, so electric shock to the user is avoided. The entire hand device can be rinsed completely (not the recharging stand).There is a built in timer on the Vitality that alerts the brusher when the recommended brush time of two minutes have elapsed with a noticeable pulsing action of the brushes and the accompanying change in sound from continuous to intermittent. After the timing alert, the device resumes continuous brushing.I highly recommend this rechargeable toothbrush.  I have switched from a regular brush to the exclusive use of the Vitality.

Small handle. It\'s not much bigger around than a regular toothbrush, especially when compared to the monster I\'ve been using. The charger is compact, too, and doesn\'t take up much room on my counter.3. Compact head. Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.4. Soft bristles.5. Vibrates rather than spinning. The spinning kind really chewed up my gums. This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations. Went away as soon as the brush was off.6. Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth. I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore. I don\'t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.7. Stops briefly to let you know when it\'s time to switch \'quadrants.\' (You\'re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.) When the maximum 2 minutes has elapsed, the brush gives a double signal.8. There is a precision attachment to get between teeth and into dental work.9. Does a fantastic job.

There\'s a visible difference.There are some neat features as well.  It beeps to let you know when you can finish brushing a quadrant of your mouth (like the Sonicare), and a bright red light goes off when you push too hard.  Brushing too hard can wear away the gums, damage that can be very difficult & expensive to repair... if it is repairable.  (Unfortunately, we have a lot of personal experience with overagressive brushing.)We\'ve also tried the Sonicare in the past, and found the Oral-B to be superior.  The Sonicare didn\'t really do a good job of cleaning our teeth.  There are some parts, esp behind the front teeth, that Sonicare doesn\'t really do a good job of reaching.

Also the battery has lasted a solid week of brushing.  That has been a nice thing so I can put the charger away for most of the week and take back most of the counter space.Pros: works really well!  Talk about clean teeth.  I feel like my mouth went through a super duper car wash.Cons: a little noisy and might be almost too powerful for some."

But then, having used it for about 2 month, the tip became very loose and I have to be very careful as I brush my teeth, for it could pinch my tongue or mouth!! I even bled for a few time. Yesterday I got to remember that before the blue color on the bristle would lose gradually, indicating when you need a new one. But after about 3 months, the color on this one was not lost at all (my husband is using it too, so neither was his). I seriously doubt whether it is real oral B. Be careful!"

1597,1638,20080904,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 4, 2008",A1ZM846Y7AUYD,A Breakthrough in Power Toothbrush Design,"I have used many different power toothbrushes over the past several years.  All have been from the Sonicare and Oral-B line of products.  I have been amazed at how the technology and design of these products have changed over the years.  They continue to get smaller, more powerful, and now tend to include multiple operation modes and interchangeable brushes and accessories.  Although there is clearly nothing wrong with scrubbing your teeth the traditional way, with a good old-fashioned toothbrush, I find that the power toothbrushes tend to remove stains better and keep my teeth whiter.Gone are the days when a power toothbrush was a rather bulky, noisy product.  Oral-B has introduced a new, extremely slim, power toothbrush that is not much bigger than a traditional (manual) toothbrush.  The new Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is truly a breakthrough in power toothbrush design.  Weighing a mere 1.8 oz., with the brush head attached, the dimensions of the handle and brush assembly is roughly 8 1/4\' long and only 11/16\' (just under 3/4\') around at the thickest part of the handle.  The brush head is about 2/3 of the width and 3/4 of the length of a traditional toothbrush.  The charging base measures approximately 1 3/4\' - H x 1 5/8\' - W x 3\' - D.  While I like the small footprint of the charging base, I find it a bit too light, which causes it to slide around on the countertop too easily.Some of the manufacturer boasted features of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush are as follows:* Provides Gentle Sonic Vibration - More than 27,000 Vibrations per Minute* Multiple User Modes:  Clean (normal) and Sensitive* Super-Thin Bristles for Precision Cleaning, Polishing  and Whitening*  Professional Timer, Providing Tactile Feedback at 30-second Intervals for Changing Quadrants of Your Mouth, and Once the Dental Expert Recommended 2-minute Brushing Time Has Been Reached* Provides Up To 30 Minutes Of Use Between Charges* Reduces Up to 94% of Surface Stains in 2 Weeks* Lightweight Slim Handle Provides Effective Maneuverability and Control* Warranty:  2-Year LimitedThe current Pulsonic S15 kit includes the following items:-  Oral-B Pulsonic Power Handle- One Standard Pulsonic Brush Head- One Precision Tip Brush Head- Charging Base w/ Brush Head Storage- Instruction Manual- Misc. Warranty and Registration PaperworkSetting up and using the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush couldn\'t be any easier.  The small charging base simply plugs into an available A/C outlet and sits on your countertop.  Although the instruction manual doesn\'t specifically mention anything about mounting the charging base, there are two slotted holes on the backside, which would allow for wall mounting.  Once the charging base is plugged in you simply sit the Pulsonic Power Brush handle into a recessed opening on the front of the base.  As with most rechargeable products these days, you must initially wait several hours for the device to charge before you begin using it.  The Pulsonic toothbrush requires 12 hours on the charging base before it is fully charged.  The instructions do not say anything about using the toothbrush before it is fully charged, so I guess one could try it out within an hour or two if they wished.  There are two other recessed openings on the base, to allow for storage of the included Precision Tip brush head and a spare standard brush head.  The front of the toothbrush handle has a single power/mode button and three indicator lights.  Two of the LED indicators show what cleaning mode the brush is in, when powered on (clean or sensitive), while the third LED lights up when the device is charging.  A single push of the power/mode button activates the power toothbrush in \'Clean\' mode, while a second push of the button switches the toothbrush into \'Sensitive\' mode.  Pushing the button a third time powers the toothbrush off.  Therefore, if you push the button once, and use the standard clean mode, you will need to push the button twice more in order to power the device off.Unlike the typical oscillating head type power toothbrushes that Oral-B is known for, which require the user to simply hold the head on each tooth for cleaning, this Pulsonic model requires you to move the head around in a circular motion while cleaning.  This can take a little getting used to if you are more accustomed to the oscillating brush-type models, like I am.  There is no need to scrub your teeth with the Pulsonic toothbrush.  You simply move the brush head gently over your teeth (in the aforementioned circular motion), letting the sonic vibrations perform the work of cleaning and polishing your teeth.  Although these vibrations are fairly gentle, switching to the sensitive mode reduces the strength of the vibration by about 1/3.  The vibration speed remains the same, but the intensity becomes gentler and feels less abrasive against your teeth.  While brushing, the Pulsonic toothbrush provides a short stutter (a single break in vibration), at 30-second intervals, to let you know that you are supposed to switch quadrants in your mouth.  Once you have brushed for the professionally recommended 2-minutes, a longer stutter (two breaks in vibration) can be heard and felt.  This form of tactile feedback is quite effective in keeping the user informed as to the status of their brushing session.Once you have finished brushing with the Pulsonic toothbrush, cleanup is a snap.  You simply run the brush head under water and rinse thoroughly.  To better clean the top portion of the toothbrush handle, you can easily remove the brush head attachment by turning the head counter-clockwise (about 1/4 turn) and lifting it off the handle.  The top portion of the handle can be rinsed under running water, but it is not recommended to run water over the lower, controller portion of the handle.  Reinstalling the brush head onto the handle is as simple as lowering it into place and giving about a 1/4 clockwise turn.  You will hear and feel it click into place.  Cleaning the charging base is just as easy.  Since you should never get the electrical portion of the charger base wet, Oral-B has designed the base with a removable top, which can then be cleaned under running water.  To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  After cleaning the removable portion, you can wipe the bottom portion of the base with a dry cloth.  To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  She has been using it regularly and has given me the following pros and cons for this Pulsonic model:Pros******- Extremely slim and lightweight.- Comfortable to hold and is well balanced- Very quiet operation- Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth & gums- Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth & gums- Easy to use and clean- Perfect size for travel- Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work- Charging base takes up very little space on the countertopCons*******- Charging base slides around countertop too easily- No low battery warning indicator- No indication of when charging is complete- Spare brush storage is not covered- No travel/storage case includedMy wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  She has stayed away from power toothbrushes in the past because she didn\'t like the fat handles, noisy operation, and uncomfortable brush heads.  Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  She doesn\'t like leaving the brush heads exposed, so she keeps the spares in a drawer, due to the lack of covered brush storage on the base.  She also wishes that the charging base was weighted, so that it wouldn\'t slide around on the counter so easily.  She informed me that she wants the base mounted to the wall so she doesn\'t have to continue dealing with it sliding around.Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife\'s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B\'s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  I was very tempted to give this Pulsonic toothbrush a 5-star rating, but I honestly feel that Oral-B has overlooked a few important details that will hopefully be corrected on future model releases.  First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don\'t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  The charging base either needs to be weighted or should have better griping foot pads to prevent it from sliding all over the place.  And why they don\'t have a low battery indicator on this toothbrush is anyone\'s guess.  Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  Since the Pulsonic is the perfect size for travel, including a travel case would make perfect sense.  Hopefully they will at least offer a Pulsonic travel case, as an optional accessory, in the near future.  My wife and I consider the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush a 4 and 1/2 star product, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powered brush but doesn\'t want the typical fat-handled, noisy products that have always been the norm."

I\'ve used an Oral-B for almost 10 years.  I get many compliments on my smile, even from strangers.I debated between this model and the lower model, opting to purchase this one because of the readout and extra brushing mode.  Honestly I could have saved the extra money and easily done without the added features.  The Whitening mode just makes the motor pulse in a different pattern - quite irrelevant as far as whitening your teeth.  As for the readout, it looks nice, is water resistant,  and has a clock built-in that displays when not brushing one\'s teeth.  I find I don\'t really look at it other than for the clock.

This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.The one positive thing is the toothbrush\'s compactness.

The cost is there though for the initial toothbrush system and I\'m sure replacement heads are equally as expensive so it may not be worth it if you brush often.You do leave with a somewhat polished feeling so it\'s worth a try at least if you\'ve never used a power brusher. It really depends on how much money you want to invest in your teeth. If you\'re like me you\'ll like it but it\'s probably not worth it in the long run."

I\'ve used the brush a few times already, and I really do feel like my teeth are smoother and cleaner than when using a manual toothbrush.

The only other electric toothbrushes I have used have been lower end models and they are not even in the same league as this toothbrush.  I use this with the Floss Action brush heads and my teeth feel great after.I bought this when Oral-B was having a 50% rebate so I paid only $50 for it.  Killer deal at that price.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the 4000 series is a much better buy.  It is definitely not worth it to pay any extra for the stupid Wireless SmartGuide; it\'s completely useless. Go with the 4000 which is the same unit and you will be much happier.

I had been using traditional toothbrushes which also had heads that seemed too large for my mouth.The first time I used the Oral-B Vitality I felt as if I had just come from the dentists office. My gums were bleeding and slightly tender.This is not a bad thing! Plainly put,the toothbrush delivered an efficient clean. My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.Since I keep the toothbrush in my bedroom (not enough outlets in the bathroom) I charge it only every other night.  It seems to hold the charge for the nights I forget to plug it in. Nice to know if I go on a business trip and leave the charger behind.While it gets into the crevices in my teeth, flossing should still be a separate step for getting in between the teeth."

After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.-----THE GIST OF IT---------I\'m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that\'s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn\'t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It\'s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn\'t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn\'t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It\'s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.-----ENDING------Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won\'t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won\'t do it.  They\'ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.Lastly, I don\'t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes."

I decided to try it again thinking that improved technology might make it bearable.  This one comes with atimer so you know how long you brush each quadrant of your mouth.  Two minutes is what is recommended by dentist, I can go over 4 minutes and longer when I have time.  My teeth feel so clean and appear whiter after each use.

The price here is similar to what you can find it on sale for at your local store but I always forget to buy it when I\'m out so this four pack is convenient.

Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price. So I asked myself, \'How bad can they be\'?The brush heads I received looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense). When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example. On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth). These brush heads have very poor motion constraint. The circular brush can easily \'slide\' around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).Not only that, but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing. As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \'knock-off\', more interested in looking like the original than acting like it.My advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads. Your mouth and your dentist will thank you."

Why it took so long for me to buy an electric or battery powered toothbrush is beyond me. However, I\'m glad I finally woke-up and bought this \'Oral-B Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\', I\'ll never buy another manual toothbrush again.It\'s a Great Toothbrush. Buy it, you won\'t regret it.It comes as advertized with two AA batteries, just plug them in and you\'re ready to go. It has a neat 2 minute timer, which by the way is a long time when you actually start brushing. And that\'s a good thing.I got one tiny, insignificant gripe, it\'s hard to see the (+ -) battery polarity on the side of the toothbrush after removing the battery cap. When I installed the batteries the first time it wouldn\'t start, so I had to switch the batteries around, and now I have to remember the correct installation the next time I add new batteries. It\'s nothing to lose sleep over.Speaking of battery caps, removing the batter cap may be a slight problem for those people who suffer arthritis of the hand but it\'s do-able. You have to \'squeeze hard\' the two rubber spots on the sides, at the bottom of the toothbrush to release the battery cap. With that said, that too can be a good thing, because that means the battery compartment is airtight and waterproof.The ON/OFF switch is covered in some type of rubbery, waterproof membrane and is very responsive; quick on, quick off. The brush itself has a nice weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. Has the right amount of balance as well.The handle is made of two types of materials: rubber and a very smooth plastic, there\'s enough rubber on the handle so you don\'t have to worry about it slipping from your hands, even when wet. The package doesn\'t mention anything about what type of bristle comes with this toothbrush (i.e., soft or hard bristle), however, I felt NO irritation or discomfort what-so-ever.The overall length is 8-inches; brush head length is about 2.75-inches, width of the handle is about 1.5-inches X 1-inches.There are four different styles of toothbrush refill heads available for the \'Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\':1)Oral-B \'Precision\' Clean Brush Head (which comes with this toothbrush)2)Oral-B \'Pro White\' Replacement Brush Head3)Oral-B \'Dual Action\' Premium Power Toothbrush Head4)Oral B \'Floss Action\' Brush HeadI plan on stocking up on all 4 refills. I have all 32 of my teeth and I plan on keeping all 32 teeth, for as long as I can. And this battery powered toothbrush will definitely help me do that."

But lately, I\'ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \'bristles\' and how they\'d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I\'d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I\'ll be certain to purchase this model again.  Goodbye, Reach!"

I went to ConsumerReports, and the ones they really liked were pretty expensive, so Istalled, and then forgot about it.  This time my hygienist broke downand recommended the Vitality, which I found for less than $30.  I wasvery glad to see that this generation of electric brushes doesn\'trequire a big box, just a small recharger.The instructions were a bit confusing, and there was no clearindication of there being a timer or how to use it.  The word \'timer\'is printed near the on/off switch, however.  The first time I used thebrush I was about 75% done when the brush pulsed for a second. Ithink that\'s the \'timer\'.  That has continued to happen every time Ibrush with it.  I\'m pleased to know that apparently I\'ve been brushingmy teeth for well over two minutes all along.Update 5/7/12:  After more than six months I can say that my teeth andgums are definitely healthier.  My hygienist announced that I have atruly clean mouth.  I actually enjoy using this product.It\'s definitely easier to use than a manual brush  It\'s convenient,and came with an extra brush head.  I\'ve now switched to the extra sensitive several days, so one could just leave the charger behind for briefbusiness or weekend trips.

Consumers are depressed and clenching tighter to their dollars. Companies need innovations in their products in order to stimulate more sales. I get it. However, simply miniaturizing a perfectly good product (like the full-size SonicCare) without adding more values is hardly worth anyone\'s time or money. What is more unnecessary is to sacrifice performance just to make something more, to quote another reviewer, \'aesthetically pleasing\'. When it comes to my dental health, thanks but no thanks, I will take performance any day over form. Compared to the other brushed I have used, this tiny brush definitely feels less effective. Don\'t get me wrong though, this is not a horrible brush. Had I never used any other electric toothbrushes before, I probably would be satisfied with this brush just fine. But after using/reviewing a number of different brushes from Vine program, I\'m used to that more powerful and super fast cleaning offered by the full-size models. In fact, I don\'t mind - and actually prefer - that slightly weightier feel of other brushes in my hand. Mind you, I do travel quite often, but the old brush fits my suitcase just fine."

1512,1548,20090913,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 13, 2009",AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"At last, an alternative to Sonicare","Sonicare and Oral-B are the two largest manufacturers of high-end powered toothbrushes. They initially entered the market using very different technologies: ultrasonic vibration for Sonicare, rotary brushes for Oral-B.Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces. They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task. The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges. At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B\'s rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.Sonicare\'s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system. The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled. These brushes are sold under the FlexCare moniker.After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare. I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare\'s. I don\'t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied. This may actually be a good thing since you\'re supposed to only apply it gently.Oral-B includes a feature similar to what Sonicare calls the \'quad-pacer,\' essentially a timer that signals you when it\'s time to switch quadrants (every 30 seconds)Battery life is about a week.Included in the package: brush, charging stand, bonus interstitial brush... but no travel case.PROS----- a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets- very low price for this technology- easy to clean- small charging stand- small brush, great for little hands- quad pacer- setting for sensitive gumsCONS----- may be too small for some hands- charger is 110V only (you need a transformer, not just an adapter, to use it overseas)- no travel caseCONCLUSION----------Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes. At less than half the price of the cheapest FlexCare, the Pulsonic is worthy of your consideration. Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don\'t move the brush back and forth, don\'t push hard: just hold it in place and let it do its job. You will get the best results if you rinse with Listerine and floss before brushing."

It uses the same heads and oscillates almost as fast but costs a lot less. The batteries seem to last for a while but you could try using rechargeable batteries. One of the best features is the circuitry that boosts the voltage of your batteries as they age in order to keep the motor speed constant.

No big deal, right?  Well, then, why not get the description right?  I am disturbed by false advertising, even at the level of how many brush heads are included; makes me wonder what else is wrong in the description.2. The door to the battery compartment on the SmartSense unit is very hard to remove.  It slides about an eighth of an inch and then you have to pick it off.  That is very unclear and the manual does not give directions on how to remove it without breaking it.  If you have any problems with your fingers, you may not be able to get it open since it requires a lot of force to move the back that one eighth of an inch.  That is a problem, especially since the SmartSense unit is one of the reasons this unit is so expensive.  I went to the Oral-B website to find a solution for this problem and there was none.  The website is purely a marketing site.This product is advertised with great features, and others have given it good reviews.  It had better be great or this is one customer who will take advantage of the 60-day money back guarantee."

I examined every part of the toothbrush to see where it could have come from, and eventually rinsed out this tiny little hole towards the top of the toothbrush (which I had never noticed or thought about before) and found, to my horror, that it was absolutely filled with disgusting mold. You know those scenes in lowbrow comedies where a character finds out that they\'ve eaten something disgusting, and desperately try to clean out their mouth until they feel better? Yeah, the scene that followed was kind of like that.Maybe I missed something in the instructional booklet (and I DID read it,) but I had no idea I should be on the look-out for mold in such a random place in my toothbrush. A Google search has shown me that a lot of people have the same problem, and they fix it using things like bleach, hotel towels (\'Because it\'s too revolting to even use my own towels on it\') and an independently-created product that attempts to seal the stupid little hole.Personally, I\'m not going to use a hygiene product that can cause way more harm than good. I\'m going to give Oral-B the benefit of the doubt by being open to the idea that MAYBE this problem is avoidable with most electric toothbrush designs, but I still think it\'s really irresponsible to not at least include a note in the packaging that explains proper cleaning procedures."

The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference is in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. I personally wouldn\'t buy from Amazon because it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off may be similar in quality.I bought several different brush heads from Amazon this Christmas, and all appear to be fakes.

Put simply, his orthodontist bills will be horrendous. And while he still hates to brush his teeth, I can feel confident that the dental bills won\'t outstrip the orthodontist. The two-minute timer is especially helpful for everyone, as Son knows when he\'s done and I can listen for the toothbrush to signal rather than digging up yet another destroyed kitchen timer.

Anyway, I certainly can\'t seen any harm in trying one and after just a few days of use so far, I\'m already beginning to think it was a worthwhile decision.The Oral-B 3000 is easy to use, feels reasonably solid in hand, and is simple to keep clean (it\'s nice that the brush can be removed quickly to rinse out). I was a little nervous the first time I tried it, expecting bleeding gums or soreness, but in fact the opposite has been true. Because there\'s no need to scrub hard, it\'s actually quite gentle, though the sensation is a little strange at first and it took me a few tries to get used to it. I felt it was really getting my gum-line clean, and because they recommend just two minutes (30 seconds per \'quadrant\') I was actually more aware than I usually am with a regular toothbrush about reaching every corner of my mouth and teeth... I guess with no \'instructions\' and years of just using a normal toothbrush, it\'s sometimes easy to forget what we learned as children when it comes to brushing our teeth!So, I\'m happy so far. My mouth and teeth have never felt so clean immediately after brushing (note, that \'clean\' feeling of course quickly disappears once you eat again), though the way the device vibrates against my jaw is a little perturbing, but I\'ll just have to get used to that. I\'d have liked to have seen a few more brush heads supplied with the product as I feel those will get expensive. I noticed the Oral-B site mentions this product coming with four different brushes, but the package states that we only get the one. There appear to be a variety of different brushes available, but I\'m not sure how useful they all are... I\'ll probably stick to just the original one as it already does a better job than a regular brush at polishing my teeth, and I\'m not sure how well the other ones would work. There is one brush with two heads though, that could be interesting to try and might clean even better. Fortunately, these replacement heads are not horribly expensive online, despite being considerably more than a normal toothbrush and lasting about as long. Still, it\'s a small price to pay for that \'clean teeth\' feel, I think."

It produces a STRONG vibration...VERY strong.  Not for the young child or the sensitive mouth.  I seriously felt like I\'d put a power drill into my mouth!That being said, I\'d have to say it is worth the uncomfortable feeling (which I\'m starting to get used to) -- even after just the first use, my teeth looked shiny and polished, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  And despite the strong vibration, I didn\'t have any issues with my gums bleeding.  I think it just takes some getting used to, especially if, like me, you\'re not used to using a power toothbrush.So I would say that the only downside is that you can\'t control the level of vibration -- it\'s either on or off.  Sometimes it would be nice to turn it down a bit (especially in the morning...though I guess it\'s an effective way to wake up!).  ;-)  Adjustable power levels would make this a 5-star product.  It would also be nice if it had an indicator light that tells you when it\'s fully charged or charging."

I like this feature.  Also, if you tend to brush too firmly a little red light flashes on the LCD screen and the pulsation of the brush stops.Con:  You\'ll also receive a timer that reminds you when to move to a different quadrant of your mouth; a useless gimmick for an adult, in my opinion.Response:  I am an adult and I still love this feature.  It is very easy not to brush your teeth long enough especially if you are in a hurry.  The timer doesn\'t allow this to happen.Now, some extra PROs:Previously I was a diehard Philips Sonicare user for many years.  But, I was having some problems with my gums and deep plaque buildup.  I finally decided that there must be something better and more effective.  After much research online and with my dentist\'s input, I decided on the Oral-B.  I absolutely love the deep cleaning feature and brush head.  Actually, I never use any other head or brushing strength other than the deep cleaning mode and brush head.  The brush head has numerous styles of bristles that accomplish different things from deep cleaning, removing plaque, cleaning between teeth, massaging gums, etc.  You couldn\'t give me my Philips Sonicare back.My original hesitance was the price.  But, it was worth the money considering I only have one set of teeth and gums.One minor CON:  The user manual was not written to be user friendly.  It does a poor job of explaining how to set the Smart Guide Clock features.  Just be prepared to read it carefully and keep it nearby for a few days.  When you consider all of the awesome features, the user manual is not worth losing a start or a half star."

2633,2697,20120328,B003UKKHB4,4,"March 28, 2012",AT1A4VABGBB2H,Oral-B and Periodontal Disease!,"Hello All,I figured I would finally rate the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush now. I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this product.First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910. This electric toothbrush was great. I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare. My only gripe was the replacements are a bit on the pricy side. Moving on, I decided to replace the Sonicare (gave to my wife) with the Oral-B 3000. My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line. Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.As an owner of both, I find them similar in a sense, that they are both out (the toothbrushes of course) to perform the same job. The Sonicare did its job just fine. However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch. Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it\'s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.Onto the Oral-B. This brush has performed great. The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease) so I don\'t bleed as much. The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare and I really see no difference other than the size of the head. Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean). I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip. Although, it\'s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work. Plus, I always rinse the brush afterwards with hot water.The battery life appears to be great. I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days. The vibration and strength is great the company claims (40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute). The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \'off\'.The toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation. The build quality seems good to me. I have dropped this toothbrush three times over the span of three months and the electric toothbrush survived without any visual damage or cracks.The charging does take quite some time until it is fully charged. However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night. Therefore, the brush has hours of charging before its next use. One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG. This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first. Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit. Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don\'t even really notice it.In closing, I like this toothbrush. I gave it four stars because while I think it\'s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let\'s face it, it\'s a toothbrush right? Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road). Both the Oral-B and the Sonicare, have their difference. But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease. I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I do.And remember, I do NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can\'t go wrong either way."

Talk about professional, Oral-B wasn\'t kidding when they named this toothbrush.I researched, on consumer reports and feedbacks, and was torn between this Oral-B toothbrush and the UV Sanitizer Sonicare.  They were both rated highly, but had an older version of a Sonicare for 6 years that putter out.  So I opted for this new Oral-B, and what a pleasant surprise!The coffee stains on the backside of my teeth that the Sonicare couldn\'t get, are disappearing w/this toothbrush.  Although it could be said that the Oral-B\'s smaller toothbrush head makes you brush longer (Sonicare\'s toothbrush head is larger) and or reaches hard to clean areas. Either way, the stains are going away now since I brush a Minimum of 4 minutes 2 X\'s a day (w/Sonicare I brushed the standard 2 minutes 2X\'s a day).Thanks Oral-B!

I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  I brush twice a day, on and off with Seonsodyne Whitenting and Sensodyne Pronamel. I also ensured that I used the \'Whitening\' brush setting that the toothbrush offers. Between the two photos, I noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not very much.  My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  So I\'d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  It would probably be nice to have it your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don\'t expect too much.  It might be somewhat of a gimmick that it \'whitens\' teeth, but if you look at what the item is called--Pro White, it is designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth and make them a little whiter.

Even on the gentlest settings, it made my teeth vibrate in an uncomfortable way.Years ago I wrote an article comparing different toothbrushes and toothpastes. I asked several dentists if they had any preferences. One thing I was told by two dentists is that electric toothbrushes are bad, because people tend to brush too hard when using them, ruining the protective enamel on their teeth.Well, I like to judge things for myself, so I did get one, an Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush. And I like it. I\'m careful not to press down too hard when I use it, and I don\'t believe it\'s harming my teeth. I\'m not as confident about that with the Pulsonic. I also prefer the battery-operated Advance over something that takes up more space around the sink and takes up an outlet. I get compliments for how white my teeth are, and I think the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is partly responsible.The Pulsonic is probably a better toothbrush, but considering the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is just $14.99 and does the job for me, I can\'t say it\'s worth the difference."

I do not, however, like the pro white heads that came with the brush. I bought the precision clean heads and love those. They are made to work with the Vitality. This is only packaged and called the Vitality Pro White because it\'s the vitality model with pro white heads... Any heads made for Oral-B will work with this except for the Sonic heads.This brush is great, although it seems it\'s a bit underpowered. When brushing my back teeth and trying to get behind the tooth the motor isn\'t as powerful as it you were just brushing the front teeth but it\'s fine it still does the job just fine. I leave the brush on the charger when not in use so I can\'t attest to how long the battery lasts. Oral-B says that it will last 20 minutes or about 10 2-minute brushing periods. I personally think that\'s low for a modern electronic toothbrush but I leave it on the charger so I don\'t have to deal with a low battery.I brush at minimum 3 times a day. Usually more. I contacted my dentist asking if it was bad and she said that it\'s fine and I told her I was using the Vitality and she said that it was no problem, \'brush as often as you\'d like\'.. So I\'m not worried about gum recession or ruining my tooth enamel with it.I moved from a manual brush to the electronic brush and found at first that the vibrating (oscillating?) was making my gums and the tip of my nose tickelish. I\'ve gotten used to it and it doesn\'t seem to affect me like that anymore.I do drool a lot when brushing and the toothpasty drool goes down the handle on the brush and makes the handle a mess, so I rinse it off half way through and after brushing. The brush is completely waterproof, although I wouldn\'t submerge it...So all in all I really love this brush and rate it a 5/5. We\'ll see in 6 months how my brushing habits are when I go in for my next cleaning. I try to be very thorough and usually brush at least 3 minutes to make sure I get every nook and cranny so if I have tartar that is an unusual build-up I\'ll modify this review.I recommend this brush 100%!"

Years ago my dentist recommended Sonicare and I have been a faithful user of them, upgrading when new models came along.  My dental visits have reflected that use.My hygienist prefers Oral-B and we have talked about it over the years.  I wasn\'t persuaded.  Recently Oral-B started a 50% off campaign and with their 60 day return policy I thought I would try them out.I am glad I did.  I very much like this toothbrush and how it works.  It is bigger than my Sonicare Flex, but even so it feels very good in my hand.  I love the smart timer.  While the Sonicare gives you a beep/jar every 30 seconds, you can see your progress with the Oral-B on the timer.  The Oral-B also gives you a jar too.  In fact, this is the one thing I don\'t like about it.  It is too much of a jar, especially at the 2 minute mark.  It is as if your car is about to stall.After two minutes the Sonicare shuts off.  The Oral-B keeps going until you shut it off.  I am finding that I keep on using it for another 30 to 60 seconds.  Now you can select a deep clean cycle of 3 minutes rather than the normal 2 minute cycle, but I find I prefer going through the normal cycle and then concentrating on the areas my dentist has mentioned as needing extra attention for another 30/60 seconds.The brushes seem to be fine.  I have used the ones that came with the package but also the sensitive head.  I like the sensitive head best.  It is a bit more compact and seems to get the job done.I will know how effective it is for me when I next visit the dentist for a cleaning.But for now, my feeling is that I am doing a better job in brushing and concentrating on the problem areas.I am keeping this and sending in for the rebate."

Glide Deep Clean is wonderfully smooth and comfortable, making flossing downright pleasant on both your gums and your fingers. The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you\'ve cleaned.But... It\'s the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest\'s claims of being \'shred resistant\' fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven\'t yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can\'t even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn\'t inspire confidence. At the price premium Crest is demanding, I\'d expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece."

It is so much better than the earlier models that we are glad we chose to replace an older one.  The floss style brushes are very effective and our teeth are much cleaner and whiter.  The only problem has been the splatter--much worse than the previous model we owned

Those do not even compare to this one. Highly recommend anyone thinking of upgrading to dive in. This one tracks how long to brush each quadrant and the motor seems much stronger than our previous Oral-B toothbrushes and does a better job cleaning. Also with the container included you only need one toothbrush for the entire household.

My only criticism is that they are all the same colour - for families it would be useful for each person to have a different colour toothbrush head so they do not get mixed up.  The product is small enough to fit into a standard envelope, but I was sent mine in a cardboard box 30�23�11cm, which annoyed me a great deal.  Aside from the inconvenience associated with it not fitting into my mailbox, using such boxes is very wasteful.  Also, the P&P charge was about $5."

My teeth feel cleaner, and I hope my breath is more pleasant.  It gets the hard-to-remove film from the teeth, and does not require the hard brushing of a regular toothbrush.  The bristles initially felt too hard, but it\'s just a matter of getting accustomed to the toothbrush.Although this toothbrush cleans the teeth well I cannot emphasize enough the importance of continuing to floss between the teeth.  The timer that comes with the device is not necesssary as there is a slight change in speed after each 30 seconds of brushing, but I do find it helpful for me.I keep my brush on the charger, but find it works fine without the charger when I\'m out of town over a week. If you keep it plugged in make sure the brush is seated properly or it will overheat. When used in conjunction with the Oral Breeze Quick Breeze (faucet attachment) it makes for a really clean-feeling mouth. (The Oral Breeze helps to remove food debris from under caps and bridges, and really rinses the mouth well).Floss, brush, rinse, smile!"

That\'s the way I felt after using this toothbrush.I\'ve tried plenty of motorized toothbrushes in the past, from expensive to the cheapies you can grab for six bucks at a supermarket, but I\'ve always returned to a standard manual brush. Not this time, though.The Vitality is really incredible. The included two-brush heads (and you get two of them) have an oscillating section at the top, and a section that goes back and forth beneath it. While one polishes and cleans one tooth, the other is getting between them, almost making floss redundant (I said almost). It even has a timer that goes off after two minutes, pulsating the motor a couple of times to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing.After charging it up for 16 hours (which they say will give you a week of twice-a-day brushing sessions), I followed the manufacturer\'s suggestions for how to use it (yes, I actually read them - all part of the review), and can honestly say no other home toothbrush has ever made my teeth feel so clean.Additional brush heads are available in various styles, though why I\'d ever want anything beyond the two brush style that came with it eludes me (they do make a polishing head though, which I suppose I can understand even if I\'m not personally interested). According to the instructions, each head should last about three months, and with refils costing about four bucks per head (in a package of six), that nets out to about 12 dollars a year for refils: a steal for how well this works.I\'m already buying another for my kids\' bathroom: because it comes with two heads they can each have one (downside: no color coding, so I\'ll use a sharpie to delineate them).A fantastic toothbrush that is at last worth ditching a standard manual brush for, I can recommend this without reservation."

It works really great and battery run time is significantly longer than my brushing time. And the Vitality is completely sealed which is great since I brush my teeth in the shower! After 2+ years though the battery is finally not having as much power and not lasting as long between charges so I put it on the charge every day. But it doesn\'t quite have the power it did when new. All things considered, I have no problem with this rechargeable toothbrush lasting 2-3 years as that is more than I expected. The best part is that Oral-B still makes the Vitality and I can use the extra brush heads that I previously bought on the new Vitality that I just purchased. The brush heads are not cheap, about $20 for 3 so I did not want them to go to waste. I really like the cleaning action from the Dual Clean brush heads and they don\'t seem to be too harsh either.If you are looking for a great, reliable and inexpensive electric rechargeable toothbrush, I highly recommend Oral-B\'s Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush."

The brushes arrived in perfect shape much more quickly than expected.  I would buy from this seller again and give them 5 stars.Dec update: I wish this came in an actual 4 pack. I can\'t use the one that is supposed to clean between your teeth as I don\'t have that much space between my teeth so that one is wasted on me. I\'d rather they had a pack of brushes and a pack of those so that we could purchase only what we actually need.  The brushes however, while harder than I am used to are color coded so that the head can be switched for multiple people to use.  The thing to remember about brushing with these is what I keep in my head every single time, let the brush do the work, otherwise you will be brushing too hard and hurt the enamel on your teeth.  What I really wish is, that I could use the oral b sonic complete brushes with this brush handle, I don\'t understand why they make different brush heads for each of their sonic toothbrushes or barring that, they would actually be consistent in their brusheads, these really should be softer."

Now like I said, I\'ve never used one before, so maybe they\'re all loud.  When I say it\'s really big I mean the base part of the toothbrush that you hold on to.  It\'s very thick/wide and is weird when holding in your hand.  My in-laws have electric toothbrushes that are much thinner, but I don\'t think they\'re as high-end as these.I\'m wondering if the additional thickness is from a better battery in this model because the battery lasts quite a while before you have to recharge it.Overall, I think this toothbrush is very good for even the normal price.

I gave the Floss Action heads a try using the Oral B Vitality motor unit and thought the Floss Action heads weren\'t very good. About a year later, I put the same Floss Action head on an Oral B Smart Series 5000 and it was totally different. I\'d definitely buy the Floss Action heads in the future.The Floss Action heads are similar to the standard Precision heads, but have 4 extra rubber paddles for \'flossing action\'  or removing some stains. With the Vitality brush, the RPMs weren\'t fast enough or the oscillating action was slightly off causing the Floss Action heads to hurt my gums a little. They acted more like bumpers than anything else. With the Oral B 5000, the RPM seemed faster and smoother, and the Floss Action heads felt the same as the Precision heads.I normally floss before brushing, so I cannot comment on whether the Floss Action heads can replace the act of flossing. I still recommend following your hygienist\'s recommendations, which is usually to floss before brushing.It works well at cleaning my teeth, and it is compatible with most Oral B brush motors. However, I recommend you buy an updated unit and not try to use the Floss Action on a Vitality, low-end model, or something made a decade ago. The 4 extra paddles don\'t feel like they\'re doing anything, but I can see them oscillating on my teeth and gums.Overall: 4/5 stars"

Very affordable; it has  a 2 min time built in; a set of 2 AA alkaline batteries last close to 2 months without the loss of speed (some technology built-in do that), but make sure you grease  battery cap o-ring before you close or it will crack after some time (it happened  to me); it lasts  forever  and it does the  same  job as  the  much more expensive Oral-B in the market. Dito.I have posted the same review for the oral-b vitality toothbrush, but it is related to the pro-health model as well.I\'ve been brushing my teeth wih oral-b for over 10 years now, and they are all similar to  the vitality model.  I\'ve  always used the least expensive model since I see no difference from the expensive ones, unless you are looking for \'extras\', like timer, lcd screen, etc. The vitality is a very good brush. I use the round head instead of the elongated.  I rather brush my teeth with oral-b than any other eletric brush on the market. The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well. Oral-B  entry level eletric brushes are the way to  go. I can\'t brush my teeth with regular toothbrush anymore. Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but saty way from the  cheap kind. They are knock-offs  and last less  than a month. The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more. The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings. I think this is annoying. I didn\'t want to leave the brush recharging after every use. So I bought the ORAL-B Pro-Health that uses two AA batteries. It is simply AMAZING. The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better. The batteries lasts forever on the pro-health. I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months. It is the best.  The vitality rechargeable brush gets very slow after 3-4 days. Not with the pro-health. Buy the  pro-health. It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design. Another thing is ORAL-B equipment lasts forever. I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me. And since they are the entry level brushes, I just buy another one of  the same. No need to buy another battery.Again, go with the ORAL-B PRO-HEALTH eletric toothbrush."

The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  The brush itself is cordless, although the cord on the base station would be better served if it were retractable, for space management purposes.  Oral-B claims that the rechargeable battery cannot be \'killed\' by repeated charging, so hopefully that works as advertised.  The package also comes with one replacement head, which is a value-added touch.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.Second, effectiveness.  It\'s equipped with a 2 minute timer, which indicates the suggested total brushing length.  This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner after usage, although not quite on par with visiting a dentist\'s office.  The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.The review merits the deduction of one star, due to head design.  If the head were skinnier and angled, then it could enable better access to teeth in the rear of my mouth. Overall, a very good, entry-level toothbrush from Oral-B."

It is the perfect size for travel.On the negative side are the following:(1) The brush quality.  The brush quality is on-par with my earlier Oral B brush (which now retails for around $35).  Additionally, the brush head is more traditional and I tend to favor the rounded head found on most Oral B brushes.(2) The charging station.  Not nearly the high quality that I would expect.  Made from light-weight plastic, it feels cheap.(3) The price.  This product would be perfectly priced at around $45 and is a bit expensive at close to $70."

The simple reason is that with the smaller head (with just the cicle of bristles), I feel like I have more control and can really get around my back teeth.  This will really boil down to preference for anyone.  I\'m sure both are great at getting your teeth clean.  But for me, I am going to stick with the standard head that comes with the toothbrush."

I visit my dentist every 6 months without fail (yes I have dental insurance and bi-annual cleanings are covered) and I have received nothing but praise from my dentist.I recently switched to this model becauser I became incredibly frustrated with the internal battery models dying 12 to 18 months after purchase. This was not due to mechanical failure as the build quality of this Made in Germany product is solid. However the Ni-Cad batteries cannot sustain charges well after prolonged use. I always disassemble the old brushes, remove the AA battery, and run it through a La Crosse charger using the full charge-discharge cycle which brings the battery back to life. However the disassembly of the brush does not permit for its reconstruction so all I am left with is a rechargeable AA Ni-Cad battery for use in other devices.The great thing about this brush is that it has the same great build quality but costs half the price. Additionally, it takes two AA batteries and the unit goes a week worth of brushing without charging while the internal battery models get 3 days maximum when new which slowly falls to every day before needing charging.In short, you get the same cleaning efficacy at half the cost with extended periods between charges. I am hoping that the product\'s life will also extend beyond 18 months further enhancing the benefits of this model versus any Oral-B/Braun model that can cost 10 times as much!! Seems like a real winner and a no-brainer."

I usually floss at least once  a day after brushing and I am always a little surprised by how little excess debris is present after using this brush.My only complaint with this brush is the relatively short life span before batteries need to be replaced.

1598,1639,20080904,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 4, 2008",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,The new aesthetically pleasing brush,"Before I received the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush I was using the conventional, bulky, sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare).  Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  The Pulsonic is about the same size as a manual toothbrush, which is much smaller than all electronic toothbrushes currently on the market.  This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom (even the charger is not the usual eyesore).  Now to the nitty gritty, what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  Nothing, except unwanted complexities.  The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren\'t familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  This takes the place of the usual multi-button brush with a variety of settings, only one of which you actually wind up using.  The Pulsonic comes with one standard brush head and one precision head that has a brush area about the size of a toothpick and stiffer bristles.  The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  This is designed to help you spend the right amount of time in the four quadrants of your mouth, and has always seemed silly to me, but after using it for a while I am following the routine without even thinking.  The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very \'natural,\' and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter. Overall, the brush does everything a sonic brush should, none of the things I think it shouldn\'t and it takes up less space and looks great.  The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  If you\'re looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B."

If you are used to using a normal toothbrush you will probably hate this thing. It is big which makes brushing more challenging. Getting behind your front teeth almost always leaks toothpaste spit... Also, when using the way the instructions tell you to there is always a glob of un-lathered toothpaste in your final spit out! This tells me that these electronic toothbrushes don\'t work and you are better off with regular old fashioned toothbrushes.

That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that\'s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it\'s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you\'ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It\'s not like they\'ll go stale in the linen closet.Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.Hints:Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you\'re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you\'re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you\'ll do a serious \'eewwww.\'  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.

My husband is so impressed that we purchased extra brushheads for him to try it out and he\'s sold as well.There are three brushing options.  1) regular 2) sensitive 3) whitening.  I tend to always brush on the third level of Whitening.  I really like the light up indicator telling you that you are pressing too hard.  Also, there is a timer that vibrates when you should move to the next quadrant of your mouth.The stand and charger are also a nice perk.  The stand comes with 4 compartments to store the brushheads, as well as the charger stand.

And it\'s really not too bad for $30.First, you have to realize that if you\'re moving from a normal brush you have to re-learn how to brush. No more moving the brush rapidly with your hand - press the button on the handle and it starts whirling at high speed. Press the brush to your teeth and gums and sloooowly move it left to right or right to left. Make sure you get all three sides of top and bottom, and that you get the gumlines - that\'s the most important part. Obviously it doesn\'t really matter what order you do it in, but if I don\'t keep a pattern I get distracted by pets or people and forget. After two minutes the brush will briefly stop the motor a few times to let you know you\'ve brushed enough - next time you can adjust your movement speed to hit that mark.It includes an induction charger - just set the handle on it. You can do it every night or once a week.So how does this $30 model compare to the $90-120 models? Well, the grip is noticably cheaper, with no rubber grip stripes. The induction charger is very easy to tip over compared to the sturdier \'well\' model. There\'s no charge indicator. The whole thing feels a little bit more flimsy than the 8900, though it never felt like it would actually come apart. There\'s no 30 second indicator like the better models, and there\'s only one speed, though I never found the other speeds on the 8900 useful anyhow.All in all not bad for $30 - of course they\'ll get you for $3-4 each for replacement head, but that\'s only every 3 months or so, and this comes with one head and one spare head. And I think you\'ll do a better job with this than with a regular brush - it\'s very easy to pay for itself if you just get one fewer cavity. If you want one of the above features spring for a better model, but this isn\'t bad for 1/3rd the cost."

We\'ve used Oral-B sonic for 5 years, and 5000 for 1 year.Cleanness (draw):- Both cleans well. However, they cannot remove 100% dirt from the teeth, given they use two different ways to clean. (5000 is left-right, and Sonic is up-down). It really depends on where the dirt is hiding. I would say Sonic does a better job to clean the front teeth, and 5000 does a better to job to clean the teeth in the back.Power (5000):- 5000 wins. However, it may take 1 week for your body to adjust to the strong power.Timer (5000):- 5000 comes with a timer, which is very nice.Brush head design (Sonic):- We found that the brush of 5000 wears out much faster than Sonic. I guess it has something to do with the strong power of 5000.- One thing I hate about 5000 is the brush head design. There is a hole below the brush head, which capture the toothpaste when brushing. You cannot remove it without removing the brush head. If you leave the tooth brush standing, the toothpaste inside will get out, and eventually accumulate at the bottom of the brush. This creates a round mark in our sink. To solve this problem, we need to remove the brush head and clean it completely. We didn\'t have this problem with Sonic.Battery power (Sonic)- We don\'t charge the brush until the power is completely drained. Normally, the battery of Sonic lasts about 7 days, while 5000 lasts about 3-4 days. However, it takes about 18 hours to charge Sonic, while it takes less than 12 hours to charge 5000Other uses (Sonic)- We like to use the brush head to clean the tongue. Sonic wins.Overall, we like the Sonic better."

From the first time I brushed with this Oral B 5000, I was astonished at how clean my teeth felt.  I honestly think they felt even cleaner than when I would have them cleaned at the dentist.  I even find myself brushing a third time some days, just for the great feeling.  My only disappointment with the unit is that I didn\'t clearly understand it only came with one brush head.  My husband utilized that Floss Head while I waited a few days for our set of 4 Precision Clean Brush Heads came in.  (I think that the floss head would have been too large for my mouth, so I did not order those for us.)  Using the simple Precision Clean heads, my mouth feels terrific.  While I have had gum problems in the past, I find less bleeding with this brush than my manual toothbrush which I had been using.  As some others have noted, my teeth are markedly whiter in perhaps only a week of use, with my usual whitening toothpaste I will add.  I do like the little remote timer.  I thought it more for my kids, but I truly like seeing the time rack up.  I now think I will be using the Deep Cleaning (3 minute) setting as I am never quite done with each quadrant before it beeps and pauses to alert me.  I am unsure how the whitening (pulsing mode) helps, but I use it after a full brushing, and it certainly isn\'t hurting.  My family of four is now happily using this unit.  I would recommend this without reservation."

Well, I found out what sonic action is,even on the low setting, with very little noise, about a 2 on the 10 scale.I\'m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head) whatever off your teeth,but, if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?I decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional 1000.That\'s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes) cleans all surfaces very well,very quickly because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was over doing.However, the noise for it is about a 4."

This brush does a great job of thoroughly cleaning your teeth w/o hurting your gums.  The timer that directs you to switch from one quadrant to another, every thirty seconds is a good reminder.  And the red light that flashes when too much pressure is applied is quite handy.In addition to switching my toothbrush, I also changed my toothpaste to Jason\'s Healthy Mouth.  After using the new toothbrush & toothpaste for approximately three months, I visited my Hygienist for a cleaning.  Unprompted, she told me that I had the healthiest teeth/gums of any of her patients.  And that assessment still holds true after almost two years.One last note:  If you\'ve got a youngster who needs to learn to brush all quadrants w/o applying too much pressure, purchase an extra toothbrush head and let your child give it a try.

Some brands were so thick, I felt I was trying to shove a thick wedge between my teeth, and never managed to slide them in. Tape types were beyond hopeless in my mouth since the tape twists. The winner for me is Oral B Essentials. Very smooth - perfectly thin. Gets between the teeth with no trouble at all. Quick to do the whole mouth. Never cuts my gums. The floss can shred a little bit, but no worse than any other I\'ve tried, I won\'t bother deducting points for that. Besides all that, it ends up being cheaper than any of the other flosses I was buying - and has just many feet or meters of floss within. What\'s not to like? I hope they make it forever."

Kind of like the old vibrating toothbrushes from long ago, except the power behind this is far greater, and much more effective.Sonicare had the benefit of being first with this type of brush, but Oral-B has an advantage in that they can study the other product and make improvements on it.  I\'d say the major difference is that the Oral-B is thinner, lighter, and therefore easier to hold and maneuver around the mouth.  The replacement brushes are also less expensive on this model, which is important as they can really add up if you replace them as recommended by the manufacturer, every three months or so.I was pleased to see that toothpaste can be used with it, although if you use too much you\'ll be foaming at the mouth from the ultrasonics.  It is still pretty foamy, so I recommend staying close to the sink.The recharging base is small, attractive, and wall-mountable.  The power cord plugs into a wall outlet and doesn\'t use a transformer, so it won\'t take up additional outlets. It will hold two spare brush heads behind the toothbrush, and allows the toothbrush to be dropped in facing any direction.  So, when you are done it is an easy matter to drop the toothbrush back onto its base.It actually worked quite a bit better than I expected.  The head is fairly small, so it is easy to move around your mouth to clean each tooth.  The timer lets you know if you are rushing the job (I usually am, but at least now I can\'t pretend I don\'t know that!).  The massage mode for the brush seems like a feature that I\'ll never use, but people with tender gums that are working their way up to the full speed might like it.  I use mine on clean mode all the time and it works well.  It is somewhat annoying that both modes are accessible through the single button given that I never use the lower-speed.  It isn\'t so annoying that it is a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.I was happy with the noise level, too.  Nothing bugs me more than holding something that sounds like a buzz saw so close to my ear in the morning.  Mercifully, this brush is pretty quiet, as these things go.  It is louder than a manual brush, of course, but quieter than an electric shaver.  The pitch is a little high, but nothing I can\'t live with.Overall, I like it and would get it again.

I got the idea to try to replace the battery but the case has no easy way of opening and my attempt resulted in a shattered case -- it went in my batteries-to-be-recycled bag. I have an Oral-B Vitality I got cheap for under $20 over a year ago because I like to have more than one electric toothbrush (big house). However, it\'s action seemed primitive to me compared to my Sonicares, so I started shopping. Costco has a current coupon on a pair of Sonicares but I decided to look online and see what I could find out and/or buy.I decided on the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 in spite of the fact that there appears to be no rebate available for it at this time. The reasons I decided on the 5000 are several. Firstly, it appears to be not difficult to replace the battery when the time comes. The replacement batteries are easily found on ebay and several of those listings (and other YouTube videos) feature  detailed instructions on how to do the replacement. You do have to use a solder iron, but I\'ve been handy with one since I was a teenager, so no big deal. I would not buy another Sonicare if I thought it might not be possible to replace the battery.Why get the best Oral-B going in spite of the price? I am a frugal guy, extremely so, but in this instance I figure it\'s time to splurge. I have only one set of teeth. The dentist does not scare me, nor the oral surgeon, but I know that the bills can come to literally thousands of dollars. If I obsess a little on my oral hygiene, so much the better! My wallet, teeth, breathe and smile will all benefit! Oh, and my general health. Oral health is a very important part of one\'s overall health.I discovered that the extra brushes I bought for my Oral-B Vitality will work fine with my 5000, cool!The Smart Guide? Well, it\'s OK, it\'s a plus, but no biggie. The biggest advantage of it is if you use more than one mode. It shows you which brushing mode you are using, and it is possible to be in a mode you didn\'t know you were in unless you glance at the Smart Guide. This happened once to me already. I hadn\'t intended to use other than the default mode, but I\'d inadvertently pressed the mode advance button.When I got the 5000, it had no charge and I set it in the charging cradle but nothing happened and I thought maybe the battery was bad. I\'d looked at the instructions on charging but hadn\'t read down to the short paragraph where it says that the battery icon on the handle\'s LCD may not appear for 10-15 minutes the first time you charge it. I still hadn\'t seen that part of the instructions when I got the idea to place the handle in the charging cradle of my Sonicare brush, thinking the Oral-B\'s might be inoperative. Just a second or two in that cradle gave the battery enough oomph to show the battery icon, I then charged it fully in the Oral-B\'s cradle and everything\'s been fine since.The Sonicares I had would pulse briefly every 30 seconds and turn off after 2 minutes. The Oral-B does the every-30-second pulsing, but keeps on going when the 2 minutes is up. I like the fact that the Oral-B keeps on going and lets me decide when I want to turn it off.I picked up mine off ebay for about $12 less than the lowest price I\'ve seen here. The price here has varied by about $10 (i.e. 10%) just over the last week. If I were in no hurry I\'d have waited for another 50% off rebate offer, however.You have to insert the brush in your mouth before turning it on so as not to spray toothpaste all over.  Likewise, you have to turn it off before removing it from your mouth. After doing that, I place it under running tap water, and while holding it under the stream of water I turn on the brush for a few seconds and let it clean itself of toothpaste, then turn off the tap leaving the brush running for a few more seconds to let it shake off most of the water so it will dry quickly.I\'ve always brushed before flossing. I always use a dental pick as well (strongly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist, it\'s the end of a round toothpick, held in a handle called the \'perio-aid 3\', given me by my dentist). A couple of days ago I started wondering if I should really brush first and did an Internet search on the subject and found out that brushing is recommended to come last because dislodging plaque from the tooth/gum-line gives your fluoride toothpaste access to the tooth surfaces, re-mineralizing those surfaces, making them more resistant to decay. So, now I\'m brushing last."

Someone else noted that if that the brushes are coming off, then chances are you are applying too much pressure. Hopefully the rebate will come through without any hassles. The actual head does not move much in motion, just vibrates, but I guess that must be the \'sonic\' part. Not used any sonic brushes before. Slim size and small head makes it easy to glide around your mouth."

The first few daysI used it, it felt like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  My teeth felt smooth and clean.  This is a awesome toothbrush, small round bristle head is better than the sonicare long shaped one, becuase you pay more attention toeach tooth and it\'s really fast and easy to use and brush.  Now I look forward to brushing everyday and I also brought one for my wife and three kids.Update:  I went to costco and they had the same tooth but a professional version, which cost more money and works the same.  My recommendation is that if you can afford it then get the professional version or if not, this one works just as fine and maybe even better since it saves you money."

I don\'t know if newer Sonicare toothbrushes have a different design. I used the Sonicare Elite for many years until the nickel-cadmium battery died. I didn\'t notice the inferior design of the Sonicare until I started using the Oral-B 5000. The Sonicare has fat plastic at the brush end which is not as comfortable as the slim Oral-B brush head. The Sonicare has a fat and elaborate interface between the base and the removable brushing unit, which is not as easy to keep clean as the slim and simple interface of the Oral-B. And the Oral-B brushing part of the two types of brush included in the box does a better cleaning job. Finally, we have battery disposal. The Sonicare has a non-removable Ni-Cad battery, so that in order to dispose of it properly at a recycling center I had to cut the base to access the battery. The Oral-B has a provision for removing the nickel-metal hydride battery (better than Ni-Cad), although the manufacturer wants you to stop using the unit when the battery dies, not to replace it."

I\'m also concerned that some of the power brushes are too powerful - my teeth get sensitive. After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I\'ve been doing pretty well with the cheap Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary). Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.It\'s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it\'s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn\'t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that\'s it. I think that when the battery dies it\'s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn\'t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don\'t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn\'t a concern for me. I\'m planning to buy this brush for my children to try. For an entry level power brush, this is a solid choice."

False advertising...you decide!  Also I would like to talk to the engineer that designed the AC plug.  The plug is huge...what were they thinking!  The brush itself is much nicer than my old Oral-B 3D...there\'s much more to it and fits your hand perfectly.  I also have to agree that it takes a little bit of effort to get the backing off of the Smart Guide.  I think the trick is that you have to have it laying in your fingertips while you push with both thumbs.  It seems getting it off initially is the greatest problem but it does come off easier after the initial opening.

I prefer the oral-b / braun non-sonic over the sonic models. I am a big fan of this style of toothbrush & have owned them for almost two decades. I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years) and this one is my favorite. The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \'brake light\' which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums. Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \'get all up in there\', but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful. I buy the \'extra sensitive\' heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I\'m not \'paying attention\'. Even though the other models had an \'indicator\' (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn\'t really enough to get my attention so I didn\'t reduce the pressure.When I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light - it\'s *really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall. (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom). But, the \'brake light\' was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and the light now only goes on every once in a while.They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing. This toothbrush with its \'brake light\' feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums & your teeth, and in turn, your health & well-being!PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, & healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon). I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)"

The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth. After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning. The brush is also smaller and requires you to use less toothpaste, which will result in savings over time. The only downside is that the brushes are a little on the pricey side, but I\'m hoping they last longer than my regular brush.If you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush.

It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue you can put it on soft mode. The charger you see in the picture can actually come apart so you are left with a tiny stand if you want instead of the big face. The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist saying \'you\'re brushing your teeth too hard\' which can be very bad for you. Finally the cost. You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning. My mouth was a little sore but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \'I bet you haven\'t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\' I actually told him that wasn\'t true...I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing. My teeth feel the same as going to a dentist (plus I floss twice a day), every day..what more can you ask for.Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes... you get what you pay for period.

Other than the addition of the two minute timer, this looked exactly like my old brush; the sale was so good that I bought several of them.  Now I know why they were on sale!  My old brush without the timer worked just fine for several years with yearly battery changes.  After only 2 months of use, the timer function on this new brush keeps kicking in after barely 10 seconds of operation instead after 2 full minutes as stated on the package!  To do a thorough job cleaning my teeth, I have to turn the brush off and wait at least 30 seconds before turning it back on only to have the same problem reoccur after only 10 seconds or less.

I am able to eat with relative abandon again (after getting braces) once I learned how to use the SmartSeries 5000 properly and in a systematic way.The SmartSeries 5000 (with an ortho brush head and power tip attachment) has made brushing and cleaning with braces on extremely easy and a no-brainer.The kit includes a handy travel case (with holders for two attachments), lightweight charger, and timer which links wirelessly to the toothbrush.I usually start with the power tip which is very effective in cleaning debris around brackets and between the wires.  To clean with the ortho brush head, simply press it in front of each tooth and count slowly to twelve -- going from the rear molars to the front teeth on each side on both top and bottom rows of teeth. After that, just brush the biting surfaces and rear of the teeth.Overall, the kit components were very useful to me except for the timer.The timer would display a ring which represented the top and bottom rows of teeth.  The ring was split into four sections and the timer would indicate the amount of time needed for each quadrant of teeth.  It was somewhat tricky to clean by the quadrant and just easier for me to use a fixed count for each tooth."

By way of full disclosure, I have been using the Oral B Cross-action toothbrush for a number of months, and in the past I used a Sonicare toothbrush.For whatever reason, I keep seeing more and more electric toothbrushes lately, each of which is supposed to be the \'latest and greatest\' design.  Frankly, I can\'t see the difference between many of them.  Maybe there are incremental changes that make them worth the sometimes excessive cost, but who knows?  And of course, manufacturers seem to be pretty generous with dental offices, which seem to either display the Oral B brand or Sonicare, or both.  But I suspect that the results between the various brands are pretty similar.This toothbrush is very similar to my Cross-action, the key differences being (i) it lacks the cross action brushes below the oscillating head, (ii) it has a 2 minute timer, and (iii) it\'s rechargable.  Frankly, I prefer the cross-action brushes, but that\'s not crically important.  I do really like the 2 minute timer, and the fact it\'s rechargable.  It does a good job cleaning, and the timer is a nice feature.From my perspective, I don\'t think that the brushes that sell for $70+ are worth the money.  Far from it.  The Cross action does a fine job on my teeth, and this brush is pretty comparable, with the added plusses of being rechargable and having the two minute timer.  So I think this is a good buy for the money, and I would recommend it.  I also like the fact that there are a variety of different heads available for it, including ones that floss, are gentle, etc.I\'d say that this brush is a very good value for the money."

Prior reviewers have already commented on the power converter that sticks 3 inches out from the electrical wall plug - duh. Also the enigma of how to open the battery compartment of the \'Smart Guide Display unit\'. (TWO covers to be removed with gorilla fingers, sliding each in opposite directions.)Fortunately the rechargeable (Ni-MH) battery in the handle can be replaced (compared to the older Braun models that became useless once the battery died), but how to change the battery is a deeper mystery. (Amidst the very poorly written instructions, the section for replacing the rechargeable battery provides only a small diagram that is utterly unintelligible.) I went to the [...] website and clicked on \'email us\', but what a bad joke that was - I just ended in an endless search option in their FAQ section. Next I\'ll call them at [...].Oh, then you have to remember twice a year to not use the battery charger, so that the battery discharges completely in order to \'maintain the maximum capacity of the rechargeable body\'. (Since a full charge is claimed to last at least 10 days, I suppose one then turns on the toothbrush and leaves it running on the bathroom counter... hoping the internal moving parts don\'t wear out in the process.)CRITICAL: In these days of airline security concerns, if you bring the toothbrush with you (as my dentist recommends), DON\'T FORGET to deactivate the radio transmitter that is built into the toothbrush handle (to communicate with the \'Smart Guide display unit\').In summary: This is a fabulous toothbrush (10x better than my previous Braun model) but a disaster on the \'user friendliness\' scale. I can only hope that in the next few years Braun\'s competition will \'eat their lunch\' with something yet better and much simpler to use!"

I mean, it\'s a toothbrush after all. WRONG. Once you\'ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you\'ll never go back.Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  Always have.  Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  However, I went ahead and gave it a try.In less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  I put on the toothpaste and away I went.  The best thing is the size of the rotating head: it\'s about the size of a tooth.  Gee: what a novel idea! As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  This allowed me to work on my teeth while moving towards my gums.  In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.One of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth. This was something I could NEVER do with a regular toothbrush.  I also have some very deep pockets in my gums that have a tendency to hurt and bleed. However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  Oral-b is a reliable brand and this is in keeping with the brand recognition.  I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  It\'s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera! ;)"

As I could not find more details from other reviews (maybe I missed) based on how I plan to use it. I\'ll focus the review on that front. I thought the SmartGuide is very helpful as the kids can clearly see the progress and stay on the brushing until 2 min. is reached. I\'m glad to report that it works as planned perfectly. As an adult, it is easier to manage the discipline on how long you should brush your teeth. However, my kids constantly want to get off the process and it is painful to calm them down and persuade them to go further. With the SmartGuide clearly showing the progress and how far you are away from the \'smiling face\', it helps managing the expectation excellently.Now get the details on how the SmartGuide works for our use. Each 5000 comes with one SmartGuide, and you can use just one for more than one toothbrushes. However, the manual also provides you instructions on how to make each SmartBuide dedicate to individual toothbrush if it is what you desired. I bought two together, and found that both SmartGuide will respond to signal coming from each toothbrush as the way I received them. Since I don\'t want to put two SmartGuides in one bathroom, I don\'t need to reconfigure anything.The SmartGuide function is very simple. It automatically receive the signal from the 5000 toothbrush as you start brushing. If you stop in the middle, the time counting will pause then resume when you continue. If you wait longer, (not sure exact, maybe 30 sec or longer), it will reset itself. Everything is automatic, there is no manual button to start or stop time counting, therefore it can not be a timer for anything else besides 5000. For the extra SmartGuide that I do not plan to put in the same bathroom with the toothbrushes, I use it as a clock in the other bathroom; it looks nice though.I don\'t have much to say on other fronts. Overall, it is an excellent purchase for young children.Charlie"

It is a very nice design and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because it doesn\'t sit firmly in the base and is easy to knock it out of the base, it wobbles when bumped lightly. I also feel the brush head could be slightly smaller but the size is OK, I just like the smaller brush heads. It says the charge will last for about 4 hours which is good since brushing teeth only takes about 2 minutes. This is a very nice pulsing toothbrush for a little less money than some that works well. (there is a card inside that says about a survey and a $10 prepaid as a reward but this must be an older box, the survey can not be found)"

Oral B is lower  in price and seems to do the same job Great thing about Oral B is it\'s very lightweight, easily packed for travel and offers a large variety of replacement brushes. The brush itself was harder than I\'d like but they do offer softer ones for those with sensitive teeth. They also offer a brush for those with braces, implants, crowns and bridges. It\'s a bit pricey and I bought it. Once I check it out, I\'ll write a review on that separately. Overall, a reasonably priced product, lightweight. The battery is built in, so you will need to recharge accordingly, most likely once or twice a month. My only gripe is that there is no cover for the brush."

I am still using the head on my toothbrush... only because I can\'t afford another one right now.

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  The number after the dash (for example EB17-3) just means how many toothbrush heads you\'ll be receiving.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads."

She recommended that I consider buying this Oral-B toothbrush because it could help remove the tea stains.This is an excellent electric toothbrush and it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean after brushing.  The timer and pressure warning feature are nice and the brush is much easier to keep clean than the Sonicare I used to use.  The only negative comment I can think of is that the brush head might be a little big for some people; I found brushing around my back molars a little difficult.

The toothbrush comes with a charger and clock/timer for each of your cleaning sessions. This not only monitors how long you are cleaning, but, has a little red light that is illuminated when you are brushing too hard. What\'s more, once you have reached the two minute mark, a smiley face appears on the digital timer. So helpful! I look forward to following up with my dentist in six months, to track my progress. Once you have been brushing with this toothbrush, diligently, for three weeks, plaque is supposed to diminish.

I also like the different modes that it offers. Honestly, I use the main one the most, but the gum massaging one is a nice one that I use occasionally. The SmartGuide, although not a must-have, is very nice to help you see how long you\'ve been brushing and what section of your mouth you are supposed to be on. My husband also got the same brush, just not with the SmartGuide. He doesn\'t mind that he doesn\'t have one (the Oral-B rep told us over the phone that the model just below this one would still be compatible with the SmartGuide but it isn\'t) but admits that it would be nice. My mouth feels so nice after I brush. I actually used a regular toothbrush the other day after using my Oral-B for a few weeks because I just needed to brush for 30 seconds and run.

I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.While I have no complaints about its power, the fact that it utilizes two cleaning brushes gives it a much larger brushing surface than with the single brush found on my Soniccare.  While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist."

123,124,20110406,B00006ANDK,5,"April 6, 2011",A2XE49TNKZZ2XK,Best Value of Oral-B Sensitive/Extra Soft Brush Heads,"I\'ve been using an Oral-B (Braun) electric toothbrush for the past 8 years and I like the extra soft brush head the best of all the brush head varieties (I\'m a dental hygienist and I recommend the soft toothbrush head to all my patients, it\'s gentle on the gums, yet effectively removes plaque). I found the best value on Amazon by BelowCostJML. They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&H for my whole shipment. (I ordered 5x the item of 6 brushes/ea, so 3 bucks S&H for 30 brush heads).Other sellers came somewhat close in pricing but wanted $7-10 S&H fees, not to mention that some would limit you to 1 item (of 3 brushes)/order. So if I wanted to increase the quantity to get the 30 brush heads I got from BelowCostJML, I would have to literally place the order 10 times and pay the ludicrous S&H cost 10x!I\'m thankful for BelowCostJML\'s fair pricing, including S&H and for their great service! The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time. Very pleased with the service!The product speaks for itself, I\'ve been a satisfied user for 8 years and I personally find it gentler in the mouth than Sonicare [I\'ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque (it\'s just a matter of each individual\'s preference)... I guess the \'difference\' would be equivalent to Pepsi versus Coke if you will (not that I\'m encouraging regular consumption of either): they give you the same overall effect, it just depends which one you prefer best. Hope this helped. Happy brushing (and don\'t forget to floss, too). :-)"

I just started using it and it definitely has some extra power that my old one didn\'t have.  It is a bit loud, so if you have sensitive ears, be warned of that.  It charged fast and is holding its battery power well (I don\'t charge it every time I use it).  I brush for 3 minutes and use the 30 second timers for back, top/bottom, right/left, then the extra minute for my front top and bottom... I thought I would hate the 30 second timer and find it annoying, but turns out its really handy to brush each of the areas long enough.  I haven\'t used the little clock thing as I tend to walk around as I brush, but I imagine it would be good for those adjusting to electric toothbrushes and/or kids.  I also probably won\'t use the extra brush holder as my medicine cabinet doesn\'t have the room.  The travel case will definitely come in handy and the small charger is a nice change from my old clunky one.Pros:*Great clean*30 second pauses and 2 minute longer pause*Small charger*Travel case*Should help your dentist visits!!*Pressure notification (if you are brushing too hard, it gives some warning, but I haven\'t experienced it)*Separate timer would be good for kids or those new to electronic brushesCons:*Louder than my old model*Extra stuff... not sure many people need the brush holder, only some will use the separate timer*New heads are expensive"
1832,1877,20091127,B002HWS9FW,5,"November 27, 2009",A3S5QQTF80HG9W,Excellent toothbrush,"Pro:- It can clean teeth very well. Much better than manual toothbrushes. Much better than Crest Spinbrush. I am very happy to have it.- It takes 2 AA rechargeable batteries. A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks. (it depends on how long your batteries hold the charge). Alkaline batteries last a month. So it is very useful for traveling.- Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken. Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.- If you want to save the environment and you don\'t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans then you don\'t like toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries. It is very hard to remove the batteries from the unit to handle them properly.- This is the least expensive electric toothbrush from Oral-B. But it performs really well.- This toothbrush uses the same refill brushes that other expensive models use. So you get similar result for much less money.Con:- This one does not have a timer. You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.- People reported that this toothbrush lasts from 1 to 2 years. Well, the most expensive (about 9 times more expensive) Oral-B electric toothbrush lasts from 3 to 5 years. If you do not care about other features the expensive ones offers, I think this has more value."

The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  There are no recesses to collect toothpaste, moisture etc., so it is easy to keep clean.  I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...my whole mouth.  It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone. I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \'between\' brush would be a good thing to use. The only change I would make would be to slant the head a bit to enable reaching inside surfaces.  All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...in fact it is still working. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the Sonicare, but for the money, this is the best buy. After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  AND, I do not work for Oral B.  Come on...get real paranoid people...09/10/09:  I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  I have not had this problem.  I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed and I can see where that might create the above mentioned problem.  I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  Just food for thought if trying to decide on this product.  I still love it."

It\'s slim and easy to hold and the brush head is the right size, fits in my mouth nicely, and I like the way it cleans.  I also like the little Precision brush that comes with it.  It does a nice job along the gumline. The noise isn\'t bad either.

1607,1649,20080828,B001CX4JSS,3,"August 28, 2008",A1VUN4JU731CBH,Not sure...,"I have pretty much had and tested them all: The Oral-B Triumph, the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, and now the Oral-B Pulsonic. Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but the Pulsonic leaves me a bit unsure.The design of this brush is very reminiscent of the Sonicare toothbrushes, right down to the stand which always looked different on all the previous Oral-B electric brushes. This design really looks like a stripped-down baby version of the Sonicare.First of, the brush itself is extremely slim and light-weight for an electric brush. So much so that one wonders whether it can actually \'do the job\'. So after charging it the required 12 hours, I tried it out for the first time. I did not find it any different in power than the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, it felt the same.What is different is that the Pulsonic\'s manual instructs the user to move the brush over the teeth in a circular motion, very much like one is supposed to do with a manual brush. I, for one, didn\'t quite like this although I can see the benefit of doing it this way. The Pulsonic has - like the Sonicare and unlike the Oral-B Triumph - a regular (yet contoured) brush head. The shape of such a brush head makes it difficult  to sufficiently cover the entire tooth. One is always either cleaning along the gumline or more towards the bite. Using circular motion prevents that only parts of the teeth are cleaned. Yet - I have been using electric toothbrushes for so long that I have gotten used to not really having to do anything but hold the brush head to the teeth. So this is a change I am not sure I like too much.Also - these rectangular brush heads don\'t seem to work too well for me personally. I have a small mouth and find it difficult to easily brush my teeth with these brush heads, especially the insides of the front teeth. It always feels as if I can\'t quite reach all the surfaces, especially the areas along the gumline, and that leaves me wondering whether I get as complete a cleaning as I should be getting.Philips has tried to address this problem by offering a smaller brush head for the Sonicare, but Oral-B doesn\'t seem to have that. So this is not optimal for me.What I did like about the Pulsonic though is that it comes with a second \'Precision Tip\' brush head. I found this to be a great way to really get into the spaces between teeth and I give Oral-B a big thumbs-up for this one.Lastly, the Pulsonic, like the other models and brands, informs the user audibly when it is time to change to a different \'quadrant\' to be brushed, and when the two minutes recommended brush time are over.All in all this is probably a brush I will take along when travelling - the light weight but equal power output make it perfect for that, but at home I will likely stay with the Oral-B Triumph and its round brush heads. I just feel that these heads reach all areas of my teeth better and also feel more comfortable on the sensitive areas of my mouth."

I have written Amazon reviews for Oral-B products dating back to 2002. I have had very few dental issues in this time although, in fairness, I must also report that I began daily flossing during this time as well, and that may be just as important.This new model is a definite step up from the ancient \'Plak Control Plus\' model that I had been using. It\'s full name is \'Professional Care 3000\' and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument. The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one. Please note that this is not an ultrasonic toothbrush. Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action. The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth very quickly.The 3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button. The first is \'Daily Clean\' which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis. The second is \'Sensitive\' which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth. The third is \'Whitening\' which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \'Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\'The instructions that come with the 3000 recommend that you brush for 2 minutes - no less and no more. To assist you with this, once you turn the brush on it will pulse twice every 30 seconds. If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you\'ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times. To turn the brush off from any mode, just press and hold the on/off button.Built into the 3000 is a \'Hard Brushing Alert\' which is an LED on the handle that lights up if you are pressing too hard. Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth. Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly. The instructions say that the LED is, \'Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\' so apparently there\'s a dental health issue here as well. The brush is very powerful, so it\'s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.The brush comes with a charging stand and covered storage tray that can accommodate 4 brush heads. The storage tray is dishwasher-safe, the charging stand is not."

Upon receiving the product, it did not look anything like the original brush heads that I received with the toothbrush I bought months ago from Amazon. The primary differences were: the bristles were the wrong color(the center green was a darker translucent color instead of the opaque light green), the bristles were splayed out instead of in tight clusters, and the gray logo was much lighter. I chalked this up to maybe changes in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the first brush head I tried did not work at all. I chalked that up to manufacturing defect. The second one worked, but didn\'t quite feel right. I decided to just go with it however, and after a month the brush head became very loose. I saw the other reviews and photos and realized that I had received fake product directly from Amazon.Here is the worst part. I decided to purchase replacement heads from Walgreens retail store. I got home and realized that they were also fake product. So, then I went to Target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine. I was floored to find fake product in a retail chain store as well as at Amazon.So, TLDR buyer beware of fake product when ordering online or shopping at retail. Look at the brush heads carefully before you make your purchase. It seems like there is a major counterfeiting problem right now and it hopefully gets resolved soon."

I am happy with the cleaning that I am getting.2. The brush feels like it is massaging my gums.*Charging*Pros1. This brush is dual voltage and will work both in 110v and 220v areas.2. This base of the brush seems much more stable than my  Sonicare since it is a little wider.*Traveling*Pros1. The brush does include a travel case.2. Since the travel case is plastic, it will be much easier to clean though compared to the cloth Sonicare case I had.Cons1. The travel case is MUCH larger than my old Sonicare.2. The travel case appears that it is more likely to break since the plastic hinge area seems like it can wear down.3. The brush heads do not have a plastic cap to help protect the bristles.  I liked that the Sonicare had this option since I was reassured that nothing dirty was touching the bristles while transporting it.*Operation*Cons1. I could not figure out how to get the brush to offer an audible cue when switching quadrants while connected to the SmartGuide.  It only offers an audible cue when the radio is turned off.*Cost*Pros1. This brush is much cheaper than the latest Sonicare.2. Replacement brush heads are much cheaper than the Sonicare (by about half the price).*Maintenance*Pros1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush heads appears that it will be much easier to clean unlike my Sonicare which always had a lot of buildup that was difficult to clean.Cons1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush head is a relatively small metal rod.  I am concerned that if I drop the toothbrush, this may bend and I would be unable to load any brush heads.2. On either side of the brush, there is a section with a silver coating.  Unfortunately, this stains easily with water stains.  I wish that Oral-B had used something that would help avoid the water stains.Overall, I am content with the brush. I wouldn\'t consider myself a Sonicare convert since this isn\'t perfect either, but I plan on keeping this brush."

My first thought...you just want me to buy a $100+ toothbrush that works just as well as my one at home. Of course, like a fish attracted by something shiny I hopped on the internet to take a look at electric toothbrushes. I probably spent 5 hours reading everything I could on these. A lot of people were talking about the one that has a UV cleaner in it. I call gimmick. Anyways, I ended up with this one and was extremely skeptical.1. The timer is separate from the brush and sits on your counter and has a picture of a smiling tooth on it, kind of hard not to feel like this is a joke2. What the heck, charged this puppy up and waited till after dinner3. Initiate brushing sequence4. Having the handle buzz after 30 seconds to let you know to move to a new quadrant and having it show on the timer is very useful. It makes it seem like it is going by really fast.5. If you brush too hard the handle stops pulsating till you back off. I literally put the brush head on each tooth and just move down, not really doing any real brushing but just letting the vibrations do the work.6. After I spit and rinsed out my mouth, it literally felt like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. They stay smooth almost the entire day depending on what you eat.This was $$$ well spent in my opinion. I highly recommend getting one of these.

I\'ll be sticking with the Oral-B Precision Clean line for life.UPDATE 8/18/11: After almost 6 months of use, this little guy is still going strong! I\'ve had to replace both the batteries and head only once the whole time. Very happy with this toothbrush!"

If you don\'t position the brush precisely, the edges of the head batter your teeth-- sounding like a jackhammer in your mouth.I will replace the head with the \'sensitive\' style, which appear to be circular, and hope this fixes the problem.Added later: The sensitive brush head is circular and removes the jackhammer effect. Much better.Note that the sensitive brushes are often sold by subscription, another marketing strategy I do not like. I prefer to buy the brush heads when I need them, rather than on the sellers\' calendar schedule."

I have used the battery-only version which runs at half of the speed of the electric rechargeable; it seems to me that the extra speed does a better job of cleaning.  The battery lasts for a week or so before recharging is needed and seems to be replaceable though I have no idea of the cost.  Another dentist recommended the Phillips Sonicare but it is so much more expensive that I chose to stay with the Oral B which uses the same rotary bush system that a dentist uses to clean teeth!

I have been on automatic refills for 1 1/2 years and just noticed that the price they are charging for the next refill is much higher even with the 15% discount than for what I can order it for (from  the same seller offering the 15% discount).

I\'ve used several. You will need about 5 of these for just one cleaning.I\'ve revised my rating for this item. The floss does break too easy, but the floss is thinner than another product I have tried so it fits easier. Besides that I have found the end of this toothpick is much slimmer than any other I have tried and I can usually solve my problems with just the pointy end.So If you want these to help get food out of your teeth, they\'re good. If you want to actually floss with them, then get something else. These are just fancy toothpicks."

I really like the Oral-B because it has a small rechargeable base therefore the power of the toothbrush is consistent (unlike replacement battery units).  These replacement brush heads were a great value.  I like the \'dual clean\' since it has the revolving round bristles (on top) and the bristles that move up and down (on the bottom).  These brush heads make my teeth feel so clean that I feel like I just left the dentist office.  I particularly like that the blue bristles fade through time reminding you that it\'s time to replace the brush head (they last around 2-3 months depending on how often you brush).  No regrets buying these on-line - very competitive pricing (in fact far cheaper than retail stores) and shipping was fast.

This toothbrush is far superior to regular brushing.  Your teeth feel so clean afterwards.  I recommend using this product fully and then trying the FlossAction head.  The flossaction just seems to massage my gums and clean a notch better!  Also, each head has bristles with indicators but sometimes it\'s hard to tell when to replace the heads.  Just replace them every 6-8 weeks.  Also, the unit cleans so much better with the battery full rather than low.

So I spent about 40 minutes at the grocery store agonizing over my choice, and finally picked the Vitality due to its reasonable cost and the included replacement head. So far I really like it for getting my teeth clean without my feeling like I have to scrub. I notice I don\'t put near as much pressure on my teeth and gums as I used to. I still may switch to the sensitive heads, though, as my gums feel a little worn after brushing. I like the timer too.The only things I wish could be improved are the packaging (I almost cut my hand off removing the brush!) and the lack of a charger light. Otherwise I think this is a good buy and am looking forward to good report at my next dentist appointment.**UPDATE:**I did switch to the sensitive head and I like that better. My teeth still feel clean, and the brush is much gentler. I would advise the sensitive brush if you tend to use too much pressure when brushing.Also wanted to note that the instruction sheet is very thorough and gives good information on how to use the brush and how to tell if you\'re brushing too hard."

It makes great drip coffee whether you like it light or strong, and the filter is the reason why. We won\'t ever go back to paper filters; the gold filter is the way to go. Our only complaint is that if you like REALLY strong coffee AND want a lot of it (i.e., more than 8 cups...according to the water gauge), you are out-of-luck  because  the coffee grounds flow over the top of filter. Grounds in coffee - not so good.Finally, the Brita water filter that is a part of this coffee-maker (sold separately of course) works well too."

I didn\'t weigh them, but the Pulsonic is definitely lighter than my Sonicare brush. I also appreciate the fact that the Pulsonic comes with an extra brush head for deep cleaning, along with the standard charger. The basic brush head\'s shape does more for me than the Sonicare\'s as well.The Bad: Unfortunately, I just never felt like the Pulsonic was vibrating/cleaning as hard as my Sonicare. Instead of holding it in place and letting the brush do the work, the Pulsonic requires a fair amount of manual manipulation, during which the brush head can disengage from the main unit.The Verdict: It\'s slicker and cheaper than the competition, but in this case I think you\'re better off spending your money on the deeper cleaning, more reliable Sonicare line."

They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft.

Now to the point...- Quality of the cleaning - My first impression is that the feeling it leaves after you use the brush is slick and clean.  Im usually the type to brush when I can and I do religiously.  I feel this product does the job well and faster than using a manual toothbrush.- Charge - The charge last pretty much exactly what it says.  Depending how often you use it (I use mine twice-morning and night) It lasts about 10-14 days.- Timer -The quadrant timer is something that is useful as well.  I like how it \'paces\' you through the brushing.  There are times when my mind wanders and with this it gives a little pause in the vibrations to prompt you to go to the next quadrant in your mouth.- Durability -Its been about 5 or 6 months since I\'ve purchased it and it doesnt seem to have any durability issues.  When spending any more money for a high dollar item this is a concern for me.- Sound - The sound is a little bit louder than the Sonicare, but it wasn\'t a big concern for me.Overall, it was a choice between this and the Sonicare line, and I went with this after lots of research.  I like how this comes with a nice travel case so for the trips it is easy to store.  Many of the Sonicare products that is in the same price range did not.  Also the replacement heads for the brush are cheaper with the Oral B (more options to pick also)and it might not be a big deal to everyone, but I\'m sure the cost all adds up after years of use.  With all that aside, I\'m very happy with the product, because of the quality of cleaning. It says 2 minutes for a total clean, but I go the 2 minutes plus an extra 45-60 seconds and I get a better clean than manually brushing for 5 minutes plus.  I never had a \'break in\' time to have my gums adjust, which some people might need, but it was fine and gentle enough for me.  Ill never go back to manual toothbrushes again."

Flat out the best toothbrush I\'ve ever owned and worth every penny.  My dentist and periodontist agreed that my teeth and gums now are the best that they have been in my life.  I had been on a regular gum check and deep cleaning for years, and it is now removed--and the only big change I made was this toothbrush.  It is excellent with the gum cleaning (I alternate between the Floss Action a the Precision Clean heads).  Unlike previous Oral B\'s I\'ve owned, I like that this one does not reset the timer when you turn it off for a few seconds (in order to clear the foam and toothpaste!).  The charger is much smaller than previous Oral B stands. I agree with the previous review about the \'Smart Guide.\'  I didn\'t order this one specifically for the smart guide, but it came with it for only a little more.  It works great as a bathroom clock, and it helps me balance the quadrants and notes when I\'m pressing too hard).Absolutely no comparison and while it may seem expensive, it is WELL worth it!"

I wanted to see if a less expensive electric toothbrush, if it was comparable to the more expensive electric toothrushes, like the one I have been using for years now, and have been very satisfied with.This electric toothbrush doesn\'t have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive electric toothbrush, such as the ability to choose from more than one setting, or a UV sanitizer.I have to say tho that this electric toothbrush made my teeth feel like they were really being scrubbed, so when I was finished using it, my teeth felt very clean.  This electric toothbrush came with 2 brush heads, which seem alittle bigger than the more tapered ones Iam used to using, and this motor seemed to be alittle louder. It actually would slow down, then rev back up.  The automatic timer on this electric toothbrush is supposed to run for 2 minutes, but mine seemed to run for much longer than that, so I went with it.My other electric toothbrush runs for 3 minutes at the setting I use, so I didn\'t mind this.  You always have the option of just turning it off when you want to.I wish this electric toothbrush came with some kind of cover for the toothbrush heads, and some kind of travel case, but for the excellent price of this electric toothrush I can\'t complain.  It does come with a rechargeable stand, which I just leave my electric toothbrush always plugged in, and on the rechargeable stand.  That way it is always ready to use when I need it.I also like that in reading the information that came with this electric toothbrush, that you have like 5 different options for brush heads, depending on the kind you like.  The brush heads seem to be alittle more reasonably priced too, as I always like to buy a minimum of 3 brush heads at a time.  With this electric toothbrush you can even buy them in a quantity of 6, if you want to.  I like to have enough for a year, which they recommend you change your brush head every 3 months, which I agree, so I do that.If you\'ve always wondered if you would like using an electric toothbrush, but didn\'t want to spend the big bucks, you should try this electric toothbrush.  It works very well, at a reasonable price.The major reason to use an electric toothbrush to begin with is to really clean your teeth and gums, which this one seems to do that as well as my more expensive electric toothbrush.Having healthy teeth and gums is so important to your overall health.  Everyone should be able to afford to have an electric toothbrush. I know some of the electric toothbrushes are cost prohibitive, at over $100, but this Oral B electric toothbrush is under $30, much more doable for alot of people.I will continue to use this electric toothbrush, along with the other electric toothbrush I already have.Iam very happy that I was able to try this product, and very satisfied with the results I got."

They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you\'ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn\'t work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife\'s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you\'re used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I\'m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn\'t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I\'ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I\'m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit."

I like the fact that it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to another area of you teeth.  The pressure sensor works but I don\'t know that I\'d ever push hard enough to actually turn it on in use.The minor thing that I don\'t need is the stand accessory which has the holders for additional brush heads.  This could probably be useful for a family that shares a toothbrush and simply swaps heads.  I knew what I was ordering though and that\'s why I\'m still giving it 5 stars.  Maybe make a model with a simpler base for those of us that don\'t need the extra storage?

Before I tried the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count), I thought I had clean teeth. Clearly, I was wrong. I have been using the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) for about a month now and the difference is unbelievable! It\'s like instead of taking a quick dip in a community swimming pool, my teeth are being treated to a luxury bath with bubbles and a massage, EVERY DAY! Sometimes even twice a day. If the effects of the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) stopped there, I would be merely satisfied, but as you may pick up from my tone and use of exclamation points, I am ecstatic! I used to go on dates with the confidence of a nerdy insecure loser; picture Woody Allen, but with bigger glasses. Now I have the confidence to take on anything! It\'s like I\'m Rambo but not a psychopath and with the cleanest teeth EVER. But wait, there\'s more. The other day I was driving down the street and I got pulled over by a cop for speeding. He got out of his car, came up to my window, and asked me for my license and registration. As I gave it to him, I looked up and flashed him one of those Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) clean smiles. It just so happened that he was a user too. He instantly realized, gave me a nod and a wink, and ripped up my ticket. Thanks, Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I am obsessed with using it, for the FULL two minutes because of the just-been-to-the-dentist feel. I opted for the 55000 for the \'gimmicky\' timer which I absolutely love. When I travel I leave the timer at home and I always forget how long I\'ve been brushing. Is that vibrate the 2nd...or 3rd one? I can never remember because I usually try to do something else as I\'m brushing my teeth. So, for me, I love the timer.I love the feel of the 5000 over the 4000 (I bought my mom the 4000 for Christmas and she bought my Dad the same one).I always use the Floss Action head, it\'s by far my favorite.I was hoping this toothbrush would be a little quieter than it is but it\'s not outrageously loud. We have a master en-suite and with the bathroom door closed all the way and the rest of the house silent you can hear the toothbrush in the bedroom but it\'s not loud enough to wake my husband or myself up.I do share the handle of this toothbrush with my husband. Like some other reviewers have mentioned our battery life is not so great anymore. We can \'justbarely\' make it a week without having to recharge. It takes about 8-9 hours to charge fully.My biggest complaint is that within the last few weeks the red light on the timer (pressure sensing light) is almost continually on when we are using the toothbrush. I do need to find the manual and see if there\'s a way for us to calibrate or reset something. The toothbrush is still operating fine but I\'m afraid this issue is a sign of an impending serious malfunction."

With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh. The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline. It\'s not a substitute for flossing, but an additional help. My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven\'t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power. If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better. I\'m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea).

I love that it times the brushing for you, 30 seconds per quadrant, so you do a thorough job.  Last week I went back to the dentist for my 6-month followup, now 9 months pregnant, and anticipating the worst - but it was the best check up I\'ve ever had.  The cleaning was a breeze - I had hardly any buildup and everything looked great.

I am not the most dedicated of flossers but this electric toothbrush with it\'s Floss Action head does the trick.  The bristles are firm and get between the teeth to remove that heavy plague and gumlines.  I am not advocating this as s DEEP cleanser for that you probably need one of those electric at home Waterpik\'s, but this is the next best and cheapest alternative.While I am not big on rechargeable electric toothbrushes because I believe they are a bit passe, I won\'t discount this brush for being that, and matter of fact the rechargeable unit is not big and clunky as they use to be 10 years ago.

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It\'s kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

Recently it was time to order a new supply and I noticed that they had changed the name of the product to \'Extra Gentle\'. Seeing that they were still saying this was for canker sore sufferers I bought several tubes. Almost immediately after I started using this product I had one canker sore after another. I then changed to another SLS free brand and everything has healed up and is back to normal. My thoughts are that either this new product is worthless for preventing canker sores or I got a bad batch that had SLS in it. Attempts to contact the company through the \'contact us\' section of their web site have failed. I guess I\'ll be throwing away several tubes of this not inexpensive toothpaste.1/22 Edit - A few days after posting this review Rembrandt responded to my complaint to them about this product.

I\'m able to charge it up and take it on a long weekend and it works just fine.  It comes with a smaller brush for getting along your gums.

They are something that I happen to know very well. The product that I received came in a packaging that while different from what I am used to, still had the OralB logo, that I was familiar with. I figured that maybe there was just a difference in packaging for online markets. Well I guess that I should have questioned things more because I am convinced that I could not have received authentic OralB Floss Action brush heads. The brush heads I got all broke very soon after beginning to use them. I usually get about three months from each brush head as is indicated on the packaging for the heads. With these here, the brush heads all started coming loose easily move back and forth after only a few weeks. This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing. That was not enjoyable! I would say that these brush heads were either some kind of knock-off, or maybe someone found a way to sell the brush heads that were rejected in production. I guess that the lower than usual price for them should have been the first thing to question. I won\'\'t make the same mistake again."

Overall, we are both very satisfied with this product.Product Details and background for my review--------------------------------------------I have owned Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  I have owned a previous generation of Oral-B electric brush some years ago and found the build quality was poor when compared to Sonicare. Sonicare employs a rapid vibration of the brush head to generate sonic waves which dislodge plaque from teeth.  The Oral-B brush has a small, round head that rotates back and forth (It does not do full rotations.  If I had to guess about how much it rotates before it switches directions, I would guess somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees).  The package says that in clinical studies it improves gum health better than Sonicare advance.  I cannot provide feedback on this as I have not been to the dentist since I have been using the Oral-B and even if I had been, the results of that visit would not be guaranteed to be related to the brush itself.THE GOOD--------This toothbrush is very well constructed.  This new model has excellent build quality throughout.My teeth feel smoother after using the Oral-B than after using my Sonicare.  I thought I was imagining it and didn\'t mention it to my wife but when she approached me telling me her teeth feel cleaner and smoother, I was convinced that the mechanical performance of the brush was better at cleaning the teeth.  So far the battery performance is very good but it is a new brush so I expect it to be so.  It has a pacing mode similar to Sonicare\'s in that it gives the user feedback every 30 seconds (the brush head stops moving momentarily.  Sonicare beeps in this case, but I don\'t think this is a plus or minus for either brush).  I did like that the Oral-B will let you go beyond the 2 minutes (30 seconds for each quadrant of the mouth).  The Sonicare makes you start it again as it shuts off after 2 minutes.  I brush my teeth for 2 minutes and then brush my tongue so I find the fact that the Oral-B continues to run after 2 minutes is a plus.  The brush heads are cheaper than Sonicare and they have different kinds (basic cleaning, floss action -- which has little rubber floss picks in the head).  This brush gives you feedback when you press too hard.  My Sonicare Elite does not do this.  Cleanup is \'slightly\' more difficult with the Oral-B but the way the head connects is better making overall cleanup much better.  The Sonicare has a deep plastic well that houses the magnets that cause the pulsing.  Liquids (water, saliva, toothpaste) can get in there and it is not easy to get it out fully, even with a Q-tip.  Over time, this can cause mildew, so I have had to use a q-tip in alcohol to solve this.  The way the Oral-B is designed, this would never happen, you just remove the head, rinse it and give the brush a quick wipe on a towel.  The design is very good and supports easy cleanup.  I hesitate to put the wireless remote brush monitor in the \'Good\' category, as I don\'t like it, but some people who are really gadget-heads might enjoy this.  Basically it is a small LCD display that shows you where you are in the brushing cycle and gives you a visual cue when you\'re brushing too hard.  The brush itself gives you this feedback though, so I think this wireless thing is kind of \'hokey\' and when the batteries die, I\'ll likely toss it in the box and throw it under the stairs.  The good thing about it is that both my wife\'s brush and mine connect to a single wireless display without \'pairing\'.  I haven\'t tried to use it at the exact same time as her, but this obviously would not work.  It has tiny integrated legs so that you can lay it down on its side without it rolling away.THE BAD-------There is a \'mode\' button that lets you cycle through the five brushing modes.  It is right where I naturally want to put my thumb so I have had to train myself to put my thumb elsewhere so I don\'t keep changing modes while I brush.  It is much louder than my Sonicare  The Sonicare works by a magnet turning on and off rapidly so there is no connection between the brush head and the \'motor\'... In the Oral-B, there is basically a tiny axle that connects the motor to the brush head.  This is inherently noisier than the Sonicare design.  I don\'t find it terrible though.  I do not find the wireless lcd display to be useful.  Everything it provides can (and is) provided by feedback in the toothbrush itself.  The wireless lcd display is just another thing to clutter your bathroom vanity.  With that said, the pricing does not make it feel as if I paid extra for the lcd display so I am not too concerned about it.THE UGLY--------Nothing about this toothbrush was terribleOther things to considerThe brush has various modes (high speed, lower speed, one that slowly goes from gentle to vigorous and back, one that pulses, etc.  I believe there are 5 such modes).  I do not use them because my gums and teeth are not sensitive so I use the vigorous mode full-time but maybe somebody with sensitive gums would want the pulsing mode so they could have some gum stimulation without over-doing it."

Unfortunately, even on the sensitive setting, it hurt on impact, and I\'m not talking a little, I mean alot.  Thinking I was jumping the gun, I lightened up on it and went around the entire mouth.

It\'s got a very rough-and-tumble feel to it, but it feels so good, almost like a rough massage to my teeth and gums.I thought the brush head would be too small (I have big teeth - I\'m a big dude), but I liked the idea of the circular action, and I wanted to spend less than 50 bucks on an upgrade, so I gave it a shot.  It doesn\'t feel small, though, when it\'s running.  My teeth are sensitive and it\'s not an exaggeration to say that every teeth-brushing experience in my life has been tinged with a discomfort that is totally absent with this toothbrush, even though it has such an aggressive feel.  I\'ve used it for a week now and tonight it felt so good brushing that I had to come do a review.  Great product."

I could put up a video of my 10-year-old daughter squealing with delight as she used it for the first time, toothpaste and drool spraying everywhere.  I haven\'t seen her laugh that hard in a long time. In fact, the next day I realized some of the white spots on my t-shirt were NOT part of the design, but actually were toothpaste spray from my efforts to capture her on video. As electric toothbrush novices, we over-estimated how much toothpaste was needed.This toothbrush works perfectly fine.  It\'s a great way to get reluctant young tooth-brushers to do at least 2 minutes of brushing because it has a built-in timer, too.  It uses an inductive charging system so it won\'t rust and the battery holds a charge well.The only downside is that in our bathroom, it seemed as loud as a buzz-saw, but that didn\'t stop my kid from using it so I can\'t complain."

It truly felt like I just had my regular cleaning at the dentist.Besides the fact that the brush actually delivers on the results, the design is very well thought out.  The handle is slim and light and as easy to hold as a regular toothbrush.  The head vibration is well isolated from the handle and does not cause any discomfort.  The whole brush is completely water proof and can be washed easily.  There are no visible contacts for charging.  It just sits in the base and charges (I assume by induction) perfectly fine.It has a couple of settings for brushing or massaging and although I prefer the brushing setting for regular brushing, the massaging setting felt nice on my gums.  It has a reminder in the form of a brief pause every thirty seconds to facilitate proper brush timing.The brush comes with an additional smaller head that is meant to clean between the teeth.  It also does an excellent job at breaking up any particles and cleaning the space between the teeth and along the gum line.This is a very well built and thought out brush and I highly recommend it."

This toothbrush does an excellent job of brushing and massaging the gums. Furthermore, I believe there are different specialty brush head replacements that can be purchased. It DOES have a two minute time. In my opinion this is just as good if not better than having a 15 second timer. If you just brush your whole mouth for the full two minutes you\'ll get just as thorough and perhaps more so than if you do 15 seconds peer quadrant because you\'ll have almost as much paste on the brush for the other quadrants of your mouth. With the 15 second per quadrant type of brushing, by the time you get to the final quadrant you\'ve pretty much used all the fresh tooth paste.This is a bare bones electric toothbrush. It doesn\'t come with a travel case but I love it and see no reason to spend an extra $100 for a fancier Oral B or the other leading competitor."

The card comes with hefty monthly fees from Citibank to boot and a multi-page contract with detailed legal obligations attached to the use of the card.The rebate form makes absolutely no mention that the rebate will be in the form of a fee-based pre-paid debit card from P&G and Citibank, so when I received the card I was concerned that some identity theft had occurred.  None of the phone numbers on the card, the correspondence or on the Citibank pre-paid debit card actually work or if they do, do not allow you to reach a live customer service representative or leave a message.  (The number on the Citibank pre-paid debit card website that is given for customer support simply has a message that says your direct deposit will be processed on a certain date.)

Unfortunately the competitive price of this product did not make up for the poor quality and unsafety of it. During brushing, small pieces of metal came out of the toothbrush heads and shot into the gums and lips, sometimes causing lacerations. After this, the round brushing part of the head would come loose itself.After 3 of the toothbrush heads did this, I contacted the seller by email and then by phone and explained the problem to them. They apologized and explained that this was a generic product from a chinese manufacturer and although they had never run into this/any problem with their products before, they would send me a replacement (oral B original) product. I agreed.Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, as I began to use these \'original oral B\' toothbrush heads, the same problem has recurred with pieces of metal shooting out of the rotating toothbrush head during brushing and hitting the gums and lips. I\'ve been using oral B electric toothbrushes for a few years and have never seen anything like this. I\'m not exactly sure if this second set I have received are really oral B products or not.My point is that low price apparently means poor quality, at least in the case of this seller."

While it cleaned well, the brush head was so large that I had trouble keeping it in my mouth and keeping my mouth closed, especially when trying to reach my back teeth.  In addition, the neck is shorter than other brush heads and is wider.  Overall, made brushing my teeth much more difficult.

Batteries last 3-5 years (meaning 3 years), AND once the battery is exhausted and no longer holds a charge, you have to throw away the entire unit.The company\'s explanation is that the unit is water tight so removing the battery breaks that seal. This is horrific design flaw - if they wanted they could allow for battery replacement.BUT...allowing battery replacement means you wouldn\'t have to BUY AN ENTIRE NEW UNIT.So...essentially the consumer is being held hostage to a company that\'s designed a product that has to be thrown away.LASTLY...there is no easy means of recycling. I was told I had to go to a Braun service center. On Long Island. 30+ miles away. That\'s irresponsible. A company should stand behind their product; offer, at the very least, a reasonable outlet to recycle something.

I bought this toothbrush because of the good reviews and there was a promotion for a 1/2 off rebate.  So, I only paid $51 for it after receiving the rebate.That being said, I really like this toothbrush and am very happy that I bought it.  It makes my mouth feel so much cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.I bought my 3 yr old son and 5 yr old daughter a Philips Sonicare for kids and tried that toothbrush.  I did not like the Sonicare toothbrush at all.  The sonicare toothbrush vibrates and it made my mouth feel numb even after I was done using it.  My son wouldn\'t even try the sonicare, and my daughter tried it, but didn\'t like it.  However, my daughter uses the Oral-B every night (She still uses her manual one once a day).  She says she likes the Oral-B.  I bought her some kids replacement heads (I found them on ebay for a really good price).  She likes the smiley face that shows up on the timer after you reach the two minutes.  She even used it longer to see if it would wink at her, which it does.  She watches the timer while I\'m brushing her teeth and I have never had a problem reaching the 2 minute brushing time.The toothbrush comes with a stand and a place to put four toothbrush heads which is nice.  I have two heads in there for me and one for my daughter.  Once I can convince my son to use the toothbrush, there will be space for his toothbrush head.

The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage. Obviously Oral-B is trying to cut corners here by offering a newer model with inferior quality.If you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine.

While I have been blessed with a cavity free mouth, I still hate enduring the scrape of the dentist\'s tools against my teeth. And I know it\'s just a matter of time until the dentist breaks out his drill...It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  You can probably chalk it up to \'user error\'....  I wasn\'t brushing properly, nor long enough to really keep a clean mouth.I did a bunch of research on electric toothbrushes to see what the fuss was about. Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  hmmm...  more research led me to this model - the motorized head rotates in the recommended pattern and the handle buzzes/vibrates in 30 or 45 second intervals to help you judge the brushing time of each section of your mouth.  Recommended time is 30 seconds per quadrant.  But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn\'t enough for me.  What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up) the amount of time you have been brushing.  If you look at the picture of the box, you can see the digital display, it\'s a little bit bigger than a business card, and about an inch thick.  As you are brushing, the display will track the quadrant you are brushing, and when your brush handle buzzes, the digital display will move to the next quadrant - giving you a visual que to move on to the next section of your mouth. It will even tell you if you\'re brushing too hard! When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds... the smiley face will wink at you!  :  It\'s a flirty toothbrush!My husband and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  We absolutely love them.  We recieved them two days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.  I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn\'t a big deal. I never have to wonder if I\'m brushing properly or if I\'m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \'fresh from the dentist\' clean mouth.  The handle holds its\' charge for a long time, I can brush for 2 1/2 minutes twice a day, for 9 days before having to recharge - however, I usually keep the brush handle in the charger when it\'s not in use.I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  The travel case is a hard, sturdy plastic to protect the brush handle, and the detachable brush.  It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly. My toothbrush will never again travel in a ziploc baggie.  :) Yay!I did have a little bit of sticker shock when I purchased two of these at the same time, and then again when I saw the cost of replacement brush heads.  But I feel like I am taking good care of my teeth, and I know my next dentist appointment will be less stressful.  Also - I know P&G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time. This makes me feel like I\'ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  Plus P&G offers coupons on their website all the time, so I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.This model isn\'t just an electric toothbrush - It\'s quality control for your mouth!  I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  Happy Brushing."

Amazon claims that \'The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\'  But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush. The toothbrush does work, however. I have two identical Oral-B 3D excel toothbrushes purchased on 8/20/01.  To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  I run the battery down to zero on the one I\'m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it\'s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle itself.Some reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that\'s hard to imagine:  there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  It\'s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it. It\'s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better."

2205,2255,20110116,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 16, 2011",A3MPOPREPBPUR9,"Amazing cleaning, wonderful quality, and great price... Very happy!","First of all, a comment on the price...This is an amazing price for the Oral-B 5000. I just saw them yesterday (Jan. 15, 2011) at my local Target store for 159.00 with no rebate offers. So, getting one here through Amazon for under a hundred is a great buy! Not only was 96.00 a great price, but mine also came with a 50% mail-in rebate offer, which was a nice surprise. So, after that I will have only paid 48 bucks! Awesome! My girlfriend also got the rebate with hers. I don\'t know how long the rebates will last, but even without the rebate, this is an excellent price, and well worth every penny!After reading all the reviews here, and talking to my dentist about it and hearing his recommendation, my girlfriend took the plunge and ordered one a couple weeks ago. As soon as she tried it, she fell in love with it. She told me how good it felt on her teeth, and how clean her mouth felt after using it, and how she really looked forward to brushing. I immediately ordered mine the same day.My first impressions on the build quality...After opening and unpacking mine, I was immediately impressed with the build quality of the unit. The brush handle is solid and seems very well constructed, and the head that holds the brushes seems strong. I fully expect this to last a long time, and hold up really well. It\'s also attractive to look at, and the batteries last a long time on a full charge.This model comes with a separate wireless display unit, that displays brushing information while you\'re using it, and functions as a clock when you\'re not brushing. It displays a timer that will countdown from 2:00 minutes, or count up depending on your preference. It also shows the quadrants of your teeth for a visual reminder to make sure you get all areas. It displays which brushing mode you\'re using, and will flash a warning if you press too hard.Is the display really necessary? Perhaps not... The brush unit will vibrate each 30 or 45 seconds to remind you to change to the next quadrant. And it will stutter when the time is up to let you know you\'ve completed the recommended time. But, it is nice to have those visual cues where you can see them easily, and it is nice to have a small bathroom clock handy. So, I really like the display unit a lot. I think it was a nice addition, and I think most people will appreciate it.My impressions on actually using the brush...I\'ve had mine only a week so far, but I love it completely! I honestly think this is one of the best investments in my health I\'ve ever made. I\'ve never taken care of my teeth like I should have, and I have several fillings to show for it. I\'ve always tried to brush at least twice a day, but they were always short, quick brushes, by hand, and not very thorough. And I never thought I would be excited about brushing, until now.Now, I love brushing. I look forward to it. I brush at least three times a day, and never less than two minutes each time. I love how long the battery lasts, so I can take it with me to work, or on trips. This brush really makes it easy to stay on top of brushing. I can feel how thoroughly each tooth is getting cleaned, and it feels good on my teeth and gums. I haven\'t experienced any discomfort using mine.After brushing, my teeth are literally squeeky clean. It really does feel like a professional cleaning. It\'s only been a week with mine, but I can already notice a difference in their appearance. I\'m excited to see how they will look after a couple months.One last thing I really like is the carrying case that comes with it. It holds the brush firmly in place, and two brush heads firmly in place. Very convenient for carrying with me.This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I can\'t even imagine going back to a manual brush. I highly recommend this, and I\'m sure you will enjoy it just as much.Hope that helps..."

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17 (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)What worries me about this listing is that it claims to be the Extrasoft EB17, but the picture of the item shows the Flexisoft EB17.  Be warned, Amazon might be confused about this item and selling it incorrectly labeled.  On the Extrasoft EB17, all the bristles around the outside edge are the same color.

So when I first turned it on, I was afraid as it sounds like a dentist\'s drill!  However, I soon adjusted and am now quite the fan.  It comes with a two minute timer which sort of stutters when the time is up.  And with this gadget those two minutes I have found simply fly by.  What I most like, though, is that this toothbrush really does seem to get in deep between all the nooks and crannies and cleanse my teeth very well.  I also like that I\'m able to reach back and even brush my wisdom teeth and get them clean.  Something I couldn\'t do with a manual toothbrush.  Since this is my first electric toothbrush I had to learn to adjust also to the fact that I don\'t have to press down hard and push like with a manual toothbrush.  This one really does the work for you.  And I have found it best to let it linger some on each tooth.  And the results are that my teeth really do look and feel clean.  I\'m quite pleased with this gadget and I do very much recommend it.  It comes with a replacement toothbrush head as well, however, you have to figure out a way to store it on your own.  As it doesn\'t come enclosed in any type of case or anything like that.  I currently have mine wrapped in a paper towel.  Overall, though, I am most pleased and happy with this toothbrush.P.S.  After using this product for more weeks I\'ve discovered fine lines creeping in on the edges of my lips.  I noticed that with this toothbrush the toothpaste seems to gather there and I think the toothpaste was burning my skin.  I have very sensitive skin.

There is a real deal breaker here.The Good: When compared to my Sonicare, this brand actually works better at removing plaque, and I really, really like the little pick brush. It gets into tight areas and along the gum line if you need it to.The Bad: There are problems with this product though. Even on the \'sensitive\' setting, the brushing can be a bit harsh. If it didn\'t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it\'s not. I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation. This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing. Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes. Yes, this one is supposed to beep, but my didn\'t always do that.The Ugly: Then there\'s the deal breaker - the handle is so small and it vibrates so intensely in my hand that it is painful to use on a daily basis. I have carpal tunnel on the right and an old stress fracture on the left, so even though this products does what it is supposed to do very well, I will continue to use my larger grip, smoother running Sonicare on  a regular basis and this product only once in  awhile for a \'spit polish.\' I would not recommend this product for anyone with large hands, previous or current hand injury or nerve damage, or any one with arthritis."

I\'d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it\'s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you\'re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.I have one implant, and some \'erosions\' on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it\'s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.Don\'t throw away that manual toothbrush, though.  There is still one mouth maintenance chore that the Oral-b does not handle well -- brushing of your tongue.  The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \'tooth\' brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  If you check my other reviews, you\'ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed."

It also warns you if you are pressing too hard.3. It comes with a very handy travel case, so you could travel with it and two different heads.4. The charger base and extra head organizer if a nice touch.Cons:1. I wish it would remember the last mode you use and start in that mode.  I use the gentle mode most often, and I wish I didn\'t have to hit the mode button each time I start it to get to that mode.  That being said, it\'s very simple to do and a habit not.  That is my only thing against it, and it is minor.I very much like this toothbrush.  I wish I could get more rebates. I would be giving these out as gifts!"

Any retail store you go to this is going to be around $140-$160.I will start with the pros. The first time I started using the Oral B 5000 toothbrush I noticed how clean my teeth felt after brushing. I have been using this product for over a month now and love the pressure sensor. That is the main reason why I bought this product is because I have a habit of brushing hard. It has 4 dedicated modes which are great and one mode with extended time. I switch modes pretty much every time I use it. My teeth are getting slightly whiter after a month. The wireless brushing guide/clock is really handy so you can see what mode you are on and how much time you have been brushing. The charging base is great and very portable compared to other models.Now the cons. There are only a few things that I can think of that aren\'t that great with this toothbrush. The display mode on the handle really bugs me. It just displays the battery and nothing else. This is pretty pointless especially when you travel. Because it doesn\'t tell you which mode you are in so you have to go by feel to figure which mode you want. The display of the battery is so large it makes me wonder how much battery it drains to display that thing because its always on. That brings me to my next point is the life of the battery. It says in the manual that the life is 10 days. But seems to be less than that. My girlfriend has the 4000 and hers lasts longer than mine. Her display is for the battery is smaller and in the corner of the display instead of enourmous and in the middle. Other than big default this product is great especially for the price Amazon has it at!"

It holds a charge for over a week which is great for travel.  It is very slim which is great for packing but a little hard to hold.  Repalcement heads are way way to expensive but that is true of most electric brushes."
1561,1599,20090114,B001CX4JSS,2,"January 14, 2009",A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,Good Product Except for the Fatal Flaw,"I was encouraged when I received this toothbrush.  Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife\'s mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a \'clean\' mode and a \'sensitive\' mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars."

I went 4 years without any real dental care, my mouth soon became the \'hoarders\' of teeth (so to speak). Recently I\'ve came across the money, the dentist, and the courage to fix them  and so far the progress has been amazing. One serious problem with my mouth were my gums, they were majorly inflamed and very, very weak. Along with that there were tight gaps between my teeth, so I could not floss. A friend gave me this and I\'m actually shocked. Not ONLY could I easily floss my teeth, but within two weeks the inflammation(Known more commonly as gingivitis)was died down to a very manageable point, and within three it was practically completely gone.Crest and their entire line of \'Pro-Health\' items have been absolutely AMAZING for my teeth.

It\'s not that I didn\'t brush after every meal when I was doing it manually; it\'s that these toothbrushes do a significantly better job. Furthermore, although their use has never actually whitened my teeth, it slows down the degree of stain accumulation from tea, coffee, etc., so that I do not have to bleach my teeth as often.Having said all that: This model does not work any better than my trusty Oral-B S-200. It also has the same drawback, that the rechargeable batteries do not last forever and when they give out, you must buy a whole new unit. When in use, the toothbrush sounds louder than the S-200 and different, resembling a dentist\'s drill.  For anyone thinking of using older heads they have around, my S-200 heads do not fit on this model--the shaft is different.

324,332,20040209,B00006ANDQ,5,"February 9, 2004",AS627L9YJHE1P,"An easy, safe, effective way to brush","Dentists all over the country are recommending the Oral-B electric toothbrush.  There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for four Flexisoft EB17 heads for $24.99 (The EB17-4 just means there are four of them).  There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $12.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!"

I am very tired of spending 50$ or so a year on new brush heads between my wife and I.  I had her try this brush out for 2 weeks to see if she could tell the difference between the two, and she could.  She said it did not feel nearly as powerful, nor did it clean nearly as well. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the form, and feel of the toothbrush.  If you simply cannot, or do not want to spend the money on the sonicare then I might buy this toothbrush.  I contacted oral b to ask if they offer a money back guarantee, which sonicare does. Oral b said they did not offer the guarantee on this model, but only on a couple of other models.  FIGURES!  The lady was polite, but I told her I was upset that I wasted my money on their product, and I will not be buying from them in the future.  We just bought a new sonicare base and it was within 4$ of what I spent for this brush, so you can no longer argue that they are in different categories.  I would not recommend this toothbrush to anyone."

They are brand name Oral B replacements. If you\'re thinking about being cheap and buying a knock off replacement please don\'t! Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the real thing. Your Oral B toothbrush was meant to be used with Oral B heads. The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand. As far as the advertised \'Pro White\', I cannot attest to that. I seem to highly doubt that just by using a different head that you\'re teeth are magically gonna become whiter.

My son bought this as a gift for me, and I can honestly say that my teeth and mouth have never felt so fresh and clean. I actually look forward to brushing with my Oral B 5000. It feels as good if not better than after you\'ve gone to have your teeth cleaned at the dentist.

We own two, rechargeable, Oral B toothbrush bases and each child and I has our own brushhead that simply snaps on and off.In comparison to brushing with a manual toothbrush, the Oral B electric toothbrush is a far superior brushing solution. You can\'t really compare manual brushing to an Oral B anymore than you can compare a bike to a car.  A bike will get you there, but not as quickly or comfortably as a car. The oral B accesses harder to reach areas of your mouth easier than a manual toothbrush, and the brush spins much faster than you could ever hope to brush on your own.In comparison to other electric toothbrushes, I chose the Oral B because it was far more economical than other brands. It is affordable, and the brush replacement costs are very reasonable, especially when you buy bulk packages here or at a warehouse store.Now, on to this specific Oral B brushhead.  The base unit also works with the standard Oral B brushheads that I already use.  This brush head is slightly more oval shaped to mimic a tooth\'s surface and shape, versus the circular standard brushhead.  It also has a polishing cup in the center of the brush head where brush bristles would normally be present on the standard, circular brush head. So, picture the standard brush head with a polishing cup in the dead center of the brush head and you can get a mental picture of this new brush head\'s design.With the more powerful motor and new brush head, I like this Oral B better than the standard Oral B that I have been using.  It cleans even better and I really like the polishing cup since I am a heavy coffee drinker and try to minimize teeth staining.  While you can\'t go wrong with any of the Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes, I would recommend this one.  If you are still using a manual toothbrush, I would strongly suggest at least trying out an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  If you do, you will never go back to manual brushing again.UPDATE.......After using this brush head for several months now, I am convinced that it has made my teeth more white. I had worked it into my normal brushing routine and had forgotten about it.  I started to notice my teeth seemed whiter, and I couldn\'t figure out why.  I started thinking about it and realized the only change was the brush head and more powerful motor.  (my toothpaste was the same)."

It is too early to evaluate the long-term benefits promised by this product, but I find it a very simple and practical design, easy to store, clean and use. It is slim in the hand and very lightweight, most of my earlier experiments were thick and bulky, and cumbersome to navigate around the mouth. Like brushing your teeth with a flashlight.The Oral-B has a good feel to it, natural and well-balanced, and that makes me more likely to pick it up instead of a \'manual\' brush. The brush itself is rather petite, but this makes getting into tight areas a little easier. The noise was startling at first, a shrill buzz that reminded me of another reason I never took to electrics: it shatters the quiet ritual of morning and evening brushing.But if it works, it will be worth it. I  have so far found the single biggest complaint is that my usual rather aggressive style of use needs to be restrained, or the brush head will twist off of the body. It\'s a � turn quick release, and this is great for cleaning and sanitizing, but it seems to pop off in the mouth rather easily. How the bristles survive until I learn a gentler touch remains to be seen. I have to remember it\'s like running a polishing tool, not a backhoe.The unit is totally sealed and waterproof, as is the charger-base. Makes clean-up a cinch, and with induction charging connection, no pesky exposed electrical connections. Pretty much standard these days, I would expect. Another small but obvious feature that you\'d only notice if it was not there: the motor shuts off upon return to the base, like hanging up a phone.It has two speeds, \'normal\' and \'sensitive\'. I find normal is probably better to use, it tickles quite a but but it is not too hard to get used to. I use the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant. I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits. A double-blip signals the end of the session, as does a mouthful of hyper-foamed toothpaste. Try not to drool, OK?"

More massage action and it gets between teeth better than the standard Oral B brush.Warning: There are a lot of counterfeit brushes being sold on the internet.

I thought I\'d try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush since the price fits our budget better. Unfortunately, I think the Sonicare experience set the bar too high and the Oral-b toothbrush did not meet my expectations.Oral-b features I liked:-Lightweight (lighter than the Sonicare)-Compact head-Bristles rotate and get in between teeth fairly well, but seem a little harsh along the gum line-InexpensiveHere\'s how the Sonicare one is better than the Oral-b one:-The Sonicare has a slimmer brush head \'neck\' between the bristles and the base/handle; the Oral-b one feels awkward because it\'s thicker-Sonicare has adjustable timing in 30 second increments up to 3 minutes, with auto shut-off; Oral-b has an alert that goes off at 2 minutes, but it doesn\'t turn off and it\'s not adjustable-The Sonicare brush/bristles have a plastic cover for when toothbrush is not in use; Oral-b just stays exposed when not in use, much like a regular toothbrush-The Oral-b toothbrush is louder than the Sonicare toothbrushOverall, I felt like my teeth were very clean, except along the gum line where I was hesitant to direct the Oral-b brush since it\'s a little harsher than my Sonicare (and I have sensitive gums already). I think it does a better job cleaning teeth than a standard toothbrush. It takes a little getting used to, but it\'s a step towards healthier oral care if you don\'t already use an electric toothbrush."

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it\'s kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

Most of them work pretty well. This one however, works wonders! If you\'re thinking that the timer/sensor is gimmicky... you\'re wrong. It comes with an adhesive backer so you can stick it to your mirror (or wherever you brush your chompers). I used be the person who brushed for maybe 30 seconds. But with the timer, you can\'t help but feel like crap for quitting early. It tells you how long you\'ve been brushing, the battery level, if you\'re brushing too hard, which zone you should be brushing, and what mode you\'re in. AWESOME! The battery lasts for about a week, but if you\'re on a longer trip you can take the charge out of the base (it\'s tiny) and pack it with you. There are tons of different brush heads and different brush modes, depending on what you\'re trying to accomplish. I got this toothbrush last September and have had two dentist cleanings since then.

I GENERALLY am a review & research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I\'ve read reviews on but I went in for a dental appointment years ago and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding & inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers so I was sold! I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn\'t compare any former experience and simply didn\'t know any better.  I DO have to say that other than my \'unsanitary\' concern about these that I\'ll get to in a moment, it\'s great! I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard, it\'s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine, I have never had any \'break\' or get wobbly on me, there is a color indicator where the blue area on your toothbrush gets lighter over time to let you know when it\'s time to swap out your toothbrush, etc.Let me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it\'s clean & smells good, my home is clean - in fact I\'m actually somewhat of a germaphobe so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  I know it\'s odd to point all that out but I didn\'t want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  :-).No matter WHAT I do...I\'ve tried using bottled water to brush my teeth thinking it\'s our tap water (it\'s not...my kids & hubby don\'t have an issue w/ their toothbrushes); I\'ve tried switching to a different toothsoap / tooth powder / toothpaste - and I STILL have the same issue.  My hubby & dentist have confirmed that I don\'t have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth so it\'s not in my mouth...so I\'m left to think that is DEFINITELY the DESIGN of Oral-B toothbrush replacements heads!!!Humor me for a minute and do a \'zoom\' on the picture of Oral-B replacement toothbrushes in the middle of the toothbrush handle.  There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle while brushing then certainly a mixture of that & water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets in.I DO make a habit of actually removing my brush head in running water and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks & on the bottom where you place the charger) AND on the toothbrush head itself - both on the brush area and on & inside the handle and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide & a clean washcloth (since I didn\'t know where the smell was coming from) AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  It does NOT happen when I take all of these precautions but in my opinion, I shouldn\'t HAVE to do this in order to avoid the musty smell...musty stench means that bacteria is harboring & growing so to stick something filled with germs to \'clean\' with is not the best option in my opinion.FYI: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it\'s not me and sure enough, it\'s not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn\'t have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I\'m currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it\'s a design flaw in the brush design.I\'d rather not have to worry if my toothbrush is growing bacteria or not, I want to simply rinse the brush & handle after each use and store it away like I\'m supposed to be able to do.  I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  I don\'t understand how anyone else hasn\'t complained about this issue - maybe I\'m taking care of them wrong but I\'ve even called the company and it was suggested that maybe it was our water or toothpaste...when I told her that my other family members didn\'t have this issue, she was at a loss.For those who are also looking & comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it\'s more dome shaped so the toothpaste \'gunk\' from brushing & rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the \'dome shape\' vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle & electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B\'s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it\'s hard to get in small areas of your mouth."

After a few uses, kapoot! Head gets wobbly, then loose, then gone.I agree with a prior reviewer that the likelyhood of someone going to all the trouble of setting up a production line to produce fake knock-offs, at this price point, would be very low. I believe, as others, that Braun simply started using an alternate source for production without paying attention to quality.Braun, if you\'re paying attention: Address this issue soon, as you will be losing a number of die-hard customers!Amazon, if you\'re paying attention: Consider contacting your sellers about these obviously inferior products.

The head consists of one upper and one lower brush which work independently of the other.  The fat, round one on the top oscillates while the slightly squared one on the bottom moves from side to side.  It comes with an additional brush head, and there are five different brush heads which can be purchased.  They are described in the instructions, and there is a $3 coupon included inside the box.After approximately two and one-half minutes, the brush slows down and gives a couple of sluggish spurts, which signals time to stop brushing. It doesn\'t stop by itself and has to be turned off. It is compact and fits well in smaller hands.  I wasn\'t expecting too much from this little toothbrush but was very surprised at its vigorous action.  My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after use.  I can\'t determine how long the battery will last, as I\'ve used it only for a couple of weeks.  I am sold on Oral-b, and certainly will consider this brand when its time for my next automatic toothbrush."

The design of the handle was well thought out and easy to charge and use.  The footprint that was necessary on the counter was amazingly small.  BUT, and it is a big \'but\' the head was too big for even an adult mouth.  I am a grown person and asked my daughter to try it.  She could barely get it in her mouth and could not maneuver it to reach her teeth with gagging.  They need to try and overcome the space needed to make the mechanicals of a swirling AND a scrubbing head able to occupy the space at the end of the brush that is supposed to fit in your mouth.  It is nice that they have designed different heads to address different issues related to plaque and gums, but if you can only reach the front region of your teeth with it, your dental health would seem to suffer.  If they could downsize the head a bit, it would be a wonderful product."

I have been using Oral-b products for years and knew they are a good product.  I do not need all the bells and whistles they offer and this one had everything I need.I have been using it for about a month now and really like it.  It holds a charge really well and it came fully charged.  The 2 minute dentist recommended time indicator is great.  I find I brush longer now and pay more attention to each area because I know I will be reminded when it is time to change areas.  I have used a smaller toothbrush for years and found this one to be a perfect size brush as well as the handle is not that much bigger than a manual toothbrush.  The only thing that I don\'t love is the cord is in the base - not detachable so the base needs a larger space to accomidate the cord.  Not a large space but more than it would if the cord was detachable.I would definately buy another or recommend it to others.

At first I thought it was crazy to spend about $120.00 on a toothbrush, but I\'m glad I did. I was probably like alot of you who used the regular toothbrushes that only cost about $3.00 or so.  About a month ago my dentist asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  Told him just a plain jane toothbrush which I switch out every 3 months or so.  He recommended that I purchase an electric one because he\'s a firm believer in them.  He told me what kind he had, which was the Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable made by Oral-B.  He said there are several different price ranges, styles, and brands.  One of the many features I like on mine is the wireless SmartGuide which has a personalizing timer on it.  This helps you brush all four quadrants of your mouth equally. 5 brushing modes- Daily Clean, Sensative, Massage, Whitening, and Deep Clean.  It also has an idicator that lights up when too much pressure is being applied, this is a great feature because I was brushing too hard with my regular toothbrush which caused my gums to bleed.  Since I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 I haven\'t had any problems with it, no bleeding gums, and my teeth feel as though I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  If there is a Con it would be that I had to purchase the precision clean head seperately because it only comes with the floss action and ProWhite heads.  However you also get a 5.00 off coupon to save money on your additional heads you might purchase.  Over all I\'m more than happy with the product and Amazon.com didn\'t waste anytime getting it sent to me.  I hope this helps any possible future buyers. Semper FI"

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  This particular item is three heads.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads.  You can find them for much less than $10/head, which is the price of this listing."

They should have used a nickel metal hydride or lithium ion/polymer rechargeable battery instead. Or, include an option to use regular AA batteries. Ni-Cad batteries are notoriously memory prone and don\'t really last long at all. In fact, the instructions for this unit state not to leave the charger/stand plugged in unless the unit is ready to be charged up. This is because if you charge it when it isn\'t fully drained, the battery will not last as long on subsequent charges due to the memory issue. Oral-b should be ashamed of themselves for incorporating such a lame battery in what could be a more useful product with a better internal battery.Luckily, I have an old Oral-b power toothbrush that takes regular AA batteries and the brushes from this unit fit on it! So, when the stupid ni-cad battery on this unit fails, I can use my old base and regular AA batteries but still use the dual head brush attachment.I can\'t recommend anyone buy this based on the fact that the battery is not viable. If you can find one that takes regular batteries I think that would be better for you (you can use rechargeable in that if you want)."

The only caveat is that the brush heads do need to be replaced once worn down; if used properly (2 minutes twice a day), they will make 3 months without issue, although some may wear them down slower/faster due to differing brush habits.All orders for this product through amazon.com have been flawless; product is exactly as described and in perfect condition.

My first brush broke up in just 4 or 5 uses. A pin in the back that supports the brush head fell off. The second one can\'t even fit my Oral-B Vitality well. The vibration kicks it off in 5 seconds! I have to use my fingers to keep it stay in position. If I spent half the price to get a fake one, I would expect it lasts at least half as long as the real product. This one lasted only a couple of days.

Let me just start off by mentioning why I rated this product 4 instead of 5 stars. All of the different setting on the brush seem fairly pointless so I think it it would be easy to downgrade to another Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series Toothbrush without the \'massaging\' \'whitening\' or \'deep clean\' settings. So this isn\'t really a negative aspect of the product but something that the consumer is paying for and doesn\'t seem to be getting any extra benefit. Save yourself the extra cash and just get one of the more basic models; I only use the daily clean setting.Since using the Oral-B I do believe that my teeth gave become more white and have a greater overall brush experience. I think this has much to do with the included \'Pro-White\' head that is included along with the \'Floss Action\' head. The rubber cup on the head really wipes away plaque and buildup. I can\'t really say that the \'Floss Action\' head is all that the name seems to claim but it does seem to be a great everyday head to use when accompanied with daily flossing.Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Oral-B Professional Care Series to anyone looking to take great care of their teeth.

While the Sonicare still has more bells and whistles overall (this could be due to model difference), I\'m willing to sacrifice those little things for what I think is probably one of the two criteria that actually matter: 1) how well the brush cleans and 2) how clean the brush stays.

The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  I can\'t comment on the alleged \'flossing action\' since I still floss and I\'m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven\'t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  The things we do for oral hygiene.So yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B\'s Vitality.  That\'s just your teeth and gums howling like Westley from The Princess Bride being tortured.  Well, your teeth and gums are wimps.  They\'ll get used to it and thank you later.  Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you\'ve just had a professional cleaning.  The secret, of course is the much-vaunted circular buffing motion.  You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  Problem solved.  Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there\'s not a lot to complain about.  If you\'ve got the bucks and a hankering for oral hygiene, then you could surely do worse than to invest in Vitality."

The reviews and the rebate attracted me to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. I especially liked the polishing mode, since I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth. I didn\'t think that I\'d use the clock/timer/sensor, but I decided to put it up to have a small clock in my bathroom. I\'m using it all of the time! I give my teeth a \'spa treatment\' - floss, polish, massage gums...and feel like I\'ve had a professional cleaning. Having always been a diligent brusher, I was surprised to see that I could benefit from the reminder to brush each of the four areas for 30 seconds. The little warning light that tells me when I\'m exerting pressure (and thus brushing too hard - all you have to do is hold the brush up to the surface of the tooth and let it do the cleaning) is useful for breaking a bad habit that seems to crop up in the same place quite often.I even like the smiley face as a reward for good brushing, although I usually tend to be rather jaded about such things. I think that I\'ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. And I\'m also glad for the travel case since I hated to make trips without my Bruan (you just can\'t got back to manual brushing after you\'re brushed this well), but I\'d find that the \'on\' button sometimes got pressed in my luggage and used up the charge. The base for the Oral-B is also small enough to pack easily."

But few complains about this specific model 5000.1) The handle on 5000 is much bigger than on other similar toothbrushes. It is less comfortable to hold in hand.2) The extra device coming with model 5000 is useless. It is supposedly an \'advanced\' timer which makes beeping noise when you need to switch sides of teeth to brush and when to stop brusing. I think, timers embedded in the toothbrush handle itself (what they do for less expensive models) do better job - there is absolutely no benefits to have timer separately (in addition it\'s screen is hard to see).3)The electric plug on this toothbrush is much longer than on other models. The base, though, is much smaller. Apparently they moved electronics from the base (where toothbrush stands) to the plug. It does not look good when plug is plugged in recepticle and it makes dificulties always to avoid pushing the plug.4) Another big complain - never received rebate. it was $50 rebate for this toothbrush when I bought it in August. I filled all forms and send them in. But, until today I do not have rebate. I opened case with amazon and will give you update if I get rebate eventually. I see these toothbrushes constantly going with rebates (there is $20 rebate now)."

I never successfully got the top off - someone else did it for me.  If our 4 year old granddaughter had been here, she  would have been able to take off the childproof cap for me.

The Oral-B Professionals have the circular brush head and work differently than the Pulsonic or Philips\'s Sonicare toothbrushes.  Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I\'m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.The Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  It\'s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  The brush head of the Pulsonic is a breeze to take on and off; you slide it onto the unit and then give it a quarter-twist.  The brush head locks into place.  I hate how the brush head gets stuck on my Professional model, so this is a big advantage of the Pulsonic.  The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there\'s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  When it\'s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional\'s circular head.  The Pulsonic assists in cleaning by sending out sonic pulses, similar to a jewelry sonication cleaner.  This is used to blast off debris and break up bacteria biofilms that are populating your teeth and gums.  The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  Here\'s where I feel is the key difference that should determine which type of toothbrush you should get.  I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  The Pulsonic requires you to make tiny circular motions over your teeth and assists your cleaning with the sonic vibrations.  The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don\'t get me wrong, it\'s much better than a manual toothbrush.  But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  I\'ve never had a cavity, but the dentist always complains that my gums are a little too puffy or too red.  After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  I don\'t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.The other thing I\'ll mention about the Pulsonic is the base.  The base has a small footprint size and the Pulsonic simply rests in a small hole in the base.  It\'s a bit wobbly, but it works alright.  The problem I have, however, is that there are only two spots for brush heads.  The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have their own brush head(s) it\'s an annoying inconvenience.So I think the choice is up to your specific needs.  If you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush and commonly have cavity problems, then maybe you want to go with one of the high-end Oral-B models that have a circular head.  If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I\'d recommend the Pulsonic.  I\'m not a dentist, so that\'s just my opinion.  For my needs, though, I\'ll be sticking with the Pulsonic.UPDATE:I went to the dentist recently for my standard 6-month check-up.  I\'ve never had cavity problems before, but the dentist had always warned me that my gums and gum pockets were borderline beginning to show problems.  Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  While the hygienist was cleaning my teeth she asked, \'do you use an electric toothbrush?\'  When I replied yes, she said, \'yeah, I can tell.\'  So, there ya go.  I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they\'ve been in in years.  With that, I\'ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush."

The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.In particular, note that the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per second, and does not have a battery charging indicator. All of which are present just one level up in the Professional Care 1000.To me the lack of a quadrant timer is a big disappointment - I don\'t want to be watching a clock while brushing if I don\'t  have to. The gentle thrumming of the Professional Care 1000 every 30 seconds is a very nice pacer.The brushes in the Professional Care series not only add quadrant timers, but also are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second, and have battery charge indicators.As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.Overall, I found the Vitality to be lacking features that I rely on. Hence my rating. I\'d strongly recommend that you consider the Professional Care 1000 as the minimum entry level functionality for a brush.

It started out normal but then it slowed down or stopped very easily while brushing.  At first, I thought it was low battery but this issue didn\'t improve after I replaced the battery.  It\'s very poor performance.  I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger and last very long time (now they no longer make this model).  One difference I could find is that the good one was made in Germany and poor one was made in China.  I am not saying this is the reason but I am certainly recommending don\'t buy this model if anyone is considering.  I will give this a rating of zero star if that\'s an option."

The brush head falls off the handle instead of snapping on like the genuine ones do. The brush dosent even make the same noise as it does with a genuine head, it sounds more rattly. I\'ve been reading that these heads fall apart in your mouth while brushing so I\'m returning mine before they have a chance to do that. Check out the pictures with the notes at the top of the page, the brush heads amazon sent me look identical the the knock-off ones. (Grey oral-b markings etc.)"

My mother spent a lot of money on me as a child; she paid for me to have braces two different times. I always want to have good teeth for aesthetic reasons, and also because my mom invested so much in my teeth even though paying for braces twice wasn\'t so easy for her. I figure it\'s the least I can do, considering what she did for me.I have been wanting a rechargeable toothbrush for a long time, and I wanted the best I could buy in the Oral B line. I kind of thought that $100 was pretty high for a toothbrush, but they are offering the 50% rebate right now. When I get the rebate check, I\'ll really only have $50 in it. And that\'s not a bad price for a product that helps you keep your mouth healthier. I would have eventually bought this toothbrush at full price without a rebate, but the 50% rebate really pushed me to go ahead and buy it now.I got my toothbrush about 4 days ago, and I absolutely love it so far. I feel like it does a much better job than a manual toothbrush ever could. I\'ve been brushing in the Deep Clean mode, which is 3 minutes. Sometimes I even continue brushing for a minute or two after the 3 minutes on the Smart Guide has passed. My teeth feel so smooth when I\'m finished brushing; it\'s amazing.I love the Smart Guide that comes with this toothbrush. The timer really helps you see how long to brush in each quadrant before moving on to the next. I feel like I\'m getting a professional cleaning at home.I read a lot of reviews on here before making my purchase, which was very helpful. I did read a few reviews where people had said they experienced some bleeding from their gums, but I haven\'t had any trouble with that at all.So far, I\'m thrilled with this toothbrush and hope it continues to impress me. My twice yearly dental cleanings/checkups are always great, but I\'m really anxious for my next visit to see if the hygienist notices less plaque buildup, etc.If you\'re thinking about a rechargeable toothbrush, this is an excellent choice. The rebate right now can\'t be beat either!"

2675,2744,20100826,B003UKKHB4,4,"August 26, 2010",A1RIQUDE4B8NGX,First time electric toothbrush user.,"After over 40 years of life, you sometimes find the need to try something new and different and abandon the habits of old. So goes my old fashioned \'manual\' toothbrush for a newfangled electric model. Okay, so I am not so old that I actually talk that way, but sometimes change is hard.As this is my first powered toothbrush, I cannot offer any comparison to models of old, but I can tell you that using the Oral-b 3000 is surely a different experience from just plain old brushing. First off, the round head shape definitely seems to do a great job of cleaning teeth; its shape allows for the bristles to envelope the tooth and I can feel its cleaning efforts at work. And, for those of you who have a tendency to scour their teeth with a toothbrush and scrape off the enamel, the Oral-b 3000 comes with a pressure sensor that will warn you when you are using too much force.Overall, my mouth feels cleaner after just a few days of use and I can tell it will likely make a difference in my dental hygiene.Something to note... If you have a high fear of dentists and their tools, then you should be aware that using the Oral-b 3000 will sound like you are in the dentist\'s chair. Nothing to fear, but it is a little shocking for the unprepared."
1106,1131,20080428,B000AUIFCA,4,"April 28, 2008",A3VYKXHQDICC6,OK,"I\'ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for the last 10+ years. Usually, I buy the regular, round Flexisoft brush heads. The last time I tried to purchase them, however, the store was out of stock. But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.They work well. They deliver that nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and expect from our Oral-B\'s. In this regard, they are at least the equivalent of the Flexisofts, and they may even be slightly superior.Braun embeds 4 little rubber \'paddles\' into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss. I can not detect any \'flossing\' from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess. It may be that the \'paddles\' do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell. They cause no discomfort. The brushing feels slightly different, but not unpleasant.The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers. Rather than being circular, like the regular heads, it is an oval. The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large. I think that one of the Oral-B\'s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth. That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.When I need to replace these, I will look for the regular Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. In my opinion, those are the best. But if I can\'t find them, I would not hesitate to buy these again.***UPDATE 2/2011: It amazes me, but there appears to be a *thriving* market in counterfeit Oral-B Brush Heads! I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon. Under the price, where it says \'Sold By\' make sure that it says \'Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\' If it doesn\'t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \'More Buying Choices,\' and see if you can find one that says Amazon. Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don\'t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon."

I mean, butterflies don\'t have teeth and they\'re still beautiful ...The toothbrush works great, and I\'ve tried my fair share of electric toothbrushes, I tend to stick with the Oral-B line but they tend to be on the weighty side and are not too comfortable to hold, this slim lined beauty makes being lazy OK.

(You still have to keep up the flossing, though!) I thought that the little clock/brushing guide would just be a useless gimmick, but I have actually found it helpful (it flashes a red warning if you use to much pressure on the brush, which lots of people tend to do). The brush performs beautifully, does what it\'s supposed to do effectively, and you can feel the results immediately. The smaller brush size is really great for accessing hard-to-reach places. I can\'t recommend this product highly enough - whether you choose the high-end model or more of an entry level one, it will not disappoint you. The shipping was incredibly fast, too."

I would skip 5000 with the Smartguide LCD and get the 4000 series instead. The LCD is a seriously useless gimmick IMO since the brush beeps every 30 seconds to let you know to move onto the next section.

It arrived within 7 days and I\'ve been using it ever since.  I originally had planned on purchasing a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush but after reading many different reviews, decided on the Oral-B instead.  The clock/timer is a nice feature, makes me more aware of how much time I spend on different sections of teeth.  The motor hesitates when too much pressure is applied which is also a plus for me as I have a tendency to press too hard.  I\'ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don\'t use the stand that it came with but it\'s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn\'t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I\'ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.  Also, I already received my refund card from P&G as well, which was much quicker than some other people had reported in their reviews.  I would definitely buy another if this one went bad and would recommend to anyone looking to purchase this type of toothbrush."

I bought this toothbrush after my Sonicare fell on the floor and never worked the same. I have been using a Crest Spinbrush since my Sonicare broke, which I hated. I have been using the Pulsonic for a few weeks now. This toothbrush is amazing! It is so light and slim, and I love the smaller brush attachment for the back teeth and in between teeth. When I am done my teeth feel so clean, like I just had them polished at the dentist! So far I like this toothbrush way more than the Sonicare, which was too heavy, the brush head was too large for my liking, and when you take it out of your mouth to spit, you (and the mirror) get splattered. That doesn\'t happen with the Pulsonic. Plus, you can\'t beat the price for the Pulsonic. My boyfriend is getting annoyed with me because every time I use it I tell him how much I love it. HaHa!
