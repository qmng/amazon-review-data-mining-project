After few weeks of light use, the brush head became loose and wobbling causing extra noise, it pinched my lips and tongue.  I am on the 3rd brush head now (out of the 4 pack I bought), they all broke the same way.I remembered I bought the 2 or 3 pack replacement brush head from Target before, they worked exactly like the original, but expensive.  That\'s why it was so tempting to get this cheap \'thought to be original\' alternative. Be aware!"

Use of the Oral B Sonic Complete has improved the health of my gums and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  I love the feature that tells you when to switch to the next quarter of your mouth.  When I first used it, I used the mid setting but now use the high setting.  The massage feature is also nice.  My husband and I both use the toothbrush."

As a result, we have always reverted back to using manual toothbrushes. A few months ago she came home with an Oral-B Smartseries 5000 kit from our dentist.  She loved it, plus the kit had lots of extra brushes, free mouthwash, etc, etc. The rebates and offers brought the price down to about 1/2. A great deal. I was skeptical at first but after trying it for awhile I also was impressed. I ordered one and have been very pleased. So we now have one in each bathroom. This is the first toothbrush system we have been totally satisfied with."

Saw it yesterday in Target for $159.99.  Also Oral-B is running a 1/2 special.  Mail in rebate for 1/2 off actual purchase price (before tax and shipping).  Toothbrush itself is quiet and powerful.

I bought this toothbrush because of the good reviews and there was a promotion for a 1/2 off rebate.  So, I only paid $51 for it after receiving the rebate.That being said, I really like this toothbrush and am very happy that I bought it.  It makes my mouth feel so much cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.I bought my 3 yr old son and 5 yr old daughter a Philips Sonicare for kids and tried that toothbrush.  I did not like the Sonicare toothbrush at all.  The sonicare toothbrush vibrates and it made my mouth feel numb even after I was done using it.  My son wouldn\'t even try the sonicare, and my daughter tried it, but didn\'t like it.  However, my daughter uses the Oral-B every night (She still uses her manual one once a day).  She says she likes the Oral-B.  I bought her some kids replacement heads (I found them on ebay for a really good price).  She likes the smiley face that shows up on the timer after you reach the two minutes.  She even used it longer to see if it would wink at her, which it does.  She watches the timer while I\'m brushing her teeth and I have never had a problem reaching the 2 minute brushing time.The toothbrush comes with a stand and a place to put four toothbrush heads which is nice.  I have two heads in there for me and one for my daughter.  Once I can convince my son to use the toothbrush, there will be space for his toothbrush head.  I really like the different colored rings that come with the toothbrush heads so that we can keep track of whose heads are whose.I am so glad that I bought this toothbrush and would definitely recommend it to others."
1440,1472,20101025,B001CX4JSS,3,"October 25, 2010",A1FX16U43P8T02,It\'s not my favorite but it works,"Revised after several months of use.I replaced my oral b sonic complete (which I really enjoyed using) with this one as the sonic complete is not being made any longer and any left over inventory is way overpriced.I don\'t love that this toothbrush feels like a jackhammer in my mouth, but I am now used to it after several months of use.  Yes, it has two settings but, it shouldn\'t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn\'t have to with their older model. The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting. There is also no indication that it is fully charged except by plugging it in when uncharged and timing it.  The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  I\'m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  I am now \'cost sensitive\' as I am only willing to spend so much to \'rent\' a unit for a couple of years (my older one lasted on the lower side of this equation) only to have to throw it and the useless, spare, brand new brushes I have away (it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit\'s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.On the plus side, it is very slim so it fits nicely in the hand and, I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once so, I suppose that jackhammer feeling of the brush obviously did not do any harm to the enamel as I had feared it would."
2874,2954,20100825,B003UKM90Q,4,"August 25, 2010",A203OCQQ12MAVT,a more gentle and still rechargable brush,"This was sort of a family review.  My father and I both adopted the philips sonicare system. I got this for my mom who has some sensitive gums that the sonicare irritated when she tried my dad\'s unit.  She is satisfied with the oral-b design.Over the sonicare, this has a smaller brush-head which can get into smaller places easier.Unlike the original oral b brushes, this is rechargable which is a major plus when you get halfway through brushing and the batteries suddenly die.Personally, my preference is for the sonicare system as it really cleans well, but even my father has tried this and thinks it might be doing a better job than the sonicare.Time will tell and I\'ll update my review with new info as the checkups come in.  Since we had used the AA battery verion before, we had extra brush-heads to all try the unit which is good in a family environment.  I think we felt the purchase price of the sonicare alot more since I don\'t live at home and had to buy my own.  I think the pricepoint oral b managed to hit at 1/4 the price of the sonicare system is a very affordable way for people to add a powered brush to their oral hygene."

I owned a sonicare and decided to get something with less expensive brusheads.  the Oral B Pulsonic worked fine for about 2 months....Then it would not stay OFF.  I would turn it off.....and set it on the recharging base....then after about 2 minutes it would turn on by itself.  Really bizarre.  Worst craftsmenship ive seen in any toothbrush.  The brush would no longer turn off when coming in contact with the charging base.  So finally after an hour of letting it run i finally just took it apart....and all the wiring inside was corroded.  I do not think this was designed to keep water out.  Very poor product.  Save your money and buy any other toothbrush.  Huge buyers remorse....I am considering never buying ORAL B products again......

I decided to go with a powered toothbrush because although I brush often, I don\'t usually brush well.  Fortunately I have great teeth but with too much yellow from all my coffee, etc.  I also travel alot and so don\'t always have time to get in for my 6 month cleanings.  After using this for a few short weeks, my teeth not only feel cleaner, but they are also getting whiter.  It doesn\'t get any better than this!"

It\'s lasted an amazingly long time; the battery has just recently started having trouble keeping a charge. (Mechanically, it still works perfectly.) So, I decided to try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush.Compared to the Sonicare, the Oral-b is quite different. It\'s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \'sonic\' movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts. The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \'floss action\' rubber points work quite differently as well. At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth. Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice. I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.(One small issue wroth noting: all the included tooth brush heads look the same. It\'s awkward to share between two people because the different heads look identical. It would be nice to have different colored heads, like Philips provides.)"

They are impossible to find locally anymore.In addition they don\'t fit the oral B handle as well as the originals, they are probably meant as a one size fits all arrangement, which they don\'t. Hence the three stars rating.After these wear out I\'ll probably have to find a new toothbrush altogether."

Fortunately, this model has a built-in timer, which notifies you that it\'s time to stop or you\'ll overdo it. That is a very nice feature. The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth. After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning. The brush is also smaller and requires you to use less toothpaste, which will result in savings over time. The only downside is that the brushes are a little on the pricey side, but I\'m hoping they last longer than my regular brush.If you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush. Not only does it do a great job at cleaning teeth, I\'m sure this will result in less cavities when I get my dental check-ups."

I give the Oral-B Braun lots of stars for ease of use, dependability and it gets in to those hard to reach places with the small round head. The only negative thing I have is that the new stand for it is not as sturdy as the old one and I miss that little green light telling me it is sitting correctly. All in all its a 5 star item.

It does not have the power controls of the previous models, nor does it have the timer function that lets you know when it\'s time to move to another part of your mouth. Despite these differences, my wife says that it cleans better while using the same brushes as its predecessor. The motor is stronger than the previous one was when it was new. Her teeth feel cleaner using the same dentifrice. It\'s compact, including the charger. Overall, it\'s inexpensive and works well."

They were both rated highly, but had an older version of a Sonicare for 6 years that putter out.  So I opted for this new Oral-B, and what a pleasant surprise!The coffee stains on the backside of my teeth that the Sonicare couldn\'t get, are disappearing w/this toothbrush.  Although it could be said that the Oral-B\'s smaller toothbrush head makes you brush longer (Sonicare\'s toothbrush head is larger) and or reaches hard to clean areas. Either way, the stains are going away now since I brush a Minimum of 4 minutes 2 X\'s a day (w/Sonicare I brushed the standard 2 minutes 2X\'s a day).Thanks Oral-B!

I have an electric toothbrush that still charges fully and functions as new 10 years later! I say the same for their shavers.  This filter, ever after YOU break it WILL deliver the same coffee taste/strength.  Beyond durability, this filter\'s appeal also stems from the size of the holes in their mesh, which as mentioned in numerous other reviews, will give you an extra 8oz cup of coffee over paper.  Tip, if you want it to last 5 years or more, remove it and clean it soon after making your coffee, at the latest, when you have finished all the coffee in the carafe.  DO NOT bang it against anything to remove the old grind and DO NOT leave the hot soggy grind in the filter for any length of time, and NO dishwasher!  To prevent the oil build-up on the mesh, simply rinse with cool water outside-in ASAP, and place upside down in natural lit area so as to prevent mold. As mentioned before, the mesh even without the plastic support frame or gold finish will deliver the quality coffee taste as when new and outlive all your coffee makers and your taste buds too!"

I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use. This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED. I was initially disappointed as I realized I had a brush head that didn\'t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed. URGH... I decided to give it the weekend before trying to call customer service on Monday to get a replacement. However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions. When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean! Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush (forgot what they call it) and the fact that it continues to brush past 2 minutes. The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines. And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!! And an added bonus is that the replacement heads are even less expensive and the brush it self had a $15 rebate so less than the cheapest Sonicare too.And I\'ve only had it 4-5 days now but I am certain my teeth are already whiter than they were and less stained!!"

Thanks to lots of coffee and tea, I can *see* ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health.  Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth are back to normal now.I would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).

Clearly they got the source of the stain wrong, and I\'m not so sure about the brush.My research led to the purchase of the Oral-B 3000.Oral-B and Sonicare seem the brushes of choice, and my research gave Oral-B a slight edge, though I\'m reconsidering. Reading reviews also gave the Oral-B floss action brush head a slight edge, and I\'m inclined to agree; though it certainly doesn\'t replace regular flossing, so far it seems to be keeping the staining abated.The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist\'s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. Primarily, the mode switch is a source of frustration, for the brush can not be shut off without going through all three modes. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000."

After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can\'t see because it\'s inside the column. It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next day.The directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable. I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000% markup.I tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.Caveat emptor."

So I\'ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea. It\'s now just a question of which one to get.In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh. We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it\'s doing a great job. It\'s not \'too mild\'. Our dentist praises us on how well our teeth are cared for. I don\'t see the need for the extra agitation this unit gives.There are no LEDs anywhere that we can see to indicate this unit is charging. It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn\'t being wasted.There\'s similarly no battery indicator.Finally, with the Sonicare, you get a blink every 30 seconds to change mouth quadrants. That way at the end of 2 minutes you know you\'ve handled each quadrant evenly. With this one, you solely get a buzz at the end of 2 minutes to tell you you\'re done. So you have to manage your time yourself. I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually - but there\'s many features they left out."

I had one in a drawer that cost under $20 that I never used because it was heavy and loud so I always thought I would stick to a manual toothbrush, much to the consternation of my dentist.  After reading a few reviews and talking to my hygenist I decided on the Oral-B 5000 and love it!  At first it seemed like way too much technology for something so basic, but after the short read through the manual and letting it charge I was ready to go and it only took a few uses to get the hang of.  The manual was very easy to read and understand and didn\'t really take that long to review.  Another reason that I decided on the Oral-B was because of the smaller head of the brush.  A friend of mine with another brand toothbrush said that she wishes that she had thought of that when she purchased hers.  It really is a great toothbrush and I do really feel that it deep cleans.  My only complaint about the toothbrush is that it is sort of loud, but on the sensitive setting it isn\'t too bad.  But if you need help waking up in the morning...maybe the noise will help!  Overall I really do love it and see it as a good investment into my oral hygiene."

Ok not really but it is a sweet little tooth brush. I love that it\'s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue you can put it on soft mode. The charger you see in the picture can actually come apart so you are left with a tiny stand if you want instead of the big face. The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist saying \'you\'re brushing your teeth too hard\' which can be very bad for you. Finally the cost. You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning. My mouth was a little sore but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \'I bet you haven\'t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\' I actually told him that wasn\'t true...I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing. My teeth feel the same as going to a dentist (plus I floss twice a day), every day..what more can you ask for.Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes... you get what you pay for period. People my age find this expensive, but the investment again is just a win-win that pays for itself right away. Did I mention is also really does help whiten teeth with the special head? yeah that\'s awesome also!...oh and the charge really does last all week"

I wore the tip out within a few weeks. The only replacement heads for this toothbrush have three regular brushes and only a single precision tip. I searched high and low for just replacement precision tips - nothing on line. Called Oral-B they told me to get a head that does not work with this vibrating toothbrush. When I called them back they apologetically agreed that there was no other way to get additional precision tips without getting three regular toothbrush heads - a complete waste.So if you want to get this toothbrush because of the extra precision head to take care of your gums - look elsewhere.

1827,1872,20100605,B002HWS9FW,5,"June 5, 2010",AYKFU65ZXNKSN,Buy it. No regrets  at  all.,"***Just an update: If you do not like sonic toothbrushes like me,  this  one is for you. Very affordable; it has  a 2 min time built in; a set of 2 AA alkaline batteries last close to 2 months without the loss of speed (some technology built-in do that), but make sure you grease  battery cap o-ring before you close or it will crack after some time (it happened  to me); it lasts  forever  and it does the  same  job as  the  much more expensive Oral-B in the market. Dito.I have posted the same review for the oral-b vitality toothbrush, but it is related to the pro-health model as well.I\'ve been brushing my teeth wih oral-b for over 10 years now, and they are all similar to  the vitality model.  I\'ve  always used the least expensive model since I see no difference from the expensive ones, unless you are looking for \'extras\', like timer, lcd screen, etc. The vitality is a very good brush. I use the round head instead of the elongated.  I rather brush my teeth with oral-b than any other eletric brush on the market. The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well. Oral-B  entry level eletric brushes are the way to  go. I can\'t brush my teeth with regular toothbrush anymore. Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but saty way from the  cheap kind. They are knock-offs  and last less  than a month. The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more. The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings. I think this is annoying. I didn\'t want to leave the brush recharging after every use. So I bought the ORAL-B Pro-Health that uses two AA batteries. It is simply AMAZING. The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better. The batteries lasts forever on the pro-health. I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months. It is the best.  The vitality rechargeable brush gets very slow after 3-4 days. Not with the pro-health. Buy the  pro-health. It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design. Another thing is ORAL-B equipment lasts forever. I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me. And since they are the entry level brushes, I just buy another one of  the same. No need to buy another battery.Again, go with the ORAL-B PRO-HEALTH eletric toothbrush."

Gets my teeth very clean, more so than any other brush in the Oral-B line up (and I\'ve tried every one!). The size is a bit larger than the regular model, but still remains sufficiently maneuverable. The hardest area to hit is behind the front teeth. It can be done, but there\'s more of a mess than with the smaller brushes.My only complaint is that they are a bit rougher on the gum line than the Ultrasoft Oral-B model. So, I switch off between the two - couple of days with the Floss Action, then a couple of days with the Ultrasoft.Great price if you catch it on one of the price dips. Highly recommend."

When it finally died, I broke open its Fort Knox-like enclosure only to discover two rechargeable AA batteries.  I vowed not to give them any more of my business, if I could avoid it.Then, I bought this one.  I liked the size, though it took a little while to adjust to the feel of it.

It doesn\'t last as long between charges (approximately 1/2 as long, 5 days instead of 10 days), and you\'ll need to be careful about letting it discharge once in a while because of the memory effect of NiCd batteries.It also lacks a lot of the frills of the other toothbrush. No LED light to indicating charging / charge full, and it does not pulse at 30 second intervals when brushing. It does pulse at the end of 2 minutes though.The brushing action is also different from the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush. The brushing action feels weaker, though I must admit the teeth feels just as clean afterwards. I tried the same toothbrush head on them - they appear to be interchangeable. I\'ve also tried the original toothbrush head. I can\'t judge effectiveness (they appear to all clean well) but the one that came with the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush feels more comfortable to me - better contact with the teeth.This toothbrush is significantly lighter, but otherwise the construction looks to be about the same level as the other one.I\'m giving it 4 stars despite the shortcomings because it is significantly cheaper than the other toothbrush. I think they balance each other out (I\'d rate my existing toothbrush 4 stars as well).For me at least, an electric toothbrush cleans teeth much better than manual brushing and although I\'m definitely not a dentist, I recommend them."

At the time I was 3 months pregnant - as any dentist will tell you, your oral health tends to decline during pregnancy, due to various reasons.  Already I had a lot of tartar buildup and some places to watch.  Well, immediately after my check up I started using the Sonic Complete.  I love that it times the brushing for you, 30 seconds per quadrant, so you do a thorough job.  Last week I went back to the dentist for my 6-month followup, now 9 months pregnant, and anticipating the worst - but it was the best check up I\'ve ever had.  The cleaning was a breeze - I had hardly any buildup and everything looked great.  The hygienist couldn\'t believe it, especially given my pregnancy, and agreed with me that it must be the toothbrush.  So I\'m hooked!

2360,2415,20101002,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 2, 2010",A277KHX8TFTC58,Fantastic,"I\'ve gotta say, this Oral-B Smart Series 5000 electric toothbrush is incredible.  I was skeptical because I have been using its direct competitor for about a year, the top-of-the-line Sonicare Flexcare HX6950 with UV Sanitizer, and was very happy with that brush.  A friend of mine has the Oral-B smart series, and when I saw it, I knew I had to give it a try to see what all the hype was about.  I found the opportunity when my father asked me to order him one, so I threw in an extra one for myself.  It arrived in two days from Amazon, brand spanking new.I\'ve used the Orab-B for about a week, 14 times, and I have to say its different than the Sonicare, not necessarily better, but just different, and just as good.  The Oral-B gives you a different kind of clean, and I definitely feel my teeth and gums get a really, really good cleaning after brushing.  My teeth also seem whiter now.  I think the Oral-B removes more plaque off my teeth, and more food from between my teeth due to the optional Floss Action brush head I\'ve been using.  Don\'t be fooled, there is no substitution for flossing, but this brush head does a little for you, especially if you have bigger natural gaps between your teeth, of which I don\'t, so I have to floss.  The Floss Action brush head is really amazing, quite an innovation, and I love it.The wireless SmartGuide is pretty clever too.  It automatically goes on when you turn your toothbrush on.  I can definitely say, that the SmartGuide helps you to brush longer and more thoroughly.  Its almost like a trainer when your brushing, rooting for you to finish 30 seconds on each setting.  I do one cycle for the top teeth, and one cycle for the bottom teeth.  The SmartGuide is very helpful to anyone, no matter your age.  The four different stages of this electric toothbrush are also very helpful, I use them all, and always will.The Oral-B Smart Series 5000 comes with one Floss Action brush head, and one Pro White brush head.  I also ordered a 4 pack of sensitive brush heads, but haven\'t used them yet.  In addition, after seeing how much I like the Floss Action brush head, I ordered more of those, a 3 pack actually.  If your wondering about the price, forget about it, its totally worth it, and will probably save you thousands of dollars worth of needless dental work due to cavities.  I can\'t recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush enough.  In fact, if you have the money, be generous and buy them for other people that can\'t afford one.  Everyone should be able to use one of these, they are that beneficial to oral hygiene.  I can\'t imagine using a regular toothbrush after using an electric one, especially an electric on of this quality.As usual, Amazon is amazing for price, shipping, product quality, and customer service, literally the best store on the planet.  I don\'t even understand how other stores can stay in business with Amazon in existence.  I stopped keeping track of how much money I\'ve spent here in the past 10 years..lol."

It\'s an electric toothbrush that\'s about the same size a conventional toothbrush!And it does a good job of cleaning my teeth. I\'ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I\'m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance. It\'s a mighty little toothbrush.The one and only drawback I\'ve found -- and it\'s a small one --  is that unlike the Sonicare the Pulsonic doesn\'t have a 2 minute timer. Instead it has a 30 second timer.  You have to count to four without electronic assistance (Four 30-sec treatments equal 2 minutes which is my Dentist\'s recommended brushing time.)Also as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars. Most toothbrushes -- both electric and non-electric -- fail this test. So that\'s another big plus.So in a nutshell, if you\'re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel), small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all."

Batteries last 3-5 years (meaning 3 years), AND once the battery is exhausted and no longer holds a charge, you have to throw away the entire unit.The company\'s explanation is that the unit is water tight so removing the battery breaks that seal. This is horrific design flaw - if they wanted they could allow for battery replacement.BUT...allowing battery replacement means you wouldn\'t have to BUY AN ENTIRE NEW UNIT.So...essentially the consumer is being held hostage to a company that\'s designed a product that has to be thrown away.LASTLY...there is no easy means of recycling. I was told I had to go to a Braun service center. On Long Island. 30+ miles away. That\'s irresponsible. A company should stand behind their product; offer, at the very least, a reasonable outlet to recycle something.

Overall, we are both very satisfied with this product.Product Details and background for my review--------------------------------------------I have owned Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  I have owned a previous generation of Oral-B electric brush some years ago and found the build quality was poor when compared to Sonicare. Sonicare employs a rapid vibration of the brush head to generate sonic waves which dislodge plaque from teeth.  The Oral-B brush has a small, round head that rotates back and forth (It does not do full rotations.  If I had to guess about how much it rotates before it switches directions, I would guess somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees).  The package says that in clinical studies it improves gum health better than Sonicare advance.  I cannot provide feedback on this as I have not been to the dentist since I have been using the Oral-B and even if I had been, the results of that visit would not be guaranteed to be related to the brush itself.THE GOOD--------This toothbrush is very well constructed.  This new model has excellent build quality throughout.My teeth feel smoother after using the Oral-B than after using my Sonicare.  I thought I was imagining it and didn\'t mention it to my wife but when she approached me telling me her teeth feel cleaner and smoother, I was convinced that the mechanical performance of the brush was better at cleaning the teeth.  So far the battery performance is very good but it is a new brush so I expect it to be so.  It has a pacing mode similar to Sonicare\'s in that it gives the user feedback every 30 seconds (the brush head stops moving momentarily.  Sonicare beeps in this case, but I don\'t think this is a plus or minus for either brush).  I did like that the Oral-B will let you go beyond the 2 minutes (30 seconds for each quadrant of the mouth).  The Sonicare makes you start it again as it shuts off after 2 minutes.  I brush my teeth for 2 minutes and then brush my tongue so I find the fact that the Oral-B continues to run after 2 minutes is a plus.  The brush heads are cheaper than Sonicare and they have different kinds (basic cleaning, floss action -- which has little rubber floss picks in the head).  This brush gives you feedback when you press too hard.  My Sonicare Elite does not do this.  Cleanup is \'slightly\' more difficult with the Oral-B but the way the head connects is better making overall cleanup much better.  The Sonicare has a deep plastic well that houses the magnets that cause the pulsing.  Liquids (water, saliva, toothpaste) can get in there and it is not easy to get it out fully, even with a Q-tip.  Over time, this can cause mildew, so I have had to use a q-tip in alcohol to solve this.  The way the Oral-B is designed, this would never happen, you just remove the head, rinse it and give the brush a quick wipe on a towel.  The design is very good and supports easy cleanup.  I hesitate to put the wireless remote brush monitor in the \'Good\' category, as I don\'t like it, but some people who are really gadget-heads might enjoy this.  Basically it is a small LCD display that shows you where you are in the brushing cycle and gives you a visual cue when you\'re brushing too hard.  The brush itself gives you this feedback though, so I think this wireless thing is kind of \'hokey\' and when the batteries die, I\'ll likely toss it in the box and throw it under the stairs.  The good thing about it is that both my wife\'s brush and mine connect to a single wireless display without \'pairing\'.  I haven\'t tried to use it at the exact same time as her, but this obviously would not work.  It has tiny integrated legs so that you can lay it down on its side without it rolling away.THE BAD-------There is a \'mode\' button that lets you cycle through the five brushing modes.  It is right where I naturally want to put my thumb so I have had to train myself to put my thumb elsewhere so I don\'t keep changing modes while I brush.  It is much louder than my Sonicare  The Sonicare works by a magnet turning on and off rapidly so there is no connection between the brush head and the \'motor\'... In the Oral-B, there is basically a tiny axle that connects the motor to the brush head.  This is inherently noisier than the Sonicare design.  I don\'t find it terrible though.  I do not find the wireless lcd display to be useful.  Everything it provides can (and is) provided by feedback in the toothbrush itself.  The wireless lcd display is just another thing to clutter your bathroom vanity.  With that said, the pricing does not make it feel as if I paid extra for the lcd display so I am not too concerned about it.THE UGLY--------Nothing about this toothbrush was terribleOther things to considerThe brush has various modes (high speed, lower speed, one that slowly goes from gentle to vigorous and back, one that pulses, etc.  I believe there are 5 such modes).  I do not use them because my gums and teeth are not sensitive so I use the vigorous mode full-time but maybe somebody with sensitive gums would want the pulsing mode so they could have some gum stimulation without over-doing it."

We thought we\'d give the Oral B a fling when the Sonicare didn\'t seem to be doing the job recently. This thing is simply amazing. It\'s so superior to the Sonicare I can\'t begin to tell you. It feels like you just left the dwentist after a very thorough cleaning each time you use it.If I could offer one suggestion it sould be that they should inform the purchaser in a much more prominant way that when you plug the charger in and put the unit in the base there is no indication it\'s getting any charge. I was about to return the unit thinking it was defective when, to my amazement, the charging indication finally came on AFTER the unit had been in the charging cradle for about 10 minutes. I would imagine that many folks will plug it in, put the unit in the charger, see no indication of charging and promptly return the unit as \'defective.\' it\'s not. That\'s how long it takes when you charge it for the first time to \'connect\' with the charger. The instruction manual should make this much, much more clear.Amazing product and a steal at the price."

Very fast vibrations with smooth brushing action.2. Rechargeable. Lasts 1 week per charge.3. Can change out the brush heads when they wear out.4. Charging base is clean with no exposed metal parts to rust or get corroded.CONS:1. Brush head is small for me. The crossfire brush has a larger surface area and gets more teeth at a time.2. Uses Ni Cad batteries instead of Lithium battery.3. Replacement heads are very expensive. You could get two heads and the toothbrush for the same price as the three pack of replacement heads.BOTTOM LINE:Excellent power toothbrush. Gets your teeth cleaner than regular brushing.Would have given it five stars if the replacement brushes weren\'t so expensive.

It replaced my manual toothbrush years ago and has been very satisfactory. I do a fair amount of traveling and have been using an inexpensive, grocery store purchased AA battery powered model that has provided fair results.I have been using the vitality in my travels and am very pleased with the results. It has the dual heads that leave my mouth tasting fresh and clean and is far superior to the grocery store offering. To be sure it is much more expensive but the results, to me, are worth the extra cost. In addition to the dual head brush the timer is a nice touch and I have found that while it says the battery requires 16 hours to charge that apparently means to fully charge. I use the Vitality every morning and night during my travels and plug it in when checking into the motel room and find it always has an adequate charge.I agree with other reviewers that a travel case would be very handy as would a light indicating when the unit is charged. I am a bit worried about the battery used by OralB in this product after reading another reviewers comments as to the battery being of old technology and perhaps not as good as AA batteries. I intend to continue to use this unit extensively and will see how the battery performs. If there is a significant failure of some type I will update this review.So, overall I am pleased with this unit and recommend it without reservations except for the battery issue which may or may not be a problem. So far it has been far superior to my grocery store brands."

He recommended to me these following products:1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson & Johnson5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.This is the regiment he advised me to follow:1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it\'s the best time of day for using fluoride.3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \'glides\' right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \'grips\' the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it\'s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don\'t even think about it!5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don\'t have to wonder \'did I brush good enough\'. It tells you when you are done!CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  Once you get through \'the tunnel\' using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care!I wish you happy, healthy teeth!"

Wish I had read more reviews before buying two! This happened to me and my husband when he tried his...it is really easy to twist ever so slightly while brushing which pops head off. It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on. Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth. Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode. Returning two of these and will probably go back to Sonicare for next purchase."

They are something that I happen to know very well. The product that I received came in a packaging that while different from what I am used to, still had the OralB logo, that I was familiar with. I figured that maybe there was just a difference in packaging for online markets. Well I guess that I should have questioned things more because I am convinced that I could not have received authentic OralB Floss Action brush heads. The brush heads I got all broke very soon after beginning to use them. I usually get about three months from each brush head as is indicated on the packaging for the heads. With these here, the brush heads all started coming loose easily move back and forth after only a few weeks. This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing. That was not enjoyable! I would say that these brush heads were either some kind of knock-off, or maybe someone found a way to sell the brush heads that were rejected in production. I guess that the lower than usual price for them should have been the first thing to question. I won\'\'t make the same mistake again."

I am very happy to have it.- It takes 2 AA rechargeable batteries. A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks. (it depends on how long your batteries hold the charge). Alkaline batteries last a month. So it is very useful for traveling.- Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken. Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.- If you want to save the environment and you don\'t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans then you don\'t like toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries. It is very hard to remove the batteries from the unit to handle them properly.- This is the least expensive electric toothbrush from Oral-B. But it performs really well.- This toothbrush uses the same refill brushes that other expensive models use. So you get similar result for much less money.Con:- This one does not have a timer. You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.- People reported that this toothbrush lasts from 1 to 2 years. Well, the most expensive (about 9 times more expensive) Oral-B electric toothbrush lasts from 3 to 5 years.

I\'m contemplating buying a third electric toothbrush to keep in my second home (my husband will probably take his with him, but mine doesn\'t have a traveling case, and with all I take back and forth, it\'s just as easy to keep one in each place).

I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth. I have been using these heads for almost 10 years and often get compliments at the dentist. Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums. Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best. I\'m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn\'t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth & gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.I do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect. I\'ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months. I find that the blue begins to fade after one month. I think I\'m an average brusher (twice or more daily) and I even have two toothbrushes I switch between (depending on which is charged & what bathroom I\'m in), so I would think that the indicator would last longer.This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE! Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (& recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual. (If you\'re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve. They sell plates, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, razors, etc. & I do really like their razors) I know that plastic recycling isn\'t the best thing for the environment, but it\'s gotta be better than throwing all these heads in the trash/dump/ocean... I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they\'re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.) But, I can only keep so many. Anyway, that\'s why I give this product 4 stars, instead of 5. Gentle, but wish they were recycled & recyclable.Many thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)"

With an \'old fashioned\' toothbrush, I always looked for the most bristles I could find so I was surprised to discover I actually prefer the smaller Oral B toothbrush head to this one!!  The simple reason is that with the smaller head (with just the cicle of bristles), I feel like I have more control and can really get around my back teeth.  This will really boil down to preference for anyone.  I\'m sure both are great at getting your teeth clean.  But for me, I am going to stick with the standard head that comes with the toothbrush."

The fakes are also getting very hard to spot, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page for the \'floss action\' had were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference is in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. I personally wouldn\'t buy from Amazon because it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off may be similar in quality.I bought several different brush heads from Amazon this Christmas, and all appear to be fakes.

These toothbrushes also feature  electronics that keep the motor voltage constant - and hence maintain optimal orbital brushing speed - even as the battery voltage declines as they discharge. So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops. So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries! This feature also means despite the lower voltage of using 2x 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, you get the same brushing speed and power as using 2x 1.5V Alkaline cells. This is great! as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.Build quality of the units is great as you\'d expect for a Braun, even for a cheaper unit. The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section. This guarantees moisture vapour can\'t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term service.The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can\'t get into the internals.The 2-minute timer is a nice feature. At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing but if you wan\'t to keep brushing, you can as it doesnt turn the motor off.Overall this brush is great, especially for the price. The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific. The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber. All these problems are remedied with this Braun model."

The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  It\'s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  And children may find it more fun to use.How many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  Typical for Oral B\'s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn\'t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  Separate on and off buttons, are located on the handle.The Pulsar is being packaged and sold in various quantities.  At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B\'s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work."

I have resisted this purchase for years, but it has become apparent that I really needed to get one.  Research indicated that this was the best brush as far as effectiveness.I\'m not all that excited about vibrating toothbrushes--reminds me a lot of going to the dentist.  But this really isn\'t so bad.  I was a little skeptical--but after feeling the \'dentist clean\' feeling, I was sold.  I love that the brush stops if i try to brush too hard.  the little display that shows the quadrants and how long you are brushing is a little helpful--although certainly not a selling feature in my book.  funny though, i found as did many reviewers, that this serves as a great bathroom clock!The information on amazon can be a bit confusing.  You get a travel case, charger, 2 brush tips (1 pro white and 1 floss), and the display.The handle is a bit on the large size and i\'m not sure it would be good for children.  I prefer smaller handles, however, they can\'t fit all that computer programming into a smaller handle.You do have to practice a bit at keeping your mouth closed enough that the toothbrush doesn\'t spray.  But it has never been a real issue for me--i would say any spray has been minimal.  And every electric toothbrush has this issue.I prefer the smaller brush head on these to the larger brush heads.  on normal toothbrushes I prefer full size brush heads--but when you have a large handle, it seems much more maneuverable to have the smaller head.  And it doesn\'t feel stranger or bother me--i adapted on first use.When you are done using, it is best to remove brush from handle and thoroughly run it under water.  This can prevent toothpaste from building up.Oral B has a 60 day try it guarantee and will refund your money if you are not happy.  That seems like a good deal."

I bought direct, not through a 3rd party seller, and I received a fake product both for this head, and for the pro white as well. The fakes are also getting very hard to spot apparently, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct.

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for four Flexisoft EB17 heads for $24.99 (The EB17-4 just means there are four of them).  There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $12.99.

The Oral-B Professionals have the circular brush head and work differently than the Pulsonic or Philips\'s Sonicare toothbrushes.  Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I\'m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.The Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  It\'s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  The brush head of the Pulsonic is a breeze to take on and off; you slide it onto the unit and then give it a quarter-twist.  The brush head locks into place.  I hate how the brush head gets stuck on my Professional model, so this is a big advantage of the Pulsonic.  The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there\'s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  When it\'s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional\'s circular head.  The Pulsonic assists in cleaning by sending out sonic pulses, similar to a jewelry sonication cleaner.  This is used to blast off debris and break up bacteria biofilms that are populating your teeth and gums.  The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  Here\'s where I feel is the key difference that should determine which type of toothbrush you should get.  I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  The Pulsonic requires you to make tiny circular motions over your teeth and assists your cleaning with the sonic vibrations.  The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don\'t get me wrong, it\'s much better than a manual toothbrush.  But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  I\'ve never had a cavity, but the dentist always complains that my gums are a little too puffy or too red.  After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  I don\'t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.The other thing I\'ll mention about the Pulsonic is the base.  The base has a small footprint size and the Pulsonic simply rests in a small hole in the base.  It\'s a bit wobbly, but it works alright.  The problem I have, however, is that there are only two spots for brush heads.  The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have their own brush head(s) it\'s an annoying inconvenience.So I think the choice is up to your specific needs.  If you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush and commonly have cavity problems, then maybe you want to go with one of the high-end Oral-B models that have a circular head.  If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I\'d recommend the Pulsonic.  I\'m not a dentist, so that\'s just my opinion.  For my needs, though, I\'ll be sticking with the Pulsonic.UPDATE:I went to the dentist recently for my standard 6-month check-up.  I\'ve never had cavity problems before, but the dentist had always warned me that my gums and gum pockets were borderline beginning to show problems.  Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  While the hygienist was cleaning my teeth she asked, \'do you use an electric toothbrush?\'  When I replied yes, she said, \'yeah, I can tell.\'  So, there ya go.  I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they\'ve been in in years.  With that, I\'ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush."

I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.While I have no complaints about its power, the fact that it utilizes two cleaning brushes gives it a much larger brushing surface than with the single brush found on my Soniccare.  While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist."

After the first brushing I noticed both a changed in the appearance of my teeth and they felt cleaner. And every subsequent brushing yields whiter teeth. The freshness and invigorated sensation felt after brushing lasts until you eat.  The brush really does cup each tooth for that dentist office clean feel. The toothbrush boasts three speeds, for daily cleaning, whitening and sensitive which are easy to switch between. This toothbrush held a charge for hours, and the box comes with a convenient combo charger and toothbrush holder.  The box only includes one replaceable head, but replacement prices are reasonable, and I plan on buying the heads for my entire family.  The size of the brush is a little longer than would seem necessary, but it is no challenge to reach back teeth.  There is no one I would not recommend this toothbrush to.

It was nothing to write home about and was very basic compared to what is available these days. Once the battery went dead, I just went back to a manual toothbrush. I decided after my dentist appointment that my wife and I went to a couple weeks ago and having to pay $70(times 2) out of pocket as my copay for a deep cleaning for each of us to remove build up under the gums that I would see what was available in a rechargeable. It was a toss up as my dentist recommended both Oral-B, but only carried SonicCare with a $15 rebate at the front counter for sale. While at the Dentist office, I did enter a drawing for their top of the line SonicCare FlexCare Plus with Sanitizer by donating some can food for a local food bank for Thanksgiving. I am the type of guy that if I brought 999 cans and had a 999 out a thousand chance would not win in a drawing. I went home....researched both brands....read tons of reviews and checked the pricing on Amazon. The Oral-B reviews were consistly higher and the price with the 50% rebate on this model made it a hands down easier decision. This professional care toothbrush normally $159.99 retail was on Amazon last Wednesday for $104.99. I purchased 2 sets. They arrived at my door yesterday, with the free shipping and no sales tax. I was impressed when I opened them as to all that was included. My mindset was ....wow....only $50 for all this per set after rebate. It comes with at nice durable blue travel case that houses the toothbrush, and 2 brush heads. A nice travel charger that is multi-voltage and will work in other countries such as UK or Australia. It even came with an extra set of duracell batteries for the remote control clock/timer. I thought that was a nice touch that they would include those. The rechargable toothbrushes were both battery dead, so I set one up in each bathroom, and let them charge overnight to full charge. I used mine first thing this morning and was pleasantly surprised as to how easy and proficient it was brushing...I mean.... 30000 brush stokes per minute is 500 per second and I know I was never doing that manually. It comes with two different styled toothbrushes...one round and one flossing type. The flossing type is my favorite as it actually is flossing while brushing, so it is a 2 in 1 brush. Your teeth will feel like you just had them professionally cleaned at the dentist office. That nice squeaky sound when you touch your teeth with your finger. The toothbrush has like 5 settings for brushing from Sensitive to Deep Clean. The default setting worked perfectly for my teeth and gums. The little handy remote control timer......sits to the side and not only gives you the time of day, but when you turn on the toothbrush it automatically starts a 2 minute timer or 3 minute depending on how you set it up and times you on a 2 minute timer to 30 seconds per quadrant and lets you know when to move to the next set of teeth in the next quadrant and gives you a smiley face when you are done.  Funny, as I was typing this review I got a phone call from my dentist telling me that I won the raffle for the $189.99 Sonic FlexCare+ with sanitizer and that I could come pick it up. While I have never won anything before I am more hyped up on the Oral B and will likely just sell the SonicCare FlexCare+ on Craigslist for more than I paid for both of my Oral B\'s together. I apologize if this was too wordy. I am not a professional writer and I base what I buy off of what others write and just did not want to miss anything."

It shows too much \'brushing too hard\' signals even when I used it very gently. And I don\'t think following the guide is any good because you may not have enough time to clean a quarter very well, and you have your own order of brushing teeth.

I found the best value on Amazon by BelowCostJML. They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&H for my whole shipment. (I ordered 5x the item of 6 brushes/ea, so 3 bucks S&H for 30 brush heads).Other sellers came somewhat close in pricing but wanted $7-10 S&H fees, not to mention that some would limit you to 1 item (of 3 brushes)/order. So if I wanted to increase the quantity to get the 30 brush heads I got from BelowCostJML, I would have to literally place the order 10 times and pay the ludicrous S&H cost 10x!I\'m thankful for BelowCostJML\'s fair pricing, including S&H and for their great service! The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time. Very pleased with the service!The product speaks for itself, I\'ve been a satisfied user for 8 years and I personally find it gentler in the mouth than Sonicare [I\'ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque (it\'s just a matter of each individual\'s preference)... I guess the \'difference\' would be equivalent to Pepsi versus Coke if you will (not that I\'m encouraging regular consumption of either): they give you the same overall effect, it just depends which one you prefer best. Hope this helped. Happy brushing (and don\'t forget to floss, too). :-)"

I wasn\'t sure if a hundred dollar toothbrush was for me, as I was in the practice of using a regular toothbrush for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time (while I surfed the net, usually), so I thought I was doing ok.  Let me tell you, this Oral-B feels AWESOME and it really makes my mouth feel cleaner in a shorter period of time!  I tried using my old toothbrush again, just to see, and it didn\'t feel right.  I\'ll never go back!!I usually use the regular (30 seconds per quadrant) clean in the morning and the extended (45 seconds per quadrant) clean at night.  After the last alert goes off I usually spend about another minute or so hitting the tongue, roof and cheeks, as well as a quick run around the base of the teeth and gums.  Feels great!As far as cleaning the brush, I let it run for a little under running water, then I remove the brush head and rinse the inside.  I then dry both using a towel, then keep them separate to air-dry a little more.  So far that keeps me from worrying about stuff growing inside or anything like that."

The polishing head is amazing, with the right toothpaste it feels like a dentist\'s cleaning! The flossing head seems to do its job, the long rubber flappers seem to reach further into the crevices between my teeth than an average toothbrush, although it is no substitute for actually flossing. Within the first couple days of owning this toothbrush I can already notice a difference in  my teeth, they feel amazingly clean and already look a touch whiter.

As for those who complain about it being too messy or taking too much effort to use, maybe they just don\'t want to put out any effort at all.  Turn it on, move it around, rinse it, wipe it off with a towel and put it back in the base, which could be a little more stable, but works just fine."

I thought I\'d try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush since the price fits our budget better. Unfortunately, I think the Sonicare experience set the bar too high and the Oral-b toothbrush did not meet my expectations.Oral-b features I liked:-Lightweight (lighter than the Sonicare)-Compact head-Bristles rotate and get in between teeth fairly well, but seem a little harsh along the gum line-InexpensiveHere\'s how the Sonicare one is better than the Oral-b one:-The Sonicare has a slimmer brush head \'neck\' between the bristles and the base/handle; the Oral-b one feels awkward because it\'s thicker-Sonicare has adjustable timing in 30 second increments up to 3 minutes, with auto shut-off; Oral-b has an alert that goes off at 2 minutes, but it doesn\'t turn off and it\'s not adjustable-The Sonicare brush/bristles have a plastic cover for when toothbrush is not in use; Oral-b just stays exposed when not in use, much like a regular toothbrush-The Oral-b toothbrush is louder than the Sonicare toothbrushOverall, I felt like my teeth were very clean, except along the gum line where I was hesitant to direct the Oral-b brush since it\'s a little harsher than my Sonicare (and I have sensitive gums already). I think it does a better job cleaning teeth than a standard toothbrush. It takes a little getting used to, but it\'s a step towards healthier oral care if you don\'t already use an electric toothbrush."
2257,2309,20120223,B002HWS9GG,4,"February 23, 2012",A2UOER2B3KUN9S,A Bit Different than the Sonicare,"Previously I had owned a Braun Oral-B Sonicare Complete which I go in 2006. Just a week ago (Feb 16, 2012) the battery had gone dead on it. I was pretty happy considering it lasted over 6 years. Granted it was a little more expensive than the 5000, I still expect this SmartSeries to perform as good if not better. When reading the manual on this toothbrush I seen the section on the battery in it. It gave instructions on what to do if and when the battery goes dead on it. I tried to perform the procedure on my old Sonicare since they have the same basic structure. I couldn\'t seem to open the bottom of it and any suggestions would be great. However, I don\'t even know if the battery on that model is even replaceable. When I first turned on the SmartSeries 5000 I noticed a BIG difference that my old Sonicare. The sound was extremely different. The Sonicare had a tight buzzing sound that sounded very well built. The 5000 had more of a loose buzz. It is a bit louder and makes me question if its going to last half the time my old toothbrush did. Who knows, maybe this is a new addition that cleans your teeth better or maybe I\'m just so used to my old one that I question anything different. The Smart Guide system on this brush is pretty cool. If you have kids, it will definitely make them want to brush. There\'s a smiley face that gets bigger and bigger the longer your brush. You can stick the Smart Guide screen onto a mirror or the wall. The toothbrush also has a monitor in it that lets you know if you\'re brushing too hard. There is a red light that is very noticeable on the handle that lights up when your pushing too hard. It is compatible with 5 different brush heads that supposedly do different things. I don\'t know if this is just a selling point or what but I find it pretty handy. Overall, there is not much difference in the 1000, 1500, 3000, or 5000. Just a couple additions the higher the number but the basic stuff is going to be there with all of them. If I had to do it over I would have gotten a cheaper one. I thought getting the biggest and best one would have more advantages. It\'s still a good buy and I have no complaints as of yet."

So when the new tubes came (I order several at a time) I figured it was just an update on the packaging and not a new formula, as the canker sore labeling was still there. Yet within a day of using the new stuff, the inside of my mouth was entirely covered in canker sores. I even got one on my lips, a first. It took a few days for all of them to go away, but this is obviously not the same toothpaste as before.If a company changes a formula on something like this, that should be made clear.

The original must have lasted at least 10 years, but the replacement doesn\'t look like it will hold up as well.  It works fine with the coffee maker though.Reusable filters seem to let more fine grounds and sediment through than a good paper filter and while they don\'t use paper they do require water to wash them so I don\'t know that they\'re really all that much better for the environment than a disposable filter.  If you understand the advantages and disadvantages and know what you\'re getting, this seems a fine reusable filter.  Be advised that if you have a Braun coffee maker you might need the Braun brand replacement filter as some off-brand replacement filters don\'t have the \'notches\' in the rim of the filter that you would need to fit some Braun coffee makers.The description of the product on the Amazon page that I ordered the filter from is wrong.

The brush cycle is more aggressive and \'feels\' like it is doing a better job, although I am a little worried it might be too strong. You can reset it to a more gentle pattern and several different head styles are available.The only way I could get the Hard brushing alert to kick in was to push very hard.The travel case came in handy right away and it the tooth brush worked for a week on the road without a charge."

I purchased they for the rest of the family and my 11 year old is doing a much better brushing.I\'ve never had any problems with this toothbrush running low on power, even when I\'m away from home (and the charger) for a few days.Original Review: (Sept 2010)I\'ve been using the Oral-B power toothbrush for a few weeks now and I\'m very pleased with it. Other electric toothbrushes did an ok job, but they usually had problems with getting gummed up with residue or lacked much in the energy department.The Oral-B power toothbrush has a brush head that\'s about 1/2\' in diameter that consists of a small rubber cup in the middle and is surrounded by bristles on the edges. I\'m able to maneuver it easily to the every tooth surface and get the some spots that I couldn\'t get to with a conventional brush. I find that I\'m able to get away with using about half of the toothpaste I did before. As a result, much less is wasted and there are no excess globs of toothpaste getting washed down the drain.One feature I really love is the inductive charging base. It doesn\'t have any exposed contacts, which means the brush is easy to rinse off after I brush. The base is easy to keep clean for the same reason.The power switch is behind a flexible rubber part of the grip and is easy to turn on and off. The brush isn\'t especially quiet when it runs, but that\'s not a big deal. It\'s not deafening either.It\'s doing a great job keeping my teeth cleaned with much less effort than a regular brush. I\'m very happy with it."

By way of full disclosure, I have been using the Oral B Cross-action toothbrush for a number of months, and in the past I used a Sonicare toothbrush.For whatever reason, I keep seeing more and more electric toothbrushes lately, each of which is supposed to be the \'latest and greatest\' design.  Frankly, I can\'t see the difference between many of them.  Maybe there are incremental changes that make them worth the sometimes excessive cost, but who knows?  And of course, manufacturers seem to be pretty generous with dental offices, which seem to either display the Oral B brand or Sonicare, or both.  But I suspect that the results between the various brands are pretty similar.This toothbrush is very similar to my Cross-action, the key differences being (i) it lacks the cross action brushes below the oscillating head, (ii) it has a 2 minute timer, and (iii) it\'s rechargable.  Frankly, I prefer the cross-action brushes, but that\'s not crically important.  I do really like the 2 minute timer, and the fact it\'s rechargable.  It does a good job cleaning, and the timer is a nice feature.From my perspective, I don\'t think that the brushes that sell for $70+ are worth the money.  Far from it.  The Cross action does a fine job on my teeth, and this brush is pretty comparable, with the added plusses of being rechargable and having the two minute timer.  So I think this is a good buy for the money, and I would recommend it.  I also like the fact that there are a variety of different heads available for it, including ones that floss, are gentle, etc.I\'d say that this brush is a very good value for the money."

The first few daysI used it, it felt like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  My teeth felt smooth and clean.  This is a awesome toothbrush, small round bristle head is better than the sonicare long shaped one, becuase you pay more attention toeach tooth and it\'s really fast and easy to use and brush.  Now I look forward to brushing everyday and I also brought one for my wife and three kids.Update:  I went to costco and they had the same tooth but a professional version, which cost more money and works the same.  My recommendation is that if you can afford it then get the professional version or if not, this one works just as fine and maybe even better since it saves you money."

The handle broke a few months ago and I switched to a regular non-electric toothbrush, waiting for a good deal on electric toothbrushes. Found the Oral-B 50% mail-in-rebate offer and bought the SmartSeries 5000 from Amazon. It was delivered yesterday. It came with the 5000 handle, wireless display, charger, 2 FlossAction brush heads and a storage unit for brush heads.I was using the same Oral-B FlossAction brushheads with the 3D Excel, and I think the real technology is in the brushheads, so I was skeptical of the value from the 5000 handle. But when I brushed with it this morning I was really surprised by how much better this handle is from the 3D Excel. I also realized why I have been using electric toothbrushes; manual toothbrushes do not even come close. It felt like I went to the dentist. Absolutely worth the $50 I paid (after mail in rebate) including shipping. I still think the wireless display (Smart Guide) is a marketing gimmick, but I may be proven wrong over the next several weeks of use.I have not used the 3000, 4000 series or the Sonicare, but I would definitely recommend this over the 3D Excel handle and definitely over manual toothbrushes."

Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price. So I asked myself, \'How bad can they be\'?The brush heads I received looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense). When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example. On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth). These brush heads have very poor motion constraint. The circular brush can easily \'slide\' around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).Not only that, but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing. As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \'knock-off\', more interested in looking like the original than acting like it.My advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads. Your mouth and your dentist will thank you."

Years ago my dentist recommended Sonicare and I have been a faithful user of them, upgrading when new models came along.  My dental visits have reflected that use.My hygienist prefers Oral-B and we have talked about it over the years.  I wasn\'t persuaded.  Recently Oral-B started a 50% off campaign and with their 60 day return policy I thought I would try them out.I am glad I did.  I very much like this toothbrush and how it works.  It is bigger than my Sonicare Flex, but even so it feels very good in my hand.  I love the smart timer.  While the Sonicare gives you a beep/jar every 30 seconds, you can see your progress with the Oral-B on the timer.  The Oral-B also gives you a jar too.  In fact, this is the one thing I don\'t like about it.  It is too much of a jar, especially at the 2 minute mark.  It is as if your car is about to stall.After two minutes the Sonicare shuts off.  The Oral-B keeps going until you shut it off.  I am finding that I keep on using it for another 30 to 60 seconds.  Now you can select a deep clean cycle of 3 minutes rather than the normal 2 minute cycle, but I find I prefer going through the normal cycle and then concentrating on the areas my dentist has mentioned as needing extra attention for another 30/60 seconds.The brushes seem to be fine.  I have used the ones that came with the package but also the sensitive head.  I like the sensitive head best.  It is a bit more compact and seems to get the job done.I will know how effective it is for me when I next visit the dentist for a cleaning.But for now, my feeling is that I am doing a better job in brushing and concentrating on the problem areas.I am keeping this and sending in for the rebate."

It holds its charge so that I can leave it off the charger for three days or so, and I still get solid power. The dual brush allows for getting at all areas in the mouth and covers a wide area when held sideways. The toothbrush is fairly lightweight, easy to use and hold. I\'m not sure it always slows down accurately on its timer to encourage the brusher to move to another tooth area, but to me that doesn\'t matter. I brush thoroughly, and this toothbrush makes thorough brushing much easier than a manual toothbrush.The price is more than inexpensive for the quality - it\'s downright super-affordable. I\'ll see how long the brush head lasts, but for now, this is worth every penny."

I clean it regularly with rubbing alcohol, soap & water, and keep it dry, as well as changing the brush heads routinely, but nothing seems to stop the odor from happening. In the short term, this seemed like a great, value priced electric toothbrush, but once that odor begins (and it could be as soon as a couple months), I would advise throwing it away because there\'s no getting rid of it. For a three month electric toothbrush, there are much better values out there."

You can not change the battery, and you can not send it in for the battery to be replaced. Go out and buy a new one is all you can do. Do you how much the battery in there is actually for.....$6-7 at the Batteries plus and $2-3 online. Yup, they want you to dump a $100+ product because they don\'t want you to replace that cheap battery in there. Refer to page 10 of your manuals.But, a lot of you have already bought this product. No worries, simply google it. There are plenty of videos. The process is pretty simple and can be accomplished with just a screw driver and the triangular tool on the charger.

At first it tingled so much touching my tongue that I had to take a break from brushing, but after a few days I got used to it. I haven\'t used electric toothbrushes before, so I can only compare the Oral-B Pulsonic to manual toothbrushes. I find that the Pulsonic leaves my teeth feeling smoother than my manual toothbrush and, apart from the tingling, it doesn\'t seem to have any negative effect on my gums.Pros:* Non-contact induction charging mechanism means there\'s no metal contacts to get dirty and prevent charging* Built-in timer to remind you to spend the recommended 30s brushing each quandrant of your teeth* The smaller of the interchangeable brush heads allows you to brush hard-to-reach areas* Teeth feel very clean and smooth after brushingCons:* Non-contact charging mechanism is less efficient than a wired connection and therefore wastes energy* Rechargeable battery is not replaceable - the entire toothbrush must be replaced when the battery wears out* It doesn\'t come with a carrying case.

It gets every speck of plaque off of my teeth, even in the hard to reach areas.

Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  I\'m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time. (You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about oral hygiene.)The toothbrush comes with a sealed plastic charger, which will charge the brush overnight.  A full charge will give you a week\'s worth of brushing. (14 x 2 minutes) This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.  You can also store the brush on the charger, but this isn\'t the most ecological way of charging the brush.  It also comes with one refill, and additional refills are available here on Amazon."

She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself.

Despite the name change from \'Triumph\' to \'SmartSeries,\' there are no differences except for the charger-toothbrush-holding-stand, which has changed from a tall rounded design (which was a pain to assemble and disassemble) to a elongated flattened rectangle.  In fact, if you look at the handle of your SmartSeries 5000, it says, \'Triumph.\'  All of these toothbrushes are the same design, except the 9400 doesn\'t interface with the SmartSeries clock.I have noticed that the price point has stayed similar over the years, and now Oral-B is consistently including the \'SmartGuide,\' which is a little clock-like contraption that gives signals (e.g., time, time of brush, too much pressure, etc.).  This toothbrush is convenient and does a pretty good job of keeping your teeth much cleaner and whiter than manual brushing.  My dentist doesn\'t scold me as much during cleanings any more.One caveat: My husband\'s Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries) had a bearing go out within six months of normal use.  The SmartSeries clock would flash the \'red triangle\' (brushing with too much pressure) caution and the toothbrush would buzz uncomfortably throughout the brushing process.  Although the toothbrush originally cost us around $149, we couldn\'t find the original sales receipt in order to claim the warranty.  Finally, after complaining about it for a year-and-a-half, we accepted the hit to the pocketbook and replaced his malfunctioning Triumph 9900 with the SmartSeries 5000... which was surprisingly the same toothbrush despite the name change.In short:- The price at MSRP is the equivalent of 30 regular toothbrushes, but it does a very good job when it works- This toothbrush is a good buy from Amazon due to significant price decrease (major retailers are still selling it at MSRP)- The SmartSeries 5000 (with SmartSeries) is the same as the Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries)- Keep your receipt for potential warranty issues! Better to be safe than sorry, and $160 poorer due to replacement cost (like us)- 10 hours to fully charge, about 10 days of charge at 2x brushings/day- Standalone charger is convenient to detach from brush-holder for extra counter room or to take on trips"

After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.-----THE GIST OF IT---------I\'m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that\'s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn\'t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It\'s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn\'t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn\'t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It\'s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.-----ENDING------Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won\'t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won\'t do it.  They\'ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.Lastly, I don\'t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes."

I thought that was way better than our manual toothbrushes, but thought I\'d give this a whirl.  It makes a HUGE difference!  For one, the head is much smaller than the SpinBrush.  It\'s just one rotating head, whereas the SpinBrush has a rotating head and another section that goes up and down.  While I thought the rotation wouldn\'t leave my mouth feeling as clean as the double-motion head of the SpinBrush, it actually felt better!  Perhaps the smaller head allows it to get to more places in my mouth, or perhaps it is that the rotation looks, sounds, and feels much faster.  The SpinBrush is battery powered and even with new batteries, I don\'t think the top head spun as fast as this bad boy.  While this toothbrush costs more than the SprinBrush, it\'s still relatively inexpensive and since you can replace the heads, it\'s still a good option for those who don\'t want to spend top dollar on an electric toothbrush.

It comes with an additional brush head, and there are five different brush heads which can be purchased.  They are described in the instructions, and there is a $3 coupon included inside the box.After approximately two and one-half minutes, the brush slows down and gives a couple of sluggish spurts, which signals time to stop brushing. It doesn\'t stop by itself and has to be turned off. It is compact and fits well in smaller hands.  I wasn\'t expecting too much from this little toothbrush but was very surprised at its vigorous action.  My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after use.  I can\'t determine how long the battery will last, as I\'ve used it only for a couple of weeks.

It\'s slim and easy to hold and the brush head is the right size, fits in my mouth nicely, and I like the way it cleans.  I also like the little Precision brush that comes with it.

The top part of the brush goes in circles and the lower part of the brush goes up and down and really gets in there-- and without irritating!The timer is great also! Sometimes I feel like I am rushing when I brush my teeth, but with the built in 2 minute timer, I know that I am not exactly rushing through and well, its doing a great job in those 2 minutes.I am not finding any left over food when I floss afterwards either which really shows that this toothbrush is doing its job.Also, since this is rechargeable, I dont have to worry about constantly changing the battery- so that saves time and money!!There is an extra toothbrush head that I decided to use one and my husband the other one.

Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week\'s time, in my case of twice daily use. While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful! Not only is this toothbrush built for home use, it\'s the one you won\'t want to be without wherever you go.I especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I\'m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds. The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who\'ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have... yet I found I can get used to the sonic sensations, and I even feel that my gums and teeth are gaining strength, cleanliness and overall health. Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.So just how compact is this toothbrush? At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one\'s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing. The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth. The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.The directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I\'ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do). Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question. This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush I don\'t want to live without!  Highly, highly recommended."

But after adjusting to the weird feel of something electrical in contact with the moisture in your mouth, and the buzzing vibrating sensations on your teeth, it didn\'t take too long to get the hang of it.You still need to do some serious flossing, and ?I think this device might even be pushing some food particles into those post-molar crevices, so don\'t forget to use the Interdental brush and floss in there too.So far, it seems like an easy modern way to ensure basic dental hygiene, and I\'m satisfied with the results.

(this is the second I have and happen to have the exact same problem). This did not happen on the previous model.

So when I first turned it on, I was afraid as it sounds like a dentist\'s drill!  However, I soon adjusted and am now quite the fan.  It comes with a two minute timer which sort of stutters when the time is up.  And with this gadget those two minutes I have found simply fly by.  What I most like, though, is that this toothbrush really does seem to get in deep between all the nooks and crannies and cleanse my teeth very well.  I also like that I\'m able to reach back and even brush my wisdom teeth and get them clean.  Something I couldn\'t do with a manual toothbrush.  Since this is my first electric toothbrush I had to learn to adjust also to the fact that I don\'t have to press down hard and push like with a manual toothbrush.  This one really does the work for you.  And I have found it best to let it linger some on each tooth.  And the results are that my teeth really do look and feel clean.  I\'m quite pleased with this gadget and I do very much recommend it.  It comes with a replacement toothbrush head as well, however, you have to figure out a way to store it on your own.  As it doesn\'t come enclosed in any type of case or anything like that.  I currently have mine wrapped in a paper towel.  Overall, though, I am most pleased and happy with this toothbrush.P.S.  After using this product for more weeks I\'ve discovered fine lines creeping in on the edges of my lips.  I noticed that with this toothbrush the toothpaste seems to gather there and I think the toothpaste was burning my skin.  I have very sensitive skin.

It does the same job as the more expensive version and is easier to hold. It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it. Because it is lighter and thinner, I think I actually use it longer. It is also easier to find the replacement heads for it. I also think that the shape of the toothbrush makes it is easier to get at the back of the bottom teeth where the plaque is the worst. That means less time in the hygenist chair.

Like Sonicare, this model is using the \'proximity\' charge method where you place the toothbrush\'s body on the base and charging takes place when the base is plugged into an electric outlet.- Extra brush - this model comes with 2 brushes, one mounted on the body and one extra.- Easy brush replacement - you simply pull the mounted brush to take it out, push the new one in.- $3 coupon to be used when purchasing replacement brush heads.Not so good or annoying:- The packaging is atrocious. It comes in one of those bullet-proof clear plastic enclosures that you must cut with scissors and make sure you don\'t cut yourself in the sharp edges while at it. It took me several minutes to extract the contents off packaging and I did manage to do it scratch-free.- Vibrations are a little too strong - this MIGHT be my Sonicare bias (which I\'ve been using for longer than I can remember) but I felt that this VITALITY was a little too aggressive. My teeth are a little bit sensitive and they didn\'t like that.- A little too noisy for what I am used to - of course, an \'ultrasonic\' toothbrush noise is harder to detect because... it\'s ultrasound.When compared to the higher-end products, it may be worth noting that the VITALITY does not come with a \'full\' timer. The toothbrush does tell you when the 2 minutes are up (noise similar to revving an engine) but it does not turn itself off and, more importantly, it does not give you 30-second signals so you can switch \'quadrants\' as the higher end products do.The VITALITY offers a lot for the price but I am not sure that \'price\' is THAT meaningful when the topic is our teeth. It\'s probably preferable to most manual toothbrushes but, for a few dollars more you can get a lot better. Overall this is a decent product but if I had to replace my higher end toothbrush today, knowing what I know after trying out this product I would NOT go for the VITALITY and sacrifice features and convenience. The few dollars saved would not justify it.Three stars, meaning \'It\'s Okay\' seem to be the fair rating on the Amazon scale."

Amazon\'s description for this product says that it comes with three brush heads: \'Pro White(tm) Brush Head with polishing cup: Whitens teeth by removing surface stains,  Oral-B FlossAction� Brush Head: Offers outstanding interdental cleaning, and Oral-B Sensitive Brush Head: Is gentle on teeth and gums.\'  There are only two brush heads in the package.  No big deal, right?  Well, then, why not get the description right?  I am disturbed by false advertising, even at the level of how many brush heads are included; makes me wonder what else is wrong in the description.2. The door to the battery compartment on the SmartSense unit is very hard to remove.  It slides about an eighth of an inch and then you have to pick it off.  That is very unclear and the manual does not give directions on how to remove it without breaking it.  If you have any problems with your fingers, you may not be able to get it open since it requires a lot of force to move the back that one eighth of an inch.  That is a problem, especially since the SmartSense unit is one of the reasons this unit is so expensive.  I went to the Oral-B website to find a solution for this problem and there was none.  The website is purely a marketing site.This product is advertised with great features, and others have given it good reviews.  It had better be great or this is one customer who will take advantage of the 60-day money back guarantee."

A crest representative came to my office, presented information that made sense and had literature that this brush was the only toothbrush to show increased efficacy in independent testing.  Anyway I bought several for my parents and myself and have been impressed.What I like:-Makes your teeth \'feel\' noticeably cleaner, like they feel when they\'ve just been cleaned at the dental office-Wireless display motivates me to brush longer than I normally would, I\'ll be honest I don\'t know where they got the recommended 2 minute timeframe, but I do it to see the smiley face on the indicator-Wireless display has PRESSURE INDICATOR; I diagnose wear on teeth at the gum line multiple times everyday.  If this is an issue for you get this brush.  It\'ll save you money at the dentist and stop you from harming your teeth-Well made, handle is thin and ergonomic, charger has a small footprint on the counter, no electrical components exposed and everything feels sturdy-Wide selection of brush heads that are reasonably priced ($40 for a 2 year supply at Costco).  Two heads stand out to me.  The first is the funky looking one, which actually provides a floss like action between teeth.  NOT a substitute for flossing but I have noticed considerably less debris removed when I do floss after using this brush.  Also there is an orthodontic (braces) brush that gets in-between the teeth and the braces.  If you are plunking down the thousands for your child to have braces get this brush / attachment, otherwise when the braces a removed there is a good chance the teeth will have unsightly white halos around where the brackets were which is actually decalcification which is the start of cavities.Overall I\'m very impressed with this brush so it is most defiantly \'dentist recommended\' by myself.  My parents absolutely love it."

Then we went back to manual toothbrushes for a while.  We realized that the manual toothbrushes didn\'t leave our mouths feeling as clean as the rechargeable toothbrushes, so we decided to purchase a Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.We purchased the Sonicare from Amazon and tried it for a couple weeks.  At first, we thought it did a very good job cleaning our teeth and gums, but it started feeling weak.  I\'m not sure if the toothbrush lost its full power after the first week, but the pulsating just didn\'t seem as good as our older Oral B.We returned it to Amazon as it seemed defective, and purchased the Oral B Professional Series 5000.  We\'ve used it for a few days now and it draws rings around the Sonicare.  The oscillating motion of the toothbrush alone leaves our teeth, gums, and overall mouth feeling much cleaner than anything we\'ve ever used; feels almost as good as a cleaning from the dentist.I highly recommend this toothbrush over the Sonicare.  Also, we are using the Oral B Floss brush heads.  They are tremendous and are much cheaper than the Sonicare brush heads as well."
2633,2697,20120328,B003UKKHB4,4,"March 28, 2012",AT1A4VABGBB2H,Oral-B and Periodontal Disease!,"Hello All,I figured I would finally rate the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush now. I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this product.First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910. This electric toothbrush was great. I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare. My only gripe was the replacements are a bit on the pricy side. Moving on, I decided to replace the Sonicare (gave to my wife) with the Oral-B 3000. My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line. Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.As an owner of both, I find them similar in a sense, that they are both out (the toothbrushes of course) to perform the same job. The Sonicare did its job just fine. However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch. Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it\'s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.Onto the Oral-B. This brush has performed great. The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease) so I don\'t bleed as much. The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare and I really see no difference other than the size of the head. Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean). I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip. Although, it\'s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work. Plus, I always rinse the brush afterwards with hot water.The battery life appears to be great. I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days. The vibration and strength is great the company claims (40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute). The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \'off\'.The toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation. The build quality seems good to me. I have dropped this toothbrush three times over the span of three months and the electric toothbrush survived without any visual damage or cracks.The charging does take quite some time until it is fully charged. However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night. Therefore, the brush has hours of charging before its next use. One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG. This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first. Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit. Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don\'t even really notice it.In closing, I like this toothbrush. I gave it four stars because while I think it\'s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let\'s face it, it\'s a toothbrush right? Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road). Both the Oral-B and the Sonicare, have their difference. But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease. I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I do.And remember, I do NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can\'t go wrong either way."

Unfortunately, it disappointed on all possible counts.  The floss itself is very flimsy and breaks easily.  When it does not break it pulls loose from the pick/holder itself.  I can usually floss/pick my mouth with a single generic pick.  With the Oral B Glide/Scope pick, I need three or four.  Sometimes I can only floss one or two teeth before the floss breaks or pulls out.  Never again!"

Feels like an actual toothbrush.Second, I like the charging stand--you can mount it on the wall and it holds the toothbrush snugly.Third, I can get my teeth just as clean with this $50 product as I could with the $200 Sonicare.I\'m very satisfied with it."

No toothbrush head except for this one can really get deep down in there. I credit it with keeping the gum healthy at the surgery site and possibly saving my tooth. For about a year now this illusive item disappeared from the store shelves and I was not even able to find it on Amazon. Without it that area just could not stay as healthy.

The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you\'ve cleaned.But... It\'s the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest\'s claims of being \'shred resistant\' fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven\'t yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can\'t even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn\'t inspire confidence. At the price premium Crest is demanding, I\'d expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece."

The winner for me is Oral B Essentials. Very smooth - perfectly thin. Gets between the teeth with no trouble at all. Quick to do the whole mouth. Never cuts my gums. The floss can shred a little bit, but no worse than any other I\'ve tried, I won\'t bother deducting points for that.

My husband gets annoyed that the toothbrush does not automatically shut off like his does but I think I prefer it this way because I often spend more than 2 minutes on my teeth. I also like how small the head is; I can reach places on my back teeth that were inaccessible before.The pressure sensor never worked on my model, which is a shame because I do believe I brush hard. Just to test it out, I bore down so hard on the brush that the motor bogged down but still the sensor did not come on which led me to believe it\'s a malfunction. Hopefully I am in the minority.

There is one quirk that happens while using it that is a little annoying. It turns off and on radpidly about every 45 seconds. It happens so quickly that it doesn\'t disput brushing. Just annoying. It has a feature of three speeds which is very nice. when first turned on it is a regular speed, when the button is pressed again it goes to a slower speed designed for sensitive, when the button is pressed the third time it is a combination of regular and slow speed alternating radidly between the two. That is desined for more plaque removal. The problem is you have to go throuogh all three speeds to shut it off each use. Othe tan that it\'s a great brush. I\'d buy it again. R.L.B."

This one is about half the size of the previous generation, and equally powerful.I did own a Philips Sonic Tooth Brush about 8 years ago, but it only lasted two years before it broke.This one never seems to require a charge, after about two weeks of use I put it back on the charger out of habit.Before ordering, I figured I would give the Arm & Hammer Sonic Spin Brush a try (available at my local pharmacy for approx. $30).  The difference can be compared to a Pinto vs. a Lexus.  The Sonic Spin Brush worked okay, and probably if I had never owned a real Sonic Toothbrush, I would have kept it, but it was not the same.

My dentist sold me a toothbrush with two of these heads for 25 dollars, and now I know why. The plastic paddles in this head\'s bristles are like a jackhammer on your teeth and gums. I have used this brush for a week, and have had gums bleeding and swelling (NEVER any problems before, and yes, I floss daily), teeth getting more sensitive and less clean feeling afterward (they can feel quite clean, but you have to brush twice the recommended time, which is detrimental to enamel and gums), and this head makes a huge mess!

Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don\'t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don\'t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don\'t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.  I\'ll figure it out."

Additionally I find their recharge mechanism ingenious, there are no connectors, near as I can tell, it must use a magetic field. What I mean is that the recharge station and linking area on the brush are all both entirely covered in plastic, so there are no \'vulnerable\' spots for bathroom water to reach to short things out or gum up the works.I also find that I take longer brushing my teeth when I use an electric brush, I\'m not sure why I do so, I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.There is one major design flaw though. The moving bristle head has too much clearance between it and the rest of the brush, because it regularly, at least once a day, pinches the inside of my lips or cheeks, often to the point of breaking the skin, and at least once a week bad enough to make my spit turn completely red.It could be that my brush head is defective, I don\'t know, but it definitely happens, and it never happened with any of my previous electric toothbrushes."

I know most people don\'t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn\'t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!Ok now for the research details:1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it\'s time to brush on another side.6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you9. It\'s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn\'t like to brush or doesn\'t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. It guides you so you know you are getting a great cleaning. Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it! So as you can tell I love it and I am very satisfied with my purchase! Good luck and hope it works amazing for you as it does for me and my family!"

I noticed immediately when I used it that it seemed to get my teeth cleaner than the sonicare as evidenced by little bits of grime the sonicare had never been able to get, this thing grasped with ease and afterwards my teeth felt a good deal cleaner as well.

It was a loud and eventually became sloppy in holding the spindle from turning around requiring the handle to constantly be rotated. It still was very effective and still holds it\'s charge without fail.Long story short, I did research and ended up choosing the professional care 5000 over the 4000 as a replacement.  The sticker shock held off the purchase until I found a 50% rebate and free priority prime shipping.  I really prefer the \'polishing\' heads and bought 6 extra.  Net cost was about $55 which is about + price of the additional brush heads.There is no comparison between this and our old model.  It is quiet and has some cool features.  There is a visible battery (fuel) gage on the handle, and a transmitter to communicate with a seperate remote unit.  This thing times you, is a clock, and even blinks if you brush too hard. The travel case is well constructed and useful. Buy one...rebate took about 2 weeks...mine was a $55 check.PROS:  quiet- cool features- teeth feel like you just had a cleaning...squeek and all- noticed definate whitening almost immediately- find myself brushing more often by choice, angled position allows makes getting to back teeth a non-issue. We love it and highly recommend it.Check out the polishing heads which have a yellow rubber center. It saves the outer bristles and you still get more than adequate flossing and unbelievable plaque removal. It really extends head life especially if you brush hard, like my wife. Trust me on this; I smoke cigars.NEGATIVES:  Really none..somewhat pricey heads, but more gental than even soft hand brushes."

Very happy!","First of all, a comment on the price...This is an amazing price for the Oral-B 5000. I just saw them yesterday (Jan. 15, 2011) at my local Target store for 159.00 with no rebate offers. So, getting one here through Amazon for under a hundred is a great buy! Not only was 96.00 a great price, but mine also came with a 50% mail-in rebate offer, which was a nice surprise. So, after that I will have only paid 48 bucks! Awesome! My girlfriend also got the rebate with hers. I don\'t know how long the rebates will last, but even without the rebate, this is an excellent price, and well worth every penny!After reading all the reviews here, and talking to my dentist about it and hearing his recommendation, my girlfriend took the plunge and ordered one a couple weeks ago. As soon as she tried it, she fell in love with it. She told me how good it felt on her teeth, and how clean her mouth felt after using it, and how she really looked forward to brushing. I immediately ordered mine the same day.My first impressions on the build quality...After opening and unpacking mine, I was immediately impressed with the build quality of the unit. The brush handle is solid and seems very well constructed, and the head that holds the brushes seems strong. I fully expect this to last a long time, and hold up really well. It\'s also attractive to look at, and the batteries last a long time on a full charge.This model comes with a separate wireless display unit, that displays brushing information while you\'re using it, and functions as a clock when you\'re not brushing. It displays a timer that will countdown from 2:00 minutes, or count up depending on your preference. It also shows the quadrants of your teeth for a visual reminder to make sure you get all areas. It displays which brushing mode you\'re using, and will flash a warning if you press too hard.Is the display really necessary? Perhaps not... The brush unit will vibrate each 30 or 45 seconds to remind you to change to the next quadrant. And it will stutter when the time is up to let you know you\'ve completed the recommended time. But, it is nice to have those visual cues where you can see them easily, and it is nice to have a small bathroom clock handy. So, I really like the display unit a lot. I think it was a nice addition, and I think most people will appreciate it.My impressions on actually using the brush...I\'ve had mine only a week so far, but I love it completely! I honestly think this is one of the best investments in my health I\'ve ever made. I\'ve never taken care of my teeth like I should have, and I have several fillings to show for it. I\'ve always tried to brush at least twice a day, but they were always short, quick brushes, by hand, and not very thorough. And I never thought I would be excited about brushing, until now.Now, I love brushing. I look forward to it. I brush at least three times a day, and never less than two minutes each time. I love how long the battery lasts, so I can take it with me to work, or on trips. This brush really makes it easy to stay on top of brushing. I can feel how thoroughly each tooth is getting cleaned, and it feels good on my teeth and gums. I haven\'t experienced any discomfort using mine.After brushing, my teeth are literally squeeky clean. It really does feel like a professional cleaning. It\'s only been a week with mine, but I can already notice a difference in their appearance. I\'m excited to see how they will look after a couple months.One last thing I really like is the carrying case that comes with it. It holds the brush firmly in place, and two brush heads firmly in place. Very convenient for carrying with me.This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I can\'t even imagine going back to a manual brush. I highly recommend this, and I\'m sure you will enjoy it just as much.Hope that helps..."

423,431,20050817,B0000C4KJV,4,"August 17, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one\'s teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.2.  Waxed floss is \'waxed\' to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don\'t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: \'If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away\'.I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.Jim \'Konedog\' Koenig, DDS"

2174,2224,20110211,B002HWS9GG,5,"February 11, 2011",A1JUGQ8IQRW5MA,Serious Fun for Your Mouth!,"Recently my old Braun/Oral B (about 6 years old) began to \'catch\' with every little maneuver, so I figured the motor was wearing out and decided to see what the latest technology had to offer. This brush is simply light-years beyond the old Oral B 3D! It seems more powerful and even more effective (another plus: this model can use the same brushes [Oral B Precision Clean] as my older model, so leftovers won\'t go to waste. This model also accepts other more specialized Oral B brushes).Many thanks to B. Johnson for pointing out the value of the SmartGuide. For me as well, it serves as a neat little bathroom clock. But the most surprising thing is that by breaking down the recommended two-minute brushing cycle into four groups of 30 seconds each (via a simple but effective circular visual cue), the SmartGuide makes the entire process seem to go by faster. (With old-style brushes, the usual two minutes of unstructured brushing casts you upon a veritable ocean of time. I was always surprised by how long it took for the brush to stutter its two-minute signal. Oftentimes, I just stopped when I felt like it!) You always know (1) exactly where you are in the cycle and (2) when to move on to the next quadrant. This unwittingly clever bit of psychology gives you a sense of making clearly defined progress and ensures that you\'re devoting equal time to all sectors of your mouth. I brush for the full two minutes now, with no sense of impatience. In fact, the experience is so pleasant that I almost always do a final general sweep for another 30 seconds or so.One more interesting detail: perhaps because of its higher speed, this brush seems to prevent water and toothpaste from dripping along the brush shaft. I used to have to put my chin up to minimize this minor annoyance with the old Braun. But after several weeks of using the 5000 (with chin still up but not so extremely), I\'ve not had a single drip.I\'ve always been a faithful tooth-brusher, but ever since I got my first electric brush, brushing has been so much fun that I look forward to it. This terrific toothbrush takes the experience to a whole new level. And most important of all, it cleans and stimulates better than anything else I\'ve ever used."

I liked the slim design and two speed options.  The brush head looked more like a traditional manual toothbrush.  It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can\'t say that they appear whiter.  I find that the 30 second timer and two minute marker to be both helpful yet a bit annoying- its nice to know how long you\'ve been working on a section of teeth but I tend to brush longer than the recommended 2 minutes so it isn\'t broken up to my needs.Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  The Pulsonic seems a bit flimsy- like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  I also don\'t feel like the bristles get in between my teeth like the Sonicare did, either.  The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn\'t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.  I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!"

Once it goes in your mouth the floss breaks the moment it touches any teeth.  I\'m not sure how Oral B can put their name to this piece of junk. The worst part, the floss often tares apart in shreds (when it doesn\'t break entirely), leaving threads of this stuff stuck in between your teeth.  So, you have to use ANOTHER one to get the first one out. Often times you end up shredding that one in the same spot and need to try again using just enough pressure to make it between the teeth, but not too much that it leaves another thread stuck there.  Very frustrating.Plackers are the ONLY ones I\'ve ever used that simply DO NOT BREAK.

I have written Amazon reviews for Oral-B products dating back to 2002. I have had very few dental issues in this time although, in fairness, I must also report that I began daily flossing during this time as well, and that may be just as important.This new model is a definite step up from the ancient \'Plak Control Plus\' model that I had been using. It\'s full name is \'Professional Care 3000\' and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument. The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one. Please note that this is not an ultrasonic toothbrush. Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action. The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth very quickly.The 3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button. The first is \'Daily Clean\' which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis. The second is \'Sensitive\' which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth. The third is \'Whitening\' which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \'Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\'The instructions that come with the 3000 recommend that you brush for 2 minutes - no less and no more. To assist you with this, once you turn the brush on it will pulse twice every 30 seconds. If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you\'ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times. To turn the brush off from any mode, just press and hold the on/off button.Built into the 3000 is a \'Hard Brushing Alert\' which is an LED on the handle that lights up if you are pressing too hard. Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth. Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly. The instructions say that the LED is, \'Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\' so apparently there\'s a dental health issue here as well. The brush is very powerful, so it\'s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.The brush comes with a charging stand and covered storage tray that can accommodate 4 brush heads. The storage tray is dishwasher-safe, the charging stand is not."

It thoroughly cleans teeth and gums and the areas I was always unable to reach with any other toothbrush in the past. A little costly most would think for toothbrush but believe me it\'s worth every cent"

In any event be aware of the style that is being sold and know that the original type was a more firm bristle, and more effective."

I have used at least 40/50 of these over the years. That has happened twice to me. But it\'s fairly easy to open it (you need to pry it open with something sharp enough) and get the floss out. Again, an irritant if and when it happens, but fairly rare event for me to not worry about it."

Has a handy timer/wall clock unit to tell you when you\'ve reached the two minute recommended brushing time, but I always exceed that since I like a good scrubbing on the choppers.No issues at all so far with the unit.  The real test will be when I return to my dentist (who had in fact recommended this unit) and see if the cleaning is shorter or if they notice any difference.I\'ll update after that happens.Overall, I\'m completely pleased and think that it\'s probably a good investment.

2416,2472,20100603,B002HWS9GG,3,"June 3, 2010",A1T50IO1EMVNFH,From Sonicare to OralB,"I have been a Sonicare user for the previous 15 years. As a dentaphobe, I will always be grateful to Sonicare for keeping my mouth cavity free for my 7 year hiatus from the dentist- though to be fair, I also drank mostly water (vs. sugared drinks) and made sure to brush and floss twice daily, chewing sugarless gum throughout the day. Still, I found the Oral B a very nice upgrade for several reasons:1. NO ICKYNESS IN THE BRUSH HEAD!!! Sonicare brushes are notorious for getting all this disgusting gunk stuck up inside the brush head, leaving me with a sense of wonder about what exactly I was putting in my mouth, even after rinsing the head thoroughly in alcohol.2. Smaller brush heads. I finally feel like I am cleaning my wisdom teeth, which stick back almost to the uvula.3. Circular brush heads. Dentists always say to brush in circular motions, yet typical Sonicare brushes only go side to side.4. Using the floss-action head truly leaves less behind when I floss right after brushing.5. Another reviewer mentioned the fact Sonicare does not offer either soft bristled brushes or a sensitive mode.There were a couple downsides:1. Noise. The Oral B seems much louder, likely because the brush is moving in a circle vs. just side to side.2. Vibration Speed. One of Sonicare\'s main tenants for their brushes is that the sonic action itself gets rid of plaque/germs. The Oral B does not seem to vibrate quite as much- though flossing seems to yield fewer hangers-on, and does not just compact any recently-eaten food- such as cracker mush.There are other benefits, which Sonicare has also added to its latest greatest brushes, such as timers and better chargers. Still, I am happy with the switch- I\'ll just see if my dentist notices =)UPDATE; 2011- Going back to Sonicare.I had the brush about a year when the battery started dying ALL the time- would go from 3 of 4 bars to 0 bars in the middle of brushing. If you prefer leaving your brush plugged in all the time, this may not be a problem- but I like my batteries to hold some charge.Also, in the end, I do not feel like the brush is cleaning between the teeth as much as a Sonicare. Likely thanks to all the complainers like myself, I\'ve been exploring Amazon and noticing Sonicare has now created smaller brush heads with only the prong attachment/gotten rid of the ick factor of their bigger brush heads, and made the brushes overall less expensive (under $80).In the midst of the year\'s use, I sucked it up and returned to the dentist... to find I had 7 cavities =( While I obviously can\'t entirely blame the Oral B for this result, I again cite that the brush did not seem to clean as well between teeth/I miss the sonic action of the Sonicare- and did leave any late night cracker/chip remnants pushed down on my back teeth. So look for a new review of the latest Sonicare brush soon!"

It\'s a great product for the money, and I wish I got one years ago.  I never really knew too much about power toothbrushes until a relative suggested the Oral B.  I looked online, read a few reviews, and pretty much determined that this was the best one.  People love it.  And now I agree!  I do have to say that the wireless \'Smart Guide\' thing seems like it\'s not really necessary. It times you 30 seconds for each quadrant of your mouth, for a total of two minutes (maybe it would be good for a child??).  But, it\'s also a clock, and makes a good little clock for the bathroom!  So, regardless of the \'Smart Guide\' thing, the toothbrush itself is a must-have item!"

I brush too hard. There is a light on the back of the toothbrush (so you can see it in a mirror) that comes on when you apply too much pressure. The next thing I discovered was how clean my teeth felt! The Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing plaque between teeth (better than a sonic brush).

I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  I brush twice a day, on and off with Seonsodyne Whitenting and Sensodyne Pronamel. I also ensured that I used the \'Whitening\' brush setting that the toothbrush offers. Between the two photos, I noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not very much.  My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  So I\'d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  It would probably be nice to have it your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don\'t expect too much.  It might be somewhat of a gimmick that it \'whitens\' teeth, but if you look at what the item is called--Pro White, it is designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth and make them a little whiter.  SO in all fairness, I\'d say that it works as it should without huge results that people may expect of it."

I have not always had good brushing/flossing habits but this toothbrush makes me want to brush. It leaves my teeth feeling polished every day just like after leaving the dentist\'s office. At night I set it on the 3 minute deep clean setting which then makes me want to follow up with flossing to get maximum clean! I\'m sure I have never spent 3 minutes brushing my teeth prior to having the wireless timer that comes in the box. The handle feels very substantial in my hand, runs very smoothly, and holds its charge for several days. I previously had the cheaply made $30 Oral-B unit and I disliked using it so much that I\'m sure I hurried to finish and did not clean my teeth very well. It vibrated too much and the brush head was way too small. The SmartSeries 5000 is a joy to use.

I am obsessed with using it, for the FULL two minutes because of the just-been-to-the-dentist feel. I opted for the 55000 for the \'gimmicky\' timer which I absolutely love. When I travel I leave the timer at home and I always forget how long I\'ve been brushing. Is that vibrate the 2nd...or 3rd one? I can never remember because I usually try to do something else as I\'m brushing my teeth. So, for me, I love the timer.I love the feel of the 5000 over the 4000 (I bought my mom the 4000 for Christmas and she bought my Dad the same one).I always use the Floss Action head, it\'s by far my favorite.I was hoping this toothbrush would be a little quieter than it is but it\'s not outrageously loud. We have a master en-suite and with the bathroom door closed all the way and the rest of the house silent you can hear the toothbrush in the bedroom but it\'s not loud enough to wake my husband or myself up.I do share the handle of this toothbrush with my husband. Like some other reviewers have mentioned our battery life is not so great anymore. We can \'justbarely\' make it a week without having to recharge. It takes about 8-9 hours to charge fully.My biggest complaint is that within the last few weeks the red light on the timer (pressure sensing light) is almost continually on when we are using the toothbrush. I do need to find the manual and see if there\'s a way for us to calibrate or reset something. The toothbrush is still operating fine but I\'m afraid this issue is a sign of an impending serious malfunction."

I thought it was okay, until I tried this one. This is a fabulous brush.Pros:1. Rechargeable battery. Not likely to lose juice any time soon-just make sure you charge it for 12 hours before use.2. Small handle. It\'s not much bigger around than a regular toothbrush, especially when compared to the monster I\'ve been using. The charger is compact, too, and doesn\'t take up much room on my counter.3. Compact head. Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.4. Soft bristles.5. Vibrates rather than spinning. The spinning kind really chewed up my gums. This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations. Went away as soon as the brush was off.6. Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth. I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore. I don\'t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.7. Stops briefly to let you know when it\'s time to switch \'quadrants.\' (You\'re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.) When the maximum 2 minutes has elapsed, the brush gives a double signal.8. There is a precision attachment to get between teeth and into dental work.9. Does a fantastic job. My teeth are very clean.Cons:A bit louder than I expected, but certainly better than the SpinBrush, and the vibrating tickled my jaw. Hardly worth mentioning, though.I am incredibly pleased with this product. I would definitely buy this again and will recommend it to all my family members."

The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage. Obviously Oral-B is trying to cut corners here by offering a newer model with inferior quality.If you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine.

And then, there is the rare product that comes along which goes beyoyond the hype and acclaim. And which exceeds all expectations. Allow me to introduce to you the latter, the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush. I will not take up too much time by reiterating all the 5-star reviews. But do read these reviews; because they are right on the money. One review in particular claimed how using this product cured his bad breath problem. This claim really got my attention. I too suffered from bad breath. And no amount of brushing or tongue scraping would solve the problem of bad breath. So this claim along with many of the other positive reviews persuaded me to give the Oral-B a try. Results...Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Upon initial use it felt like I had been to the dentist office for a dental cleaning (and like so every time after use). And yes...no more bad breath...simply amazing!  Is the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush worth the price? Consider the convenience of getting a truly professional dental cleaning (at home) without having to go to a Dental Hygienist. Also, consider the cost involved of going to a dental hygienist for cleaning every six months or so. The Oral-B is worth the price many many many times over.  Note: If you have not had cleaning for a while (or not good cleaning), you may experience slight bleeding of the gums for a couple of weeks of use. As the toothbrush rids your dentals of the old and new trapped food particles (which will turn to plaque via bacteria if not cleaned of), you will experience bleeding less and less until no more. Be advised, the sticker that attaches the timer/clock to a surface, like a wall, is of industrial strength. When it sticks it stays sticked. You may pull away some of your wall, or other used surface, if you try to remove it after sticking it on. Like me, you may choose not to use sticker and just place timer/clock on sink counter-top (or a stand for eye level). However, I now use the timer/clock as a bathroom clock mostly. Because the the Oral-B toothbrush device also has a built-in timer guide. The quadrant cleaning method illustrated in the user manual seemed a bit tedious for me. I have developed a more desirable method for myself. This procedure is as follows: starting from the top chop going left outer...moving to back then going inner around to other side until at that back then around that outer side to where I started (spending a second or two on each tooth). And likewise with my bottom chop. Time-wise, the whole procedure takes around two minutes or so. You can follow the user manual guide or develop your own strategy. The main thing is to make sure that you reach all tooth and gum areas (top and bottom chops; inner and outer surfaces, and top of dentals).  Now then! How quickly should you get the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush? Don\'t walk. Don\'t skip or hop! Don\'t even run!! But warp-speed!!! And seek a desirable  merchant to acquire this dental magician."

It is an impressively sturdy unit, especially for the price.  It changes quickly, and holds its charge for a good long time.  The toothbrush head is larger than the one I had been using, but that is fine.  My dentist has always recommended a toothbrush like this, because you can work the gumline effectively in hard-to-reach places like the upper-back molars (which has historically been my brushing achillies heel.Anyhow, the only thing I don\'t like about this brush, and it\'s enough to make me consider using a different brush, is that they inserted these hard pieces of plastic in with the soft hairs, and it kind of rasps on your gums.

If you don\'t want to read it all, I give you this quick summary. Great product, well worth the price at amazon. Best clean you can get and has many useful features. I have never had healthier teeth and gums. Read further for more details.This product is simply outstanding and in a class of it\'s own.I had a situation in which my gums are not in their peak condition, and that is putting it lightly. I have had this toothbrush for just a touch over two weeks. I also drink coffee every day, only 1 cup though. Since I have been using this, my gums are already noticeably healthier, my teeth are whiter, and I find it easier to make sure I brush at least twice a day. I think this is mostly because of how much I invested into this product. At this point I have nothing but good things to say about this toothbrush.I also have my wisdom teeth fully grown in and this toothbrush is small enough where I am able to reach them and give them a proper cleaning. My wife is also using it with a separate brush head.The device takes a full 10 hours on initial charge before use, as seems to be normal for most NiMh batteries. At first the backing on the timer is a bit confusing and difficult to get off as the instructions do not help. Once you figure it out though, It is quite easy to master.Positive feedback:Now onto a more descriptive part about the features this offers. Since my gums are sensitive to begin with I can only use the normal clean and sensitive options until my gums are healthier. The other modes are a really nice feature that I plan to use when I can.The included 2 sided tape is nice for when you want to mount it to the wall.I really like how both the toothbrush and the timer give you an indication of when to switch quadrants in your mouth every thirty seconds. The timer will blink and display that you should be working on the next quadrant. The toothbrush pulses every 30 seconds and pulses 3 times every 2 minutes. (I personally don\'t think 30seconds is enough for each quadrant so I often spend more time after brushing to give my whole mouth a quick once over.)Once you get the timer set and mounted it does make a nice restroom clock as other have said. After charging and setting the timer, the toothbrush is easy effective and gives the best clean I have experienced sans a dental visit.Also a side note, I asked my dental hygienist which toothbrush they recommend for electrical as they said I should get one. This one came at the very top of their recommendations. Before this I was using Oral-B\'s cheap $20 electrical toothbrush. The difference is astounding.The container for the extra toothbrush heads is very nice allows you to let the head dry out while not connected to the handle. They brush heads are very easy to remove and clean. The different color rings are very helpful if you have more then 1 person using the same style brush head.The travel pack is a really nice and touch and is compact too.Best clean you can get without visiting a dental hygienist.Negative Feedback:The back plate on the timer is a bit unwieldy at first.The toothbrush is a bit loud but not as loud as the $20 dollar variants.IT would have been nice if the battery came pre-charged. It would also have been nice if the timer also came with a rechargeable battery solution.It is expensive and costs way too much at a standard retail store($150).It only comes with 2 brush heads."

I couldn\'t afford to spend a million dollars on some of the other electric brushes with the *fancy* features. I think this is just as good. My teeth are whiter and my breath is fresher (too much info, I know). But it\'s true. I love the 2 minute timer as well.

The bristles initially felt too hard, but it\'s just a matter of getting accustomed to the toothbrush.Although this toothbrush cleans the teeth well I cannot emphasize enough the importance of continuing to floss between the teeth.  The timer that comes with the device is not necesssary as there is a slight change in speed after each 30 seconds of brushing, but I do find it helpful for me.I keep my brush on the charger, but find it works fine without the charger when I\'m out of town over a week. If you keep it plugged in make sure the brush is seated properly or it will overheat. When used in conjunction with the Oral Breeze Quick Breeze (faucet attachment) it makes for a really clean-feeling mouth.

NOTE: the annoying part about the smartguide is taking off that darn battery cover! other reviewers weren\'t exaggerating about that at all! the clock on mine is still an hr behind since i couldn\'t remove that stupid battery cover to adjust the time.i\'ve only used two brush heads so far, whitening and floss-action. i\'m not sure if the whitening head really whitens like a whitening strip, but at least mine aren\'t staining even without using whitening toothpaste. the floss-action one doesn\'t really \'floss\' well. when you start off, it might be a good idea to use the sensitive or whitening head since the bristles are softer and more gentle on your gums until you\'re used to the \'power\' of an electric toothbrush.overall, i do love the toothbrush and even bought a couple additional ones for my family as gifts. so, i definitely recommend it."

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17 (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)What worries me about this listing is that it claims to be the Extrasoft EB17, but the picture of the item shows the Flexisoft EB17.  Be warned, Amazon might be confused about this item and selling it incorrectly labeled.  On the Extrasoft EB17, all the bristles around the outside edge are the same color.  If you\'re looking for Extrasoft, make sure you find an item where the picture matches the description."

It uses the same heads and oscillates almost as fast but costs a lot less. The batteries seem to last for a while but you could try using rechargeable batteries. One of the best features is the circuitry that boosts the voltage of your batteries as they age in order to keep the motor speed constant. That way you don\'t have to change batteries until they are completely dead.

Being able to see the brushing guide combined with the indication from the brush itself telling me when to continue on to the other \'quadrant\' of teeth is super effective. I didn\'t realize how scantily I\'d been brushing in the past until I used this device. And WOW do my teeth ever feel clean and polished! I can think of absolutely NOTHING negative to say about this cool brush. I was skeptical about spending this much money, but I feel it is well-worth the money.

In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.This Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more toothpaste.What I do like:>>  The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all.  Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  Trust me on this.>>  The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.>>  I love the rubber grip handle.  My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.>>  Will go over a week between charges.  I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging.>>  Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.What I do NOT like:>>  No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.>>  The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I\'ve ever encountered.  My knife gouged into the rubber hand grip and I nearly cut myself twice.  If you have the option of choosing this with frustration-free packaging, get that one instead.I hate visiting my dentist.

It is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I\'ve owned, and my last one lasted 13 years. When it started to loose its charge while I was brushing my teeth I looked at what was available and decided on the 5000.I like that it has a space to store 4 brush heads, so I won\'t have to search for where I placed the extra ones when its time to change it. Also, the contour of the handle is very nice.On one of the reviews I read before I bought it, someone was unhappy with the timer. It\'s a nice, waterproof digital clock and you do not have to sync it up with the toothbrush if you don\'t want to. I did so I could tell when I\'m applying too much pressure. If you do use the timer, at 2 minutes you get a smiley face, and at 2 1/2 minutes it winks at you.The one thing I don\'t really like is that every 30 seconds it pulses to let you know to move to the next area of your mouth, but I do not brush my teeth in sections like they want you to. I asked my Dental Hygienist, who also uses one, and she doesn\'t do it their way either.She also recommended that I leave the handle off the charger until the charge wears down. The toothbrush has a \'Smart\' battery and she has heard of people having problems with the battery not holding a charge if it is keep constantly charging. The handle shows how much charge the battery has so I only charge it once a week or so.The travel case that comes with it is another nice feature. Since it holds a charge well, you can take a weekend trip, or a week, if only one person is using the handle, without having to pack the charger. There is room for two brush heads in the travel case."

They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That\'s a real laugh.

Those are shaped more like a conventional toothbrush, rectangular,rather than round like this unit.  I always thought the Cross Action did a good enough job so I never splurged on a more expensive unit.  Well, after trying the Oral-b 3000, I find I like the 3000 much better.  I have less of a tendency to \'brush\' my teeth with the 3000, and I know you aren\'t supposed to brush with an electric toothbrush, just move the brush around slowly.  Being smaller in head size, it is easier to maneuver and I feel it does a better job getting  to all the teeth surfaces.  I love the added bonus of the 30 second timer on  the 3000.  At first I thought something was wrong when every 30 seconds it would seem like the toothbrush was powering down, but it just is a timer to let you know to move on.  It has a 2 minute timer so you can focus on doing 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  How fun is that!  The red \'too much pressure\' light is also handy, and I had to push pretty hard to get to light up, such that is was uncomfortable on my teeth.  Some of you may need the warning light, but the pain was enough for me to stop the pressure.  I do like this toothbrush, but I also agree that it is costly and buying replacement heads are costly, so it is a continuing investment.  Still, these clean so much better than manual toothbrushes.  My kids have been using them for years and between the two of them they have had 1 cavity.  So perhaps these do pay for themselves in the long run."

Not so with this junk thing.  They tell you to brush like normal.It\'s like a glorified 5-dollar battery operated crest crapola.Don\'t buy at any price.Also, the 5-dollar battery operated one would be better because of the design flaw that this one has.

And, there is no sense in repeating all of the great things in all of the excellent in-depth reviews on this Oral-B Toothbrush.Con:  THE WIRELESS SMART GUIDE\'S CLOCK CAN ONLY BE SET AT 12:00.Response:  The wireless smart guide clock can be set to either 12 or 24 hour a day clock.And, I love having the clock sitting on my bathroom counter top to help me keep track  of my morning schedule.Con:  YOU REALLY DON\'T NEED THIS PART AS IT ONLY TELLS YOU WHEN  THE RECOMMENDED TIME OF 2 MINUTES IS DONE.Response:  As is stated above, it is also a very accurate clock and can also keep track of the 45 second brushing cycles.  I like this feature.  Also, if you tend to brush too firmly a little red light flashes on the LCD screen and the pulsation of the brush stops.Con:  You\'ll also receive a timer that reminds you when to move to a different quadrant of your mouth; a useless gimmick for an adult, in my opinion.Response:  I am an adult and I still love this feature.  It is very easy not to brush your teeth long enough especially if you are in a hurry.  The timer doesn\'t allow this to happen.Now, some extra PROs:Previously I was a diehard Philips Sonicare user for many years.  But, I was having some problems with my gums and deep plaque buildup.  I finally decided that there must be something better and more effective.  After much research online and with my dentist\'s input, I decided on the Oral-B.  I absolutely love the deep cleaning feature and brush head.  Actually, I never use any other head or brushing strength other than the deep cleaning mode and brush head.  The brush head has numerous styles of bristles that accomplish different things from deep cleaning, removing plaque, cleaning between teeth, massaging gums, etc.  You couldn\'t give me my Philips Sonicare back.My original hesitance was the price.  But, it was worth the money considering I only have one set of teeth and gums.One minor CON:  The user manual was not written to be user friendly.  It does a poor job of explaining how to set the Smart Guide Clock features.  Just be prepared to read it carefully and keep it nearby for a few days.  When you consider all of the awesome features, the user manual is not worth losing a start or a half star."
2672,2740,20100828,B003UKKHB4,4,"August 28, 2010",A1SMHIPICUSIFP,Pleasantly Surprised,"I\'ve never used an electric toothbrush before, despite it being recommended by some dentists I\'ve visited. Then again, other dentists have said they\'re nothing special, and careful brushing using a regular toothbrush is just fine. Anyway, I certainly can\'t seen any harm in trying one and after just a few days of use so far, I\'m already beginning to think it was a worthwhile decision.The Oral-B 3000 is easy to use, feels reasonably solid in hand, and is simple to keep clean (it\'s nice that the brush can be removed quickly to rinse out). I was a little nervous the first time I tried it, expecting bleeding gums or soreness, but in fact the opposite has been true. Because there\'s no need to scrub hard, it\'s actually quite gentle, though the sensation is a little strange at first and it took me a few tries to get used to it. I felt it was really getting my gum-line clean, and because they recommend just two minutes (30 seconds per \'quadrant\') I was actually more aware than I usually am with a regular toothbrush about reaching every corner of my mouth and teeth... I guess with no \'instructions\' and years of just using a normal toothbrush, it\'s sometimes easy to forget what we learned as children when it comes to brushing our teeth!So, I\'m happy so far. My mouth and teeth have never felt so clean immediately after brushing (note, that \'clean\' feeling of course quickly disappears once you eat again), though the way the device vibrates against my jaw is a little perturbing, but I\'ll just have to get used to that. I\'d have liked to have seen a few more brush heads supplied with the product as I feel those will get expensive. I noticed the Oral-B site mentions this product coming with four different brushes, but the package states that we only get the one. There appear to be a variety of different brushes available, but I\'m not sure how useful they all are... I\'ll probably stick to just the original one as it already does a better job than a regular brush at polishing my teeth, and I\'m not sure how well the other ones would work. There is one brush with two heads though, that could be interesting to try and might clean even better. Fortunately, these replacement heads are not horribly expensive online, despite being considerably more than a normal toothbrush and lasting about as long. Still, it\'s a small price to pay for that \'clean teeth\' feel, I think."

The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I\'d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a \'recognized name\' in oral hygiene (for whatever that\'s worth), and it\'s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).Since I don\'t have firsthand experience with other moto-brushes, I can\'t write a comparative review, but I CAN comment on this product\'s effectiveness in comparison with regular brushes, and that comparison is altogether favorable. Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before. This model features a two-minute timer, which is helpful. It\'s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well (I use it twice a day, and only need to charge it about once every eight days).Oral-b manufactures a variety of different heads for the Vitality line, and though I\'ve not tested the different varieties to see if they have markedly different results, I like the fact that the product is so well-supported; it means I probably won\'t soon find myself owning an obsolete brush for which I can\'t get replacement heads. The heads are sturdy, too, lasting me about three weeks or a month each.Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn\'t do things I don\'t need it to, doesn\'t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support.

It also buzzes after each 30 seconds to change quantrants you are brushing and buzzes 3 times at the end of 2 minutes. The charging unit is a lot smaller than the previous one, which is nice if you have limited counter space in your bathroom.  The charge last about one week, and it takes at least 12 hours to charge the brush. Overall I am very satisfied with this brushing unit.  Ii would highly recommend it."

I do not, however, like the pro white heads that came with the brush. I bought the precision clean heads and love those. They are made to work with the Vitality. This is only packaged and called the Vitality Pro White because it\'s the vitality model with pro white heads... Any heads made for Oral-B will work with this except for the Sonic heads.This brush is great, although it seems it\'s a bit underpowered. When brushing my back teeth and trying to get behind the tooth the motor isn\'t as powerful as it you were just brushing the front teeth but it\'s fine it still does the job just fine. I leave the brush on the charger when not in use so I can\'t attest to how long the battery lasts. Oral-B says that it will last 20 minutes or about 10 2-minute brushing periods. I personally think that\'s low for a modern electronic toothbrush but I leave it on the charger so I don\'t have to deal with a low battery.I brush at minimum 3 times a day. Usually more. I contacted my dentist asking if it was bad and she said that it\'s fine and I told her I was using the Vitality and she said that it was no problem, \'brush as often as you\'d like\'.. So I\'m not worried about gum recession or ruining my tooth enamel with it.I moved from a manual brush to the electronic brush and found at first that the vibrating (oscillating?) was making my gums and the tip of my nose tickelish. I\'ve gotten used to it and it doesn\'t seem to affect me like that anymore.I do drool a lot when brushing and the toothpasty drool goes down the handle on the brush and makes the handle a mess, so I rinse it off half way through and after brushing. The brush is completely waterproof, although I wouldn\'t submerge it...So all in all I really love this brush and rate it a 5/5. We\'ll see in 6 months how my brushing habits are when I go in for my next cleaning. I try to be very thorough and usually brush at least 3 minutes to make sure I get every nook and cranny so if I have tartar that is an unusual build-up I\'ll modify this review.I recommend this brush 100%!"

While it\'ll be another 6 months before I know if my gums have stopped receding, I\'m confident that this toothbrush has benefited my routine already. First, bc of the motion sensor and timer, I now realize that I have been brushing much longer and harder than I\'ve needed to for probably my entire life. Second, despite the fact that I\'m no longer scrubbing my teeth with all my strength (I actually use the lighter \'Sensitive\' setting with the sensitive brush heads), my teeth look and feel much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush, there\'s less noticeable plaque buildup, and I\'ve been able to maintain that just-cleaned-at-the-dentist feeling for over a month (as opposed to a few days before).

You know, when he gets the polisher out and rubs your teeth with it.  That is pretty much the same sensation you get with this brush.  I had to learn to not hold it against my teeth so hard because it was vibrating my entire head.I have to caveat.  I also own a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  To be honest, I think that the Sonicare feels better on my gums and also I think it does a better job overall.  HOWEVER, I hate my sonicare because of the way it grows mold.  The new sonicare models get your nasty toothpaste-spit mixture inside of the brush head where you can\'t see it growing mold.  Unless you actually unscrew the head and wash it out every day, and leave it taken apart to dry out, you will get mold inside your sonicare - and once that happens the brush pretty much smells like mold for the duration of its life (there may even be mold inside of the handle itself which I just cannot see without breaking it).This is not the case for the Oral-b Vitality.  The vitality features a snap-on type head which has no cracks to allow water to seep through.  The new sonicare features a flexible head, which I believe creates the problem with the mold (the old sonicares did not flex nor did they have the same mold problem).  The Viatlity head does not flex, it\'s just a straight snap-on piece with a rotating brush head at the top.Another thing I like about the Vitality is that it has changeable heads.  There are different heads which you can attach for different uses: Floss-Action, Pro White, and Dual Clean heads.  I use the Floss-Action and Pro White attachments - 2 minutes for each attachment.  The Floss action feels somewhat similar to a normal brush and gets all the stuff off your teeth, but the Pro-White has a weird yellow rubber thing in the middle of the bristles which rubs up against your teeth and whitens/polishes them.The Vitality also beats the sonicare in that it\'s brush heads come in packs of 3 for $20, whereas the sonicare offers packs of 2 for $20 (however, I believe the sonicare claims it lasts for 6 months and the vitality for 3).BATTERIES - the sonicare lasted about a month on a single charge - the Vitality only lasts about 2 weeks.That is all I can think of to put in this review.  The only reason I gave this brush 4 stars instead of five is because I wish it had more of a Sonicare vibration action - however it has an interesting rotating action which takes some getting used to.  The Vitality just doesn\'t feel like it cleans the gumline as well as the sonicare did - but at the same time it feels like it cleans the surface of the teeth better than the sonicare."

They should have used a nickel metal hydride or lithium ion/polymer rechargeable battery instead. Or, include an option to use regular AA batteries. Ni-Cad batteries are notoriously memory prone and don\'t really last long at all. In fact, the instructions for this unit state not to leave the charger/stand plugged in unless the unit is ready to be charged up. This is because if you charge it when it isn\'t fully drained, the battery will not last as long on subsequent charges due to the memory issue. Oral-b should be ashamed of themselves for incorporating such a lame battery in what could be a more useful product with a better internal battery.Luckily, I have an old Oral-b power toothbrush that takes regular AA batteries and the brushes from this unit fit on it! So, when the stupid ni-cad battery on this unit fails, I can use my old base and regular AA batteries but still use the dual head brush attachment.I can\'t recommend anyone buy this based on the fact that the battery is not viable. If you can find one that takes regular batteries I think that would be better for you (you can use rechargeable in that if you want)."

Buzzing about in my mouth and definately making the gum area very clear and stimulated. A real massaging of the gums - which I know from my dentist that this is a good thing. Healthy for the gums.It was really amazing. It felt incredibly clean and especially clear of foreign materials. I am a flosser by nature as well..and I noticed after several days of usage...that my flossing showed less and less particles between my teeth. And those particles came out easier - even popcorn!What\'s really nice is it comes with and extra brush - either for use with two peeople or use one as your back up and it plugs into the wall nicely. There is no battery replacement however because it is magnetically charged the hand unit does not plug intothe wall. Free from cord or plug issues being close to water.It was packed well and comes complete with operational instructions as well as infomation on how to brush properly with it.

I had been using traditional toothbrushes which also had heads that seemed too large for my mouth.The first time I used the Oral-B Vitality I felt as if I had just come from the dentists office. My gums were bleeding and slightly tender.This is not a bad thing! Plainly put,the toothbrush delivered an efficient clean. My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.Since I keep the toothbrush in my bedroom (not enough outlets in the bathroom) I charge it only every other night.  It seems to hold the charge for the nights I forget to plug it in. Nice to know if I go on a business trip and leave the charger behind.While it gets into the crevices in my teeth, flossing should still be a separate step for getting in between the teeth."

I thought it was still working fine, but compared to a nice new one, i might as well have not been brushing my teeth. This gets your teeth super clean and they stay feeling clean for a long time. Whips your gums into shape too. The size of the brush head is a little larger than the precision clean. I am expecting this to last for quite a while."

I used to use the Sonicare Elite 9500.3. I just opened the package yesterday evening and have used it twice so far.4. I needed a new brush because my old brush\'s battery died.*Brushing*Pros1. I am happy with the cleaning that I am getting.2. The brush feels like it is massaging my gums.*Charging*Pros1. This brush is dual voltage and will work both in 110v and 220v areas.2. This base of the brush seems much more stable than my  Sonicare since it is a little wider.*Traveling*Pros1. The brush does include a travel case.2. Since the travel case is plastic, it will be much easier to clean though compared to the cloth Sonicare case I had.Cons1. The travel case is MUCH larger than my old Sonicare.2. The travel case appears that it is more likely to break since the plastic hinge area seems like it can wear down.3. The brush heads do not have a plastic cap to help protect the bristles.  I liked that the Sonicare had this option since I was reassured that nothing dirty was touching the bristles while transporting it.*Operation*Cons1. I could not figure out how to get the brush to offer an audible cue when switching quadrants while connected to the SmartGuide.  It only offers an audible cue when the radio is turned off.*Cost*Pros1. This brush is much cheaper than the latest Sonicare.2. Replacement brush heads are much cheaper than the Sonicare (by about half the price).*Maintenance*Pros1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush heads appears that it will be much easier to clean unlike my Sonicare which always had a lot of buildup that was difficult to clean.Cons1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush head is a relatively small metal rod.  I am concerned that if I drop the toothbrush, this may bend and I would be unable to load any brush heads.2. On either side of the brush, there is a section with a silver coating.  Unfortunately, this stains easily with water stains.  I wish that Oral-B had used something that would help avoid the water stains.Overall, I am content with the brush. I wouldn\'t consider myself a Sonicare convert since this isn\'t perfect either, but I plan on keeping this brush."

The electric cord is about 4 feet long and there are slots on the back and both sides to direct the cord in 3 different directions. There is no provision to hide extra slack of the cord inside the base.Braun seems to go out of their way to hide the fact that wall-mounting is available.

They try to sell you all sorts of extra frills. No need for them. This basic model has what makes the difference - the high rotation speed. It works great, battery lasts for many rounds of brushing if you forget to put it back on the base. It is much easier to clean your teeth with this thing than with a manual brush.

2248,2300,20101202,B002HWS9GG,4,"December 2, 2010",A3RZXOS53C9JW3,Upgrade from alkaline battery operated Sonicare,The Oral-B is a great toothbrush that gives more options than necessary. Let me just start off by mentioning why I rated this product 4 instead of 5 stars. All of the different setting on the brush seem fairly pointless so I think it it would be easy to downgrade to another Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series Toothbrush without the \'massaging\' \'whitening\' or \'deep clean\' settings. So this isn\'t really a negative aspect of the product but something that the consumer is paying for and doesn\'t seem to be getting any extra benefit. Save yourself the extra cash and just get one of the more basic models; I only use the daily clean setting.Since using the Oral-B I do believe that my teeth gave become more white and have a greater overall brush experience. I think this has much to do with the included \'Pro-White\' head that is included along with the \'Floss Action\' head. The rubber cup on the head really wipes away plaque and buildup. I can\'t really say that the \'Floss Action\' head is all that the name seems to claim but it does seem to be a great everyday head to use when accompanied with daily flossing.Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Oral-B Professional Care Series to anyone looking to take great care of their teeth.

The pulsonic has a light that just shows when it\'s charging.  The pubsonic has a larger brush head but this brush gives a deeper clean, which is also somewhat of a downside due to the noise that\'s produced by the power behind the brush.

2662,2728,20100915,B003UKKHB4,3,"September 15, 2010",AHFGCH8LANEZK,Oral-b vs. Sonicare,"I am a nut when it comes to dental care.  I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  I floss daily and have used a Sonicare electric brush for close to 15 years.  It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  That was a bit much for me.  And my teeth weren\'t that bad, it\'s just that he was very fastidious.  I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  And I ALWAYS swish my mouth out with water after eating or drinking anything.Anyway, when I got the chance to try this Oral-b, of course I was up for the challenge.  When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the other.After trying the Oral-b for a week, I can tell you that I am definitely a Sonicare person.  Here is the breakdown of my experience:Oral-b pros:*Handle feels nice in hand.  It has a silicone/rubbery grip that is ergononimic*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.Oral-b cons:*Way too noisy.  I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  Not a relaxing experience, I felt too stressed with all of the noise, lights, and buzzing.*The depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush head.*It does not stop after 2 minutes of brushing.  I am used to the way the Sonicare handle stops working after you\'ve hit the 2 minute mark.  With the Sonicare if I want to keep brushing after the 2 minutes, I just press the button again.  With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn\'t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  Next bullet point.*Loud humming with surge pulse.  This is Oral-b\'s answer to Sonicare\'s quadrant pacer, where it nudges you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn\'t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!*Single button control. It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.*Cleanliness?  I didn\'t feel like my teeth were any cleaner than they already were when I used my Sonicare.I still believe that liking the Oral-b or Sonicare is a matter of personal preference.  Cost analysis-wise, the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  But I prefer the Sonicare."

Well, my brushing habits and checkups slipped over the years and that left me with alot of bad teeth and plaque buildup.I now get regular dental care and try my best to keep my teeth looking their best. that\'s where this product comes into play.the design is wonderful. simply place toothpaste on the replaceable head and brush all your teeth including your gumline. you will get the feeling that you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. this gets deep into every nook and cranny of your mouth. it really works and stregthens your gums, and if you floss regularly your gums will no longer bleed when brushing.battery life is mediocre, sometimes lasting a a month or longer depending on frequency of use. i use mine roughly 3 times a day and i get about 5 weeks out of  a standard raovac AA battery. which to me, is acceptable.don\'t not press down to hard when brushing, this will cause the head to wear out faster than need be, and it will fray very easily if you use alot of pressure. just go ahead put some toothpaste on the head and play your favorite 3 minute song, and you will be on your way to better oral health. the benefits from switching from manual toothbrushes to this one have been enormous! my dentist actually commented on how clean my teeth were.this is a cheaper alternative to paying 60, 70, or 80 bucks for the higher end models. replacement heads are a little more expensive than normal manual toothbrushes but having cleaner teeth was a sacrifice i was willing to make.an overall great product. good alternative to more expensive brands. way to go oral b!"

I was looking to buy an electric toothbrush when I came across this at a local store.  The price caught my eye, and so I went home to do my research.  There wasn\'t much info/reviews at the time, but what was out there was positive.  So I went back the next day and got it.  After using manual toothbrushes for our entire lives, my husband and I were very surprised how much cleaner our teeth felt.  Like I said, we have never used an electric one before, so this is not a comparison of other electric toothbrushes.  My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual so it\'s not that important to me.  I am still amazed at the length of the charge, we can go a week with two people using it twice daily.  The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  I have found some info about defective and/or counterfit heads.  It is still going strong after almost 2 years of daily use, with no sign of lessening power or charge.  Overall, I think the price and quality of this toothbrush make it a great option."

This really isn\'t a problem, as when I went to the dentist after using this brush for a month, my teeth were almost perfectly clean.

Amazon claims that \'The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\'  But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush. The toothbrush does work, however. I have two identical Oral-B 3D excel toothbrushes purchased on 8/20/01.  To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  I run the battery down to zero on the one I\'m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it\'s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle itself.Some reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that\'s hard to imagine:  there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  It\'s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it. It\'s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better."

I mean, it\'s a toothbrush after all. WRONG. Once you\'ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you\'ll never go back.Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  Always have.  Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  However, I went ahead and gave it a try.In less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  I put on the toothpaste and away I went.  The best thing is the size of the rotating head: it\'s about the size of a tooth.  Gee: what a novel idea! As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  This allowed me to work on my teeth while moving towards my gums.  In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.One of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth. This was something I could NEVER do with a regular toothbrush.  I also have some very deep pockets in my gums that have a tendency to hurt and bleed. However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  Oral-b is a reliable brand and this is in keeping with the brand recognition.  I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  It\'s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera! ;)"

I find myself wrapping my thumb around the handle to hold it while brushing and, sometimes inadvertently, hitting the Mode button. So, I\'ll be brushing in one mode and then the brush will switch to a different mode -- this makes me have to hit the Mode button 3-4 times to cycle back through to the mode I want to use. Again, this is my fault, but I also blame it on the design of the brush.2) I find the brush head bristles to be way too hard/harsh. I have these brush heads: Floss Action, Precision Clean and Pro White. I am going to buy the so-called Sensitive brush head and give it a try.

But few complains about this specific model 5000.1) The handle on 5000 is much bigger than on other similar toothbrushes. It is less comfortable to hold in hand.2) The extra device coming with model 5000 is useless. It is supposedly an \'advanced\' timer which makes beeping noise when you need to switch sides of teeth to brush and when to stop brusing. I think, timers embedded in the toothbrush handle itself (what they do for less expensive models) do better job - there is absolutely no benefits to have timer separately (in addition it\'s screen is hard to see).3)The electric plug on this toothbrush is much longer than on other models. The base, though, is much smaller. Apparently they moved electronics from the base (where toothbrush stands) to the plug. It does not look good when plug is plugged in recepticle and it makes dificulties always to avoid pushing the plug.4) Another big complain - never received rebate. it was $50 rebate for this toothbrush when I bought it in August.

This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives. While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.Second thing to note, this shouldn\'t be a flossing replacement. You\'d think it\'d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely unnecessary.Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.So, with that, you\'d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right? Well, maybe not. For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn\'t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush. I don\'t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn\'t feel radically different from using a medium bristle brush.These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth clean.Finally, these heads seem to fit my teeth perfect, but I should note, I have a large mouth and large teeth. As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they\'d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/mouths.All in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone."

54,55,20050814,B00006ANDJ,5,"August 14, 2005",AS627L9YJHE1P,"An easy, safe, effective way to brush","Dentists all over the country are recommending the Oral-B electric toothbrush. There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  The number after the dash (for example EB17-3) just means how many toothbrush heads you\'ll be receiving.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads."
2611,2674,20100827,B003UKKH6O,3,"August 27, 2010",AOVROBZ8BNTP7,Low Cost For a Reason,"Overall, the Vitality is a nice toothbrush. If one trusts the packaging, it out performs a manual toothbrush.  If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It\'s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one\'s teeth during brushing.I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one\'s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.So, it\'s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs."

The Braun manufactured brush comes with the recharger base and 2 floss action brush heads for under $30 from Amazon which strikes me as, perhaps, the best bargain of all available powered brushes on the market because of the high quality and effective design.I\'ve been using the Sonicare system for roughly the last three years and I do love it, but the handle is bulky and the brush heads are expensive to replace.  I always have wondered if there was anything out there that was as good or better?  Enter this system...It actually seems to clean every bit as good, maybe better, and it makes my gums feel much more \'alive\' than the Sonicare does.  Judging by sink remnants it truly does clean at least as well, if not better.  I\'m guessing the floss action heads are truly small engineering marvels as they do seem to actually do what the name implies.  The size of the head suits me well after initially getting use to it.  That, combined with the more svelte handle allows me to easily get to the back of my teeth quite easily, better than the Sonicare IMHO.It is impossible to ignore that this system comes in noticably less in cost than the Sonicare too.  I\'ll still, on occassion, use the Sonicare, but this is my new favorite because it\'s effective cleaning and I really love the better stimulated feeling of my gums.  In fact, I will just say it:  I feel my teeth are cleaner and my gums much more invigorated with this winning product.  For me there are few downsides to this unit that I can think of.  Maybe the only thing I\'d like to have seen added was a brush guard, or holder, for sliding around the brush head when traveling...Otherwise, Oral B has hit a real \'homerun\' with this product which I feel works great, I enjoy immensely, and is a decent bargain too."

I have however tried cheaper versions, including crest and cheaper Oral-B\'s. This one is by far the best out of the different toothbrushes I\'ve tried! Firstly, it isn\'t dependent on batteries; it\'s rechargeable, which is great, so you dont have to spend money buying batteries every few weeks. Secondly, this model can be used with a few different brush attachments. the floss action is nice because it has a small head, which makes it easier to get to the hard to reach back molars. If it\'s too small for you, you can always use one of the bigger head attachments (not sure which ones go with this model, but I\'m sure you can find out on the Oral B website or somewhere here on Amazon). This leaves my teeth cleaner than any brush I\'ve used. They feel as clean as if I had just come from the dentist! The battery life is great too! It will last me two weeks with 2x a day brushing before I have to charge it. This leaves my teeth so clean, I\'m not sure how much cleaner a more expensive brush would even get my teeth, so this is definitely worth it!"

I was bleeding from my gums when she probed it. And I had cavities!Now I brush my teeth twice a day and after meals. I brush my teeth at least 2 minutes with the guidance of the SmartGuide or more if I\'m using the Deep Cleaning Mode.I have never been so proud and satisfied of my brushing attitude!!

There is a real deal breaker here.The Good: When compared to my Sonicare, this brand actually works better at removing plaque, and I really, really like the little pick brush. It gets into tight areas and along the gum line if you need it to.The Bad: There are problems with this product though. Even on the \'sensitive\' setting, the brushing can be a bit harsh. If it didn\'t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it\'s not. I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation. This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing. Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes. Yes, this one is supposed to beep, but my didn\'t always do that.The Ugly: Then there\'s the deal breaker - the handle is so small and it vibrates so intensely in my hand that it is painful to use on a daily basis. I have carpal tunnel on the right and an old stress fracture on the left, so even though this products does what it is supposed to do very well, I will continue to use my larger grip, smoother running Sonicare on  a regular basis and this product only once in  awhile for a \'spit polish.\' I would not recommend this product for anyone with large hands, previous or current hand injury or nerve damage, or any one with arthritis."

I like that it\'s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison.  On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare.  And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general. (I also have their Pulsonic razor)  I also like the design of the charging unit and extra cleaning attachment as well.But as I said earlier, I switched from Sonicare to an Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.  And for me, comparing this Pulsonic to the Triumph... well, there\'s just no comparison.  The Triumph is better by far.  Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you\'re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.I\'ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it\'s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won\'t last long.  I can bring my Triumph on a 10 day vacation without the charging unit (and I brush twice a day.)  I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn\'t have a big enough battery to do that.  And even if it does, that just goes to show you the cleaning power.  This one is subtle, and good if you have sensitive teeth and gums.So if you want a good, deep clean, buy the Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide."

The strength of the brushing on \'normal\' mode is certainly not gentle, but then again, that\'s what the \'sensitive\' mode is for. We always use the normal mode and we\'ve had no issues. The \'Floss Action\' heads seem to work quite well to remove some of the inter-dental debris, but flossing is still necessary.We were a little skeptical about the SmartGuide, but since buying this toothbrush was part of our plan to improve dental hygiene, we decided to give it a shot. We mounted it on the bathroom wall next to the mirror. The thing quickly detects when you start brushing and shows you a diagram and a timer, so you know how long you need to brush. The rest of the time, it\'s a handy clock! We actually really like it. It was worth spending a few extra bucks to get it.All in all, it was a great purchase and a huge step up from using a regular toothbrush. I would recommend it to anyone."

Yes, the Floss Action heads are a bit bigger, but I think that suits me fine, and you\'ll probably be down with it too unless you\'ve got really small teeth.I think this is the question you should ask yourself: Do you usually prefer soft/medium bristle toothbrushes, or do you tend to seek out the firms?

I have the more expensive model that briefly stops every 15 seconds so you know when to change quadrants in your mouth.I got this  \'Vitality Floss Action\' brush and have to say that for the money I think one would be hard pressed to find a better buy.I agree with the other positive reviewers on all the important points but most importantly to me is VALUE. This toothbrush does an excellent job of brushing and massaging the gums. Furthermore, I believe there are different specialty brush head replacements that can be purchased. It DOES have a two minute time. In my opinion this is just as good if not better than having a 15 second timer. If you just brush your whole mouth for the full two minutes you\'ll get just as thorough and perhaps more so than if you do 15 seconds peer quadrant because you\'ll have almost as much paste on the brush for the other quadrants of your mouth. With the 15 second per quadrant type of brushing, by the time you get to the final quadrant you\'ve pretty much used all the fresh tooth paste.This is a bare bones electric toothbrush. It doesn\'t come with a travel case but I love it and see no reason to spend an extra $100 for a fancier Oral B or the other leading competitor."
2350,2405,20101008,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 8, 2010",AIY2GUK4HEMMU,Very Pleased,"First off this is my first automatic toothbrush, so take what I review about the toothbrush with a grain of salt.I decided to buy this only because there is a 50% rebate from Oral-B with the purchase.  Normally I wouldn\'t buy a toothbrush for $100, but in a few weeks when I get $50 back, it will justify me spending $50, even though that seems a little steep for a toothbrush.  But nevertheless, its a steal of a deal right now.So onto the product. Overall I am very pleased with it.  My teeth felt amazingly smooth and clean after the first brushing.Since I\'m not an automatic toothbrush guru, I am not sure of the sizes and noise of others.  In my own opinion, I feel like it is a tad heavy and large.  But once again, its got a motor and battery in it unlike my manual toothbrush.I read other reviews about the base of the unit and storage compartment for the brush heads being too large.  I however have to disagree with that.  The base unit is just larger than the base of the toothbrush, as the toothbrush sits in it to charge.  The storage part holds 4 tips and snaps to the base.  Once again, I don\'t know how others compare, but to me the size of it seems perfect for my counter space (about 8 sq ft).The plug however seems large.  But oh well, I\'m also not an electrician so I don\'t know why it needs to be that big.The Wireless Smartguide is pretty cool as well.  It gives you a timer and choice of count up or count down modes and a ingenious idea of having 4 zones (for each section of teeth).  This 4 zone thing blinks for 30 seconds indicating which zone you should be brushing in and provides a visual timer of when to move on.  It makes it idiot proof for brushing for the correct time.  I find myself brushing for about 4 minutes because the 2 minutes fly by which is a plus to the health of my teeth and gums.I am really impressed with the \'extras\'.  Really, when you buy electronics you ALWAYS need to get your own batteries for it.  With this, the Wireless Smartguide came with 2 AA batteries in it, as well as 2 more.  4 batteries!!! You never get batteries included let alone EXTRA batteries.  Ha, needless to say, that\'s coll Oral-B.  You also get 2 brushing heads, the normal flossification head and the pro-white head.  That\'s another plus with getting another brush head included in the package.  You also get the travel case.  Which I haven\'t used yet, but still cool.I have read others complain of the \'roughness\' of the brushing.  The manual does state that it can take time for your teeth to become used to the brush and your gums may bleed some.  I however had no problems gum bleeding or feeling like the toothbrush was too rough.The only negative I can say about this toothbrush is sometimes while brushing the chewing surfaces of my teeth, the back of the brush head hits the opposite chewing surface.  It doesn\'t hurt, but it doesn\'t feel great either.  Guess I just need to remember and learn to keep my mouth open more while brushing.All in all, great product and would definitely recommend to my family and friends during the promotion period where you get 50% back.  Can\'t wait for my rebate check!"

To be on the safe side, I charged it for the full 16-hr recommended charge time before initial use.  It comes with two identical interchangeable brush heads.  I plan to have my two young children use the brush, however, the brushes are identical, with no markings to distinguish them, so I marked one brush at the base with a permanent marker to indicate the difference.  The brushing action is robust and does a good job of scrubbing tooth surfaces.  There is no need for additional pressure or manual brush strokes.  The brush has a built-in timer and makes a stuttering sound after you have brushed for two minutes.  My kids enjoy the brush and don\'t find it overly harsh or difficult to use.  I was quite pleased with the results and feel it does a better job than relying on them to properly use the manual brush.  The two-minute timer also makes sure they brush for a sufficient duration.  We\'re approaching two weeks of use without a recharge.  That\'s pretty good battery life, considering it\'s used twice a day by two people.  So it\'s a pretty good brush, especially if you have kids or don\'t want to spend a fortune on one of the fancier more expensive power toothbrushes."

I am able to eat with relative abandon again (after getting braces) once I learned how to use the SmartSeries 5000 properly and in a systematic way.The SmartSeries 5000 (with an ortho brush head and power tip attachment) has made brushing and cleaning with braces on extremely easy and a no-brainer.The kit includes a handy travel case (with holders for two attachments), lightweight charger, and timer which links wirelessly to the toothbrush.I usually start with the power tip which is very effective in cleaning debris around brackets and between the wires.  To clean with the ortho brush head, simply press it in front of each tooth and count slowly to twelve -- going from the rear molars to the front teeth on each side on both top and bottom rows of teeth. After that, just brush the biting surfaces and rear of the teeth.Overall, the kit components were very useful to me except for the timer.The timer would display a ring which represented the top and bottom rows of teeth.  The ring was split into four sections and the timer would indicate the amount of time needed for each quadrant of teeth.  It was somewhat tricky to clean by the quadrant and just easier for me to use a fixed count for each tooth."

YES.Bottom line I guess is does it get the job done. It works. It certainly feels better than regular ole toothbrushes. It feels like the rotating head is really getting into the gumline.What\'s really nice is that this toothbrush and my other Oral-B both accept the same replaceable brush heads which is great since they usually come in packs of more than one.I recommend this product.

Regular brushing was apparently to rough on my gums.  The product makes brushing more interesting, I hope it lasts.  The charge lasts longer than you would think."
2133,2183,20110318,B002HWS9GG,5,"March 18, 2011",AW7BGAR3VSIY5,Great Toothbrush,"I bought the Oral-B 5000 brush after doing extensive research. This was my first electric or powered toothbrush. I will not compare it with Philips Sonicare as both are excellent brushes. I went with oral-b as I prefer a rotatory brush over a one that just moves up and down. If like me you are new to electric toothbrush and are wondering if it will be too harsh on your teeth and gums, then I can assure you that I found this oral-b 5000 very gentle. If fact, I would have preferred if it had a little bit more power. I have healthy teeth and gums so for someone who has very sensitive teeth this might be an issue. This brush however has a sensitive mode which reduces the power considerably so you can still go with it.The oral-b 5000 box came with a brush handle (oral-b trimph), 2 brush heads (1 flossaction. 1 prowhite), a smart guide, traveling case, a charging station (charging ring + brushhead storage stand) and a smart plug. An important note: only the oral-b 5000 and 4000 series come with a smart plug (100-240 V) adapter. Others 3000 and lower versions just work for US voltage only and you will need to buy a voltage converter if you want to travel with it. You can tell by looking at the pictures on the outside of the box. Smart plug is bigger as it has voltage conversion circuitry inside it, the other one is just an electric plug. Since I travel frequently, so this was very important to me and thus my choice was limited to 4000 or 5000 series only.Difference between the 4000 and 5000 is that 5000 has a smart guide and the charging station that has a place to store 4 extra brush heads, plus 5000 has one extra mode of operation. Other than that both are identical. The smart guide is not essential for brushing. It just shows you various information like the brushing mode you are using, total brush time, low battery indicator, over pressure warning. It also similes and winks at you! I find it convenient as all the information is in front of me, and if I wanted to change my brushing mode, I do not need to take the toothbrush out of my mouth. The toothbrush always starts in the daily clean mode and you cannot turn it on outside your mouth, as it then sprays toothpaste all over the counter and sink, so if it was not for the smart guide, you will find it very difficult to select the desired brushing mode on the toothbrush.The brush handle and brush heads are made in Germany. They appear well-constructed. The brush handle is water proof and factory sealed against moisture. This is very important as otherwise the moisture will ruin the battery and the circuitry inside, a common problem with electric brushes powered with replaceable AA batteries. The toothbrush is charged through magnetic induction, so it is safe to put the charging station on the bathroom counter, near water. Brush heads are easy to clean and replace. In fact, more than 1 person can use the brush handle, as the only thing that goes into the mouth is the brush head and each person can use their own brush head. The brush heads come with their own colored rings, so you cannot mix your brush head with someone else. The battery life is good and with my typical brushing time of 4-5 minutes twice a day, it lasts for 4-5 days.Finally, about the price. I got the 50% off offer, so the 5000 ended up costing me about $65. It was an excellent deal for me. Is this brush worth $159? Well, I would have to say no. If you can get it for below $100 then it is an excellent deal. Is it better than a manual toothbrush? I would have to say yes! It is 200% better than a manual toothbrush. In fact, after using this you will wonder why you did not switch before.Now, if the brush handle lasts for 3 years and each brush head lasts for at least 5 months, then I will be satisfied with my $65 down payment on this toothbrush.I hope my review was useful. I have tried to concentrate on information I did not find in other reviews. If anyone needs additional information just write a comment on this review and I will respond."

The reviews and the rebate attracted me to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. I especially liked the polishing mode, since I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth. I didn\'t think that I\'d use the clock/timer/sensor, but I decided to put it up to have a small clock in my bathroom. I\'m using it all of the time! I give my teeth a \'spa treatment\' - floss, polish, massage gums...and feel like I\'ve had a professional cleaning. Having always been a diligent brusher, I was surprised to see that I could benefit from the reminder to brush each of the four areas for 30 seconds. The little warning light that tells me when I\'m exerting pressure (and thus brushing too hard - all you have to do is hold the brush up to the surface of the tooth and let it do the cleaning) is useful for breaking a bad habit that seems to crop up in the same place quite often.I even like the smiley face as a reward for good brushing, although I usually tend to be rather jaded about such things. I think that I\'ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. And I\'m also glad for the travel case since I hated to make trips without my Bruan (you just can\'t got back to manual brushing after you\'re brushed this well), but I\'d find that the \'on\' button sometimes got pressed in my luggage and used up the charge. The base for the Oral-B is also small enough to pack easily."

I really like the Oral-B because it has a small rechargeable base therefore the power of the toothbrush is consistent (unlike replacement battery units).  These replacement brush heads were a great value.  I like the \'dual clean\' since it has the revolving round bristles (on top) and the bristles that move up and down (on the bottom).  These brush heads make my teeth feel so clean that I feel like I just left the dentist office.  I particularly like that the blue bristles fade through time reminding you that it\'s time to replace the brush head (they last around 2-3 months depending on how often you brush).

It took nearly 24 hours before the green charge lights quit blinking. They stop when the charge is complete. I\'m very happy with how clean my teeth seem after my first brushing session. The sealed box came with one FlossAction brush head.The handle I received says, \'TRIUMPH Professional Care\' and has the green charge lights on a gray background. It is NOT the digital display. My first guess is that this is the older model but some reviewers said they called Oral-B and were told the handles with a non-digital display (like mine) are the newest model, so I\'m not sure. I\'m also not sure if there are any improvements with a newer model - other than the display - that would make me want to be sure and have the newer model? I noticed that Amazon sales of the 4000 model are temporarily on hold while they investigate what appears to be the same issue.For now, I am happy and content with what I have. If anyone knows or learns more about this issue please let us know! The toothbrush seems excellent!Update: After reading through the model 5000 reviews going back to 2009, I now think that mine is a newer model afterall. Originally, they came with a 110/220 volt power adapter with the electronics built into the AC plug which made the plug that goes into the AC outlet overly large (some reviewers complained about the large plug). Mine has just a small basic 2-prong AC plug. Mine is 110 volt only and the electronics are in the charging base where the brush handle sits. Older units came with 2 or 3 brush heads. Mine came with only 1. So, it appears that Oral-B decided to cut some costs by removing the dual voltage and 1 or 2 extra brush heads. They also decided to change the LCD handle display to LED. Hopefully, they also added some improvements?! I\'m still happy."
3056,3142,20111217,B0043VYSI2,5,"December 17, 2011",A2H2HDAZCKDSSO,Good Toothbrush,I\'ve been using an Oral B for many years now.  I\'m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  When you have teeth that are not straight like I do the back sides of your teeth are very hard to reach and the smaller round head on the brush I find reaches the hard to get areas better than the longer rectangular brushes.  Doesn\'t straighten your teeth though.  Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I\'m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  I tend to think that is glamor over substance.  After all the brush is just rotating in an oscillating motion purre and simple.  It works and works well.  My model hesistates at the end of two minutes and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  You still need to floss and thats expected.  I have been very pleased with my last unit.  I didn\'t save the box and the model number isn\'t on it so I cant say which one it is.  I\'ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  Good product and will continue to use till new technology comes up with something better.

The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush. I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well. Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH. I stand by this toothbrush as a high-quality product. It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.>>I have 5 dental implants, so taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.At a recent visit to my dentist I was told I had receeding gums around one of my implants. The problem? Part of it was that the implant crown wasn\'t seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard. The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.I went to Target and bought their generic \'Up & Up\' brand electric toothbrush. This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums. However, when the Oral-b 3000 came out on Amazon Vine, I knew I had to order & review it.The Oral-b 3000 does NOT disappoint. For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic \'Up & Up\' model I was using before. Second, it actually lights up when you\'re brushing too hard. I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I\'m distracted and in a hurry to get to work. It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.Another nice feature is the \'timer\' function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits. This is also nice, as many of us tend to hurry through our brushing routine. The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom. The brush unit\'s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn\'t notice a decrease in power. This is a nice contrast with my Up & Up toothbrush which, though it claims it\'ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.I\'ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far. My old unit is in storage and probably won\'t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas. I haven\'t made use of the different brushing modes, but I\'m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth, will appreciate these.All in all the brush unit, brush head, and charger included in this package are all great and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than, the competing brands/brushes. The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth & gums, the unit pays for itself handily. I recommend!"

When I told her I was glad to see that she endorsed the floss action she nearly had a stroke.She didn\'t realize that was the head that was on her demo unit and told her assistant to change it. She said she used the floss head once and was mortified by its over-exuberance. She tells all her clients to throw away the floss head and use the sensitive brush ...\'"

Unfortunately the competitive price of this product did not make up for the poor quality and unsafety of it. During brushing, small pieces of metal came out of the toothbrush heads and shot into the gums and lips, sometimes causing lacerations. After this, the round brushing part of the head would come loose itself.After 3 of the toothbrush heads did this, I contacted the seller by email and then by phone and explained the problem to them. They apologized and explained that this was a generic product from a chinese manufacturer and although they had never run into this/any problem with their products before, they would send me a replacement (oral B original) product. I agreed.Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, as I began to use these \'original oral B\' toothbrush heads, the same problem has recurred with pieces of metal shooting out of the rotating toothbrush head during brushing and hitting the gums and lips. I\'ve been using oral B electric toothbrushes for a few years and have never seen anything like this. I\'m not exactly sure if this second set I have received are really oral B products or not.My point is that low price apparently means poor quality, at least in the case of this seller."

It produces a STRONG vibration...VERY strong.  Not for the young child or the sensitive mouth.  I seriously felt like I\'d put a power drill into my mouth!That being said, I\'d have to say it is worth the uncomfortable feeling (which I\'m starting to get used to) -- even after just the first use, my teeth looked shiny and polished, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  And despite the strong vibration, I didn\'t have any issues with my gums bleeding.  I think it just takes some getting used to, especially if, like me, you\'re not used to using a power toothbrush.So I would say that the only downside is that you can\'t control the level of vibration -- it\'s either on or off.  Sometimes it would be nice to turn it down a bit (especially in the morning...though I guess it\'s an effective way to wake up!).  ;-)  Adjustable power levels would make this a 5-star product.  It would also be nice if it had an indicator light that tells you when it\'s fully charged or charging."
2858,2934,20100826,B003UKM90Q,4,"August 26, 2010",ALXFN5BF1H691,Not bad for a cheap rotating brush,"I\'ve used one of Oral-B\'s more upscale models for a while (the 8900 DLX), so I was curious how the value models would do. And it\'s really not too bad for $30.First, you have to realize that if you\'re moving from a normal brush you have to re-learn how to brush. No more moving the brush rapidly with your hand - press the button on the handle and it starts whirling at high speed. Press the brush to your teeth and gums and sloooowly move it left to right or right to left. Make sure you get all three sides of top and bottom, and that you get the gumlines - that\'s the most important part. Obviously it doesn\'t really matter what order you do it in, but if I don\'t keep a pattern I get distracted by pets or people and forget. After two minutes the brush will briefly stop the motor a few times to let you know you\'ve brushed enough - next time you can adjust your movement speed to hit that mark.It includes an induction charger - just set the handle on it. You can do it every night or once a week.So how does this $30 model compare to the $90-120 models? Well, the grip is noticably cheaper, with no rubber grip stripes. The induction charger is very easy to tip over compared to the sturdier \'well\' model. There\'s no charge indicator. The whole thing feels a little bit more flimsy than the 8900, though it never felt like it would actually come apart. There\'s no 30 second indicator like the better models, and there\'s only one speed, though I never found the other speeds on the 8900 useful anyhow.All in all not bad for $30 - of course they\'ll get you for $3-4 each for replacement head, but that\'s only every 3 months or so, and this comes with one head and one spare head. And I think you\'ll do a better job with this than with a regular brush - it\'s very easy to pay for itself if you just get one fewer cavity. If you want one of the above features spring for a better model, but this isn\'t bad for 1/3rd the cost."

At first I didn\'t like the size (read: I wasn\'t used to it), but after brushing with it for a weeks, I realize that I like it better because I can be more precise with my brushing (like with a regular toothbrush)The charger has a small footprint, so it doesn\'t take up too much counter space. It is  also understated so it doesn\'t draw attention to itself.Cons:The attachments (brush, floss brush) can come off or loosen during brushing. If you brush in a wrist-twisting motion like me, you\'ll have to change your brushing style or the tops will keep coming off.It only comes with one brush head. This means that unless you\'re a bachelor, you\'ll need to buy additional heads. I haven\'t looked up the price to these, but that\'s definitely something to consider.There is no cover for the brush heads. This can\'t be too sanitary - especially in a bathroom (dust, hairspray, hand-washing splashes, toilet mist, etc)Final opinion:While I do think this could be a good-value alternative to the costlier sonic toothbrush models, ultimately it\'s hard to say if this unit cleans much better than a manual toothbrush. I still end up brushing my teeth like I did with a regular toothbrush  - the only difference being that this one is vibrating as I go.With questionable benefits and so many shortcomings, I cannot recomend this product."

I have sensitive teeth at the gum line and my dentist said that the \'sonic\' action irritates the sensitivity and to use only once a day (use regular toothbrush on other brushings).  I like using electric toothbrushes because I have forearm and elbow pain from the manual tooth brushing up and down action. Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms. I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  The negative reviews I read seemed like they were isolated instances of the toothbrush going out shortly after purchase, and was not the \'norm.\'  I thought that if I ended up with a \'bad egg\' toothbrush, Amazon would replace easily (as stated in some reviews I read).  I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  And surprisingly, the little \'rubber pieces\' that act as \'floss action\' actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums feel great and look clean after brushing.  Some other bonus items I liked about this product: came with 2 brush heads, so won\'t need to replace heads for at least 6 months; also liked the 2 minute timer alert, but not shutting off so I can finish brushing when I chose to turn it off. I would recommend this toothbrush as a mid-level electric toothbrush, where you don\'t have to buy replacement batteries, yet don\'t value the \'upgrade\' pressure sensing, sonic, covered brush head, multiple handles, etc. of the high-level electric toothbrushes."

On my old Braun electric toothbrushes the head rotated and oscillated, on this toothbrush the head pulsates or vibrates.Is it any better? The shape of the toothbrush head seems better designed to fit the shape or your teeth, and it is larger than the old design, large enough to cover two teeth. But while the head is larger in surface area it is much slimmer in profile so it is much more comfortable to use, it feeling much smaller in the mouth. I also like the timer function, it has an overall two minute timer, but it gives a signal every 15 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth.I like this new toothbrush, it seems as efficient as the old style Braun but is much more comfortable to use, and it is a little quieter too. It is also much easier to clean their being no inner workings as on the old style heads, which I am sure must be much more hygienic too.As the toothbrush should run for a week on a single 14 hour charge it is not necessary to replace the toothbrush on the charger after every use, so the charger does not need to be in the bathroom. Using the toothbrush this way should prolong the the life of the rechargeable battery tooHowever, as yet their does not appear to be an Interspace toothbrush head (which I need to reach awkward spaces) available to fit the toothbrush, so at the moment I am using both the old, with the Interespace head, and the new. Hopefully Braun will produce an Interpsace head for this toothbrush."

I wanted to see if a less expensive electric toothbrush, if it was comparable to the more expensive electric toothrushes, like the one I have been using for years now, and have been very satisfied with.This electric toothbrush doesn\'t have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive electric toothbrush, such as the ability to choose from more than one setting, or a UV sanitizer.I have to say tho that this electric toothbrush made my teeth feel like they were really being scrubbed, so when I was finished using it, my teeth felt very clean.  This electric toothbrush came with 2 brush heads, which seem alittle bigger than the more tapered ones Iam used to using, and this motor seemed to be alittle louder. It actually would slow down, then rev back up.  The automatic timer on this electric toothbrush is supposed to run for 2 minutes, but mine seemed to run for much longer than that, so I went with it.My other electric toothbrush runs for 3 minutes at the setting I use, so I didn\'t mind this.  You always have the option of just turning it off when you want to.I wish this electric toothbrush came with some kind of cover for the toothbrush heads, and some kind of travel case, but for the excellent price of this electric toothrush I can\'t complain.  It does come with a rechargeable stand, which I just leave my electric toothbrush always plugged in, and on the rechargeable stand.  That way it is always ready to use when I need it.I also like that in reading the information that came with this electric toothbrush, that you have like 5 different options for brush heads, depending on the kind you like.  The brush heads seem to be alittle more reasonably priced too, as I always like to buy a minimum of 3 brush heads at a time.  With this electric toothbrush you can even buy them in a quantity of 6, if you want to.  I like to have enough for a year, which they recommend you change your brush head every 3 months, which I agree, so I do that.If you\'ve always wondered if you would like using an electric toothbrush, but didn\'t want to spend the big bucks, you should try this electric toothbrush.  It works very well, at a reasonable price.The major reason to use an electric toothbrush to begin with is to really clean your teeth and gums, which this one seems to do that as well as my more expensive electric toothbrush.Having healthy teeth and gums is so important to your overall health.  Everyone should be able to afford to have an electric toothbrush. I know some of the electric toothbrushes are cost prohibitive, at over $100, but this Oral B electric toothbrush is under $30, much more doable for alot of people.I will continue to use this electric toothbrush, along with the other electric toothbrush I already have.Iam very happy that I was able to try this product, and very satisfied with the results I got."

I replaced it with a more expensive model, but it has served me well. I\'m happy with my purchase as this low price. The brush head rotates back and forth. More expensive rechargeable models will have much more power so they will brush much more efficiently in the same amount of time and they also vibrate. If you are on a budget, you can buy this one, otherwise look at the oral-b professional 1000 (all the models are the same except for extras you don\'t need)."

2618,2681,20100825,B003UKKH6O,4,"August 25, 2010",A3C2CPTCMB7S4N,Better than regular brushing... but I prefer Sonicare,"This is a very compact, well-designed brush and charger.  Upon brushing, it creates a back-and-forth spinning motion and a vibration that is akin to the polishing machine at the dentist\'s office.  There is no doubt that it is superior to traditional brushing in terms of effort to brush and how clean your teeth and mouth feel.  Given the relatively low-price, this could be an excellent option for some.However, I\'m a regular user of the Sonicare (I use the slightly older Elite series), and I can say that I prefer the Sonicare.  After several days of switching back and forth, it was clear to me that the Sonicare is simply better at brushing between teeth and getting the mouth to a clean feeling while being more gentle.  The Oral-B feels more like a polishing experience, whereas the Sonicare seems to get deeper between the teeth and gums and really get things clean.That being said, in reading the literature, it seems that the Oral-B products--at least the Professional Series--are superior to the Sonicare in terms of cleaning plaque (e.g., Biesbrock AR, Walters PA, Bartizek RD, Goyal CR, Qaqish JG. Plaque removal efficacy of an advanced rotation-oscillation power toothbrush versus a new sonic toothbrush. Am J Dent. 2008 Jun;21(3):185-8.).  I found this very interesting.  What I am not sure of, however, is whether or not this lower-priced Vitality line is the same as the more expensive professional series, and if not, how it differs.In sum, this is an excellent electric toothbrush that seems best suited for cleaning the surfaces of teeth extremely well.  I found it to be a little bit rougher and a little less capable of cleaning between the teeth and gums as the Sonicare (which has a larger head, softer bristles, and creates sort of a deep foaming feeling between the teeth).  Still, recommended indeed."

I just started using it and it definitely has some extra power that my old one didn\'t have.  It is a bit loud, so if you have sensitive ears, be warned of that.  It charged fast and is holding its battery power well (I don\'t charge it every time I use it).  I brush for 3 minutes and use the 30 second timers for back, top/bottom, right/left, then the extra minute for my front top and bottom... I thought I would hate the 30 second timer and find it annoying, but turns out its really handy to brush each of the areas long enough.  I haven\'t used the little clock thing as I tend to walk around as I brush, but I imagine it would be good for those adjusting to electric toothbrushes and/or kids.  I also probably won\'t use the extra brush holder as my medicine cabinet doesn\'t have the room.  The travel case will definitely come in handy and the small charger is a nice change from my old clunky one.Pros:*Great clean*30 second pauses and 2 minute longer pause*Small charger*Travel case*Should help your dentist visits!!*Pressure notification (if you are brushing too hard, it gives some warning, but I haven\'t experienced it)*Separate timer would be good for kids or those new to electronic brushesCons:*Louder than my old model*Extra stuff... not sure many people need the brush holder, only some will use the separate timer*New heads are expensive"

Almost all the reviews for the 1000 said the pressure sensor didn\'t work or was innefective. So I ended up getting the Vitality ($24.99) instaed of getting the 5000 ($119-149) that I would not have been as happy with. I spent hours looking for a review that told me this exact info so, you\'re welcome.

I did read some reviews that said the heads wrer a little large, I have a small mouth and while the heads are thicker than a manual brush it was by no means unmanageable or uncomfortable.

They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you\'ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn\'t work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife\'s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you\'re used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I\'m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn\'t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I\'ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I\'m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit."

My first thought...you just want me to buy a $100+ toothbrush that works just as well as my one at home. Of course, like a fish attracted by something shiny I hopped on the internet to take a look at electric toothbrushes. I probably spent 5 hours reading everything I could on these. A lot of people were talking about the one that has a UV cleaner in it. I call gimmick. Anyways, I ended up with this one and was extremely skeptical.1. The timer is separate from the brush and sits on your counter and has a picture of a smiling tooth on it, kind of hard not to feel like this is a joke2. What the heck, charged this puppy up and waited till after dinner3. Initiate brushing sequence4. Having the handle buzz after 30 seconds to let you know to move to a new quadrant and having it show on the timer is very useful. It makes it seem like it is going by really fast.5. If you brush too hard the handle stops pulsating till you back off. I literally put the brush head on each tooth and just move down, not really doing any real brushing but just letting the vibrations do the work.6. After I spit and rinsed out my mouth, it literally felt like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. They stay smooth almost the entire day depending on what you eat.This was $$$ well spent in my opinion. I highly recommend getting one of these.

Really unless you have someone in your family who has different teeth from you, either you will be using the floss or the sensitive, not both, so really it comes with two brushheads, not three.2. It took me a while to read the manual, I didn\'t think it was all that clear on what I was supposed to do (I\'ve never owned one before) but it turns out that it\'s a lot easier than the manual suggests.3. I\'m not certain if the pressure signal works appropriately. After starting to use it, my teeth started to become more sensitive.

Then one day the evil nemesis time took it all away as my Sonic powered toothbrush ceased pulsing its distinctive sound of a million mad mosquitoes.  My wife, as she is wont to do,never wanting anything to do with my inter-spatial toothbrush saw this as the opportunity to finally throw it in the trash. For days it lay in state at the bottom of the can. It was a vision of pure sadness as I knew that now, once again, my elbow must flex and my hand once again must clench the minuscule handle of (gulp)...a manual toothbrush. The thought of losing another energized brush kept me away so for years I maintained only memories of the mad mosquitoes that once blasted calculus to the oblivion. If I had only had that Sonic brush in Mr. Farkner\'s math class, I often thought, perhaps I would have passed. I spoke often to my wife about finding another sonic calculus blaster but this brought only glares. For, as I have previously stated, my wife hated every tiny sonic wave of it\'s tiny brush and nearly forbid it.As I sat in the body conforming chair of my dental hygiene adviser, mirror in hand, viewing my pearly off-whites the bad news came; word by grating word; \'You\'re a lousy brusher\'. These words came from a mouth I could not even see.  Was it true? Is this why she protected her mouth from mine with that veil? For the second time in my life I learned calculus is no fun as she told me I must return for two whole hours of scraping. And it was all my fault. \'This\' she proclaimed after quickly unveiling her mouth \'is an Oral-B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush. and it alone is the answer to your inadequacy\' Wow, it was a mouthful and I was not even sure I could utter that many words without removing the cotton from my cheeks but I still tried. \'A mmmpphh, mmmphh\'. I gave up protesting further only in my mind. \'But it has no sonic drive!\' I though. Seeming to read my thoughts she smiled and curled my fingers around the handle. \'It has modes, lots of modes, and the brush is big, big enough to massage your gums, and who doesn\'t like a gum massage...right?\' I pondered her words as she veiled her mouth again and scraped her way slowly through my calculus problems.As I left her presence, and all the way home on the bus, her words rang in my head. At the first opportunity I searched the World Wide Web for the best price and found a quick trip to the Amazon was in order. I pushed the right buttons and soon it arrived, wrapped incognito in it\'s brown cardboard box with that winky smile. Inside, nestled against it\'s plastic air pillow my new toothbrush rested from it\'s long journey. The air was electric as I pulled it from it\'s packaging and plugged it in. I hung it\'s cordless timer on the wall. I could hardly wait to massage my gums but the book clearly stated I must so I did. When morning came I grabbed the handle. No more clenched fist around a minuscule handle, this baby was large, form fitted to my hand and pulsed with excitement. I pushed the button . The brush came to life. Gone was the sound of a million angry mosquitoes on a mission of blood replaced instead with a sound of raw rotating power. The sound was humanly audible and no longer called dogs from every outside quadrant. At first my elbow still flexed back and forth, as though I were to do the work, but I soon learned I need only relax, position the brush over each tooth and let the Oral-B work. The timer on the wall counted up the seconds. Thirty seconds later the brushed pulsed on and off and I was off to attack a new quadrant.  In just two minutes I was done. The brush had solved my calculus problems for the day and the timer even smiled its approval. Awesome!"

I\'m still not sure how the timer works, either. My only other complaint is that I wish there were a light or something to indicate that the toothbrush is charging. There\'s not.Although the package claims that the toothbrush cleans between teeth, you\'ll definitely still need to floss. I flossed after brushing, and I would say that there was less crud between my teeth than when I use a regular toothbrush, but there was still some (especially the back teeth; there was hardly any in my front teeth).I would definitely recommend this toothbrush, as long as you\'re OK with its intensity.

When you brush you keep the mouth semi-closed and the brush in contact with your teeth at the border with your gums, without pushing too much. This smaller brush allows you to get all around the molars as well. She did not specify the brand but she did say that it is not a matter of price, it is all about how you use it. So you don\'t really need an expensive one. I bought this one because it gets great reviews and the price is very good. I love it! My gums are way better now and she very impressed (well...and I am very impressed as well!). When I went on vacation I brought the regular toothbrush and after a couple of days my gums were all inflamed again. I can\'t leave without it!

From the first brushing, my teeth have felt incredibly smooth and clean, not just after brushing but all day long.  The floss-action brush is really good at cleaning between the teeth, too, as I found out when I manually flossed afterward. Consumer Reports rates this toothbrush (previously called the Oral-B Triumph) very highly, as do user reviews on several websites, and the toothbrush has not disappointed. Check the Oral-B website for a $[...] rebate through June 2010!Included in the box is a pro-white brush (in addition to the floss-action), a charger and covered compartment for the brush heads, a nice travel case for the base, and extra batteries for the smartguide. There is adhesive tape for mounting the smartguide on a wall or mirror, but the smartguide sits nicely on the bathroom counter as well. I like the smartguide and its dual function as a bathroom clock. Very cool. It also keeps me on track as I brush.As other reviewers have noted, the battery cover on the smartguide is somewhat difficult to remove, and you have to take it off to access the buttons to set the clock. The plug on the charger is also rather large and takes up a chunk of space on the bathroom counter.  These are small annoyances, though.

526,537,20100105,B0002KHU3I,4,"January 5, 2010",A1P948LMDI28W4,Great product though not perfect,"Being an engineer, I did extensive research before buying an \'automatic\' toothbrush, and wound up selecting the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  The Oral-B has one huge benefit over the SoniCare I was considering and that was the rotary action since the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750 also has \'sonic\' pulsations.  A lower-end Oral-B had the dual-action brushes, but wasn\'t \'sonic\'.  Did a bit more research on the Oral-B website and found this dual-action brush head to be compatible with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  This was just another huge advantage of the Oral-B over the SoniCare automatic toothbrush.  Since these dual-action toothbrushes weren\'t too expensive, I took a gamble and brought three 3-packs.  This was about 4-months ago, and I\'m still using the first one from my purchase.I definitely felt a cleaner difference from the dual-action brush head than the rotating brush head that came with my Oral-B.  The lateral vibrating brush not only help loosen gunk from your teeth, it also provides the surface area for the toothpaste, and an additional \'sonic\' surface.  With just the rotating brush head, I generally cannot finish brushing within the two-minute recommended brushing time and take at least 4 minutes.  With the dual-action brush head, I\'m able to do it in 2-minutes and my mouth feels much cleaner.  And my teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter.  I had cavity filings that were colored to match my yellowish teeth, and now I can clearly see that my teeth are a much whiter shade than my filings.  (This was without change in toothpaste, and actually reduced time in brushing).So what can be improved?  Three things.  One is the dual-action brush head is a bit thick, although not much thicker than the regular rotary brush heads.  Would be nice to have a flatter profile.  Second is that flossing action bristles should come on the rotary part of the dual-action brush head (like that on the rotary brush that came with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750).  And third, and the most important, is that the rotary part and the lateral vibrating parts of the dual-action brush head should be angled about 10 degrees to contour fit the curve of one\'s teeth.  This will optimize the contact surface at any time we\'re gliding the brush during brushing.  With these improvements, I would give it 5-stars... food-for-thought for any Oral-B employees reading this."

My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why. Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:- practically no assembly required, it\'s ready to go out of the box- comes with a deck for the charger and slots for 4 heads. Storing the head keeps it cleaner, and you can use this brush for the entire family - just get different color heads and you\'re set.- all you have to do is move the brush around, no pressure needed. In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.- the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles- I love how sensitive the power button is. With CrossAction, I had to jam the button to get the brush going. With the 3000, you literally just tap it.- the brush takes about 17 hours to charge fully, and last for a week. However, I just keep it on the charger all the time since you can\'t overcharge it.The only thing that I\'m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space. Other than that, this brush is perfection!"

Sometimes they lasted a while, but like other people have said they felt loose.  Then one by one, they would break, sometimes even while in my mouth.  I honestly thought it was just something wrong with my toothbruth.  I figured it was just a little off and causing damage to the heads.  So this weekend I began to look into buying a new toothbruth when I came across all the articles about the fake brushheads.  Sure enough, the descriptions of the fake merchandise matched what I had.  So I\'ve been using fake heads for a year.  I contacted Amazon and after 30 minutes and having to speak to the manager they refunded only the ones bought directly from Amazon.  They said since I had purchased them so long ago this was a \'special exception\' they were making for me.  I don\'t even really care about the money so much as I care about taking responsibility for it.  Amazon should be at least somewhere responsible for the quality of their products and even of the resellers.  Refunding or contacting the reseller is the least they can do in my opinion.  The manager has forwarded my story to the inventory department and if I receive a call back I will update here.  Thanks everyone.Update: I haven\'t heard yet from Amazon, but I called Oral B.  They took this much more seriously.  At Amazon I got the feeling they thought I was scamming them, but Oral B took all my information, refunded me, and is looking into it.  Like I said I didn\'t really care about the money, but rather that I\'ve been using fake brushheads for a year and the fact that it still seems like Amazon is selling them.  Who knows if I was damaging my teeth...."

Even on the gentlest settings, it made my teeth vibrate in an uncomfortable way.Years ago I wrote an article comparing different toothbrushes and toothpastes. I asked several dentists if they had any preferences. One thing I was told by two dentists is that electric toothbrushes are bad, because people tend to brush too hard when using them, ruining the protective enamel on their teeth.Well, I like to judge things for myself, so I did get one, an Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush. And I like it. I\'m careful not to press down too hard when I use it, and I don\'t believe it\'s harming my teeth. I\'m not as confident about that with the Pulsonic. I also prefer the battery-operated Advance over something that takes up more space around the sink and takes up an outlet. I get compliments for how white my teeth are, and I think the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is partly responsible.The Pulsonic is probably a better toothbrush, but considering the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is just $14.99 and does the job for me, I can\'t say it\'s worth the difference."
2831,2906,20101030,B003UKM90Q,5,"October 30, 2010",A43WCF8W3GM8Z,Easy. Simple. Good.,"Opening the clamshell package is tougher than use of this toothbrush.  Really.  That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that\'s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it\'s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you\'ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It\'s not like they\'ll go stale in the linen closet.Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.Hints:Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you\'re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you\'re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you\'ll do a serious \'eewwww.\'  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.  This is important.Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger. This will make that weekend maintenance simpler.That\'s it! Now get one for yourself and see."

Like the Smart Guide/Clock timer because I used to walk around the house for the two minutes until the pulse timer went off so I never knew if I was missing spots - now I stay pretty much on track. It is a little confusing at first but it\'s not really difficult to use. I\'m not exactly a rocket scientist so if I can do it anyone can.  There are a number of things that you have to learn and get used to and decide what the most comfortable settings are for you.  I will get a couple of the recommended brushes, especially the \'floss\' brush.  They are fairly expensive but I think they last a long time.  The unit is a tad heavy in comparison to my old Oral B, but it didn\'t take long to get use to.  I think my teeth look brighter and feel cleaner than with any other brush I\'ve ever used.

Better than sonicare essence,This simple cheap battery operated oral b toothbrush cleans really well and the batteries last a long time! I bought this electric toothbrush along with a sonicare essence brush that my dentist recommended. I noticed that if I took a toothpick to my teeth after using the sonicare I could still scrape off plaque. I could find no plaque after using the oral b and my teeth felt cleaner and smoother. My sonicare now sits in the closet and I use this brush exclusively. Doesn\'t hurt the gums either nor jar the teeth with high vibrations.I noticed a few people have remarked that getting the battery cap off is difficult. The trick is to squeeze inward on the sides with some strength first and then pull off. Don\'t pull off when you are just starting to squeeze inward.

At first, this veteran user of the EB17 Flexisoft head was a bit skeptical. But after a few days use, I have a new favorite.The dual-brush head is a bit bigger than the traditional round head. The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars. But this head is great for quickie between meal cleaning, and as a bonus is pretty good at brushing off my tongue.This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure. Since EB17s usually run about $5 per head in 3-, 4-, and 6-packs, finding the EB417 about the same price is a relief. You really DO want to replace heads every few months, after the outer blue bristles fade half-way down."

The problem with Sonicare was durability (that was less than 2 years on average) and high cost. But I should say that when (once) it died during first year, it took one phone call to get replacement.Oral-B looked better per reviews and also it had cheaper replacement heads. So, we decided to give a try.As a toothbrush, it works differently from Sonicare and at the beginning we liked it quite more. But after a while, I\'m not sure which one I like more. In either case, it does job done. I would not suggest buying the fancy timer though.However, this one died in a half a year. By itself, one sample is not a statistic. But customer support was quite less friendly and we had to ship the toothbrush with papers for \'repair\'. At the end, we\'ve got a new one - but is was much more painful.Bottom line: I would rate the toothbrush about the same as Sonicare, quite worth customer support and (so far) same poor reliability. If this one will die within next year or two, I probably will switch back to Phillips."

I decided to spend a little more money for more features and I\'m really happy with the 3000 Professional.

The pressure sensor works but I don\'t know that I\'d ever push hard enough to actually turn it on in use.The minor thing that I don\'t need is the stand accessory which has the holders for additional brush heads.  This could probably be useful for a family that shares a toothbrush and simply swaps heads.  I knew what I was ordering though and that\'s why I\'m still giving it 5 stars.

So I spent about 40 minutes at the grocery store agonizing over my choice, and finally picked the Vitality due to its reasonable cost and the included replacement head. So far I really like it for getting my teeth clean without my feeling like I have to scrub. I notice I don\'t put near as much pressure on my teeth and gums as I used to. I still may switch to the sensitive heads, though, as my gums feel a little worn after brushing. I like the timer too.The only things I wish could be improved are the packaging (I almost cut my hand off removing the brush!) and the lack of a charger light. Otherwise I think this is a good buy and am looking forward to good report at my next dentist appointment.**UPDATE:**I did switch to the sensitive head and I like that better. My teeth still feel clean, and the brush is much gentler. I would advise the sensitive brush if you tend to use too much pressure when brushing.Also wanted to note that the instruction sheet is very thorough and gives good information on how to use the brush and how to tell if you\'re brushing too hard."

The stupid timer thing is a waste of plastic and will probably end up in the trash.  It\'s useless and not a smart solution.  It waste battery and it\'s bulky.  Sonicare brushes just beeps and stops for a split second to tell you to move to the next quadrant (it\'s built into the toothbrush).  Also, this thing seems to just rotate and didn\'t do too well between the gap of your tooth.  With sonicare, it just sorta melts it was or the bubbles extract the stuff out.If you insist on this type of brush, buy the 4000 version...even if the 5000 is cheaper (which is not)...because it\'ll save having to buy batteries or waste the planet\'s resource.Again, I hate waste, stupid design, gimmicks.I want to see someone else support me on this.

All I used was the floss action brush head.After using the Oral B continually for about 3 months, I can say that the (oral B) delivers a much more powerful clean. Though the Sonicare was easier to reach the back teeth.  Both delivers a clean, smooth just left the dentist feeling.This thing is way thicker then my old Sonicare E series handle, the pictures on amazon don\'t show the side shots.  And compared to the latest and greatest sonicare, it\'s probably double the thickness.  Go to your local retail store to compare, if thin is in for you.The smartguide clock thing is pretty heavy and thick as well, keep that in mind if you want to find some way of wall mounting it.  If you have it free standing on your sink its hard to read unless your eye level (I\'m 6 3) or stand back a foot or two.  And , although some of the back is rubberized, it won\'t lean against your wall without falling.  I use fun tack to overcome this.  It comes with two sets of AA batteries, which was pretty worrysome to me because most companies don\'t even give one set but it is still going strong.  It\'s neat to know how far in you\'ve brushed and when to switch quadrants, and the \'studder\' helps better then the audible sound the sonicare makes. Smartguide will count up and down for you.Brush heads seems much cheaper then my sonicare.  A 6 pack in my local warehouse club costs $30.  About $15 for a 3 pk on Amazon, and even cheaper with subscribe and save.It charges a bit quicker then my sonicare.  The charger base is really tiny, takes up very little room.  It even snaps into the included 4 user toothbrush tray.  However, even when it\'s done charging the wall wart (power brick thing) stays slightly warm (warmth=energy consumption), so I\'d advise you to unplug after charging.."

I find I brush longer now and pay more attention to each area because I know I will be reminded when it is time to change areas.  I have used a smaller toothbrush for years and found this one to be a perfect size brush as well as the handle is not that much bigger than a manual toothbrush.  The only thing that I don\'t love is the cord is in the base - not detachable so the base needs a larger space to accomidate the cord.

Some items to note of my fakes:- Had the right packaging, but it printing was blurry on the back. It\'s hard to tell from the picture, but the text and graphics were noticeably fuzzy.- The logo did not scratch-off and there was an engraved serial number- The package only had 1 ring- Bristles were noticeably sloppy, particularly when compared to the real thing- There was blue dye leaking onto the yellow pieceOverall, these fakes were slightly better than some of the previous fakes people posted, but still fake nonetheless."

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  This particular item is three heads.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads.  You can find them for much less than $10/head, which is the price of this listing."

I got a set of sensitive heads because I have sensitive gums and never tried the other heads.  I like the sensitive heads.  Between flossing and brushing with this thing, my teeth feel almost as clean as walking out of a dentist office.  I used to see plaque build-up between visits behind my lower incisors.  This brush manages to clean that plaque away.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  In the past, I\'d occasionally see bleeding gums while flossing.  I haven\'t seen that recently.The toothbrush felt funny to use at first.  My teeth felt like they were \'buzzing\' a little after brushing.  I don\'t notice that any more.  The handle feels bulky, but I\'m able to maneuver it fine now and I can certainly clean more tooth surfaces with this brush than my old non-electric brush.  What\'s nice is that you simply have to position the brush properly and it vibrates to perform the cleaning.  I like the wireless timer that guides me through brushing 30 seconds in each quadrant.Set-up could have been easier.  Instructions were so-so and removing the back cover of the clock/timer was more difficult than it should have been.  But, day-to-day use is easy and rewarding.After using for 6 months, the wireless display became very finicky over batteries.  It goes haywire if the battery isn\'t fully charged.  The first set of batteries lasted 6 months.  I replaced with fresh energizers; they lasted only two months.  I checked the energizers with my multimeter and they register solidly in the \'good\' range---the batteries are fine."

We really, really  like the smaller brush head which seems to  be able to clean teeth in  places that a longer, straight brush does not.  Our  older  straight brush seemed to coast  along the front while this brush gets into crevices.  Neither of us is sure that we\'ve ever had a problem because of brushing too hard.  Nonetheless, the warning light for that is a nice safety factor.  High on our  list of positives are the brush head indicator  bristles that let us  know when to change the brush head.  That\'s one thing that we\'ve been unsure of and procrastinated about in the past.  Sorry to say that our teeth don\'t appear to be any whiter so we continue to use the Crest strips."

Because of this I\'ve used the old fashioned manual brushes that did a reasonable job of keeping my teeth clean. Well, this tradition is about to change.After using this brush, my teeth have a smooth and polished feel all the way down to just below the gum line! Amazing! Even my manual brushes don\'t do as thorough a job. Also, the brush charges through induction which means that it\'s waterproof and has no wires or metal contact points that need to be protected from water. This is very cool.I could only find one minor downside to this brush which is that the head is somewhat thick. What I mean is that the distance between the bristle tips and back of the head makes it necessary for me to open my mouth fairly wide  to get the brush the tops of my rear molars. This isn\'t a challenge for me but it might be for someone with a smaller mouth.I guess I can summarize my review by saying that I\'m tossing out my manual brushes because this is now my personal favorite.

Getting the back teeth is tricky for him, and when we take over to \'do finishing touches,\' we\'d always end up bonking him on the teeth/ gums/ lips with part of this toothbrush. This made him mad, and when you are trying to convince a toddler that toothbrushing is fun, you do not want to make him mad.2. The brush head is not replaceable. So once the bristles are worn, you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one. Sure, the purchase price is cheap, but like so many things, that is not the \'real cost,\' once you factor in how many you\'ll have to buy and how many you put in the landfill.

So goes my old fashioned \'manual\' toothbrush for a newfangled electric model. Okay, so I am not so old that I actually talk that way, but sometimes change is hard.As this is my first powered toothbrush, I cannot offer any comparison to models of old, but I can tell you that using the Oral-b 3000 is surely a different experience from just plain old brushing. First off, the round head shape definitely seems to do a great job of cleaning teeth; its shape allows for the bristles to envelope the tooth and I can feel its cleaning efforts at work. And, for those of you who have a tendency to scour their teeth with a toothbrush and scrape off the enamel, the Oral-b 3000 comes with a pressure sensor that will warn you when you are using too much force.Overall, my mouth feels cleaner after just a few days of use and I can tell it will likely make a difference in my dental hygiene.Something to note... If you have a high fear of dentists and their tools, then you should be aware that using the Oral-b 3000 will sound like you are in the dentist\'s chair. Nothing to fear, but it is a little shocking for the unprepared."

The Oral-B Pulsonic was my first venture into the higher end toothbrushes and I must say it is very nice.  Let me first say I am not big on reading directions on most products before I try them out.  So, after a few days of brushing, I went to the directions to see why my new toothbrush kept pausing or hesitating after a couple minutes of brushing.  Low and behold, it\'s a feature designed to let you know it\'s time to move on to another part of your mouth...very nice.The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.  The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  I have found the button placement may not be located at the best spot for some people.  While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  The brush is thinner than other brushes I have used.  I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  Also, the brush head is much smaller with fewer frills than other sonic brushes I have tried.Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.  I cannot say if this toothbrush out pulses the competition or does a better job of cleaning, but compared to the previous brushes I have tried this one is twice the price.  In my opinion, this is a great toothbrush.  It all comes down to personal preference."

This toothbrush is far superior to regular brushing.  Your teeth feel so clean afterwards.  I recommend using this product fully and then trying the FlossAction head.  The flossaction just seems to massage my gums and clean a notch better!  Also, each head has bristles with indicators but sometimes it\'s hard to tell when to replace the heads.  Just replace them every 6-8 weeks.  Also, the unit cleans so much better with the battery full rather than low.

The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  The brushing unit is waterproof so no worry about getting water or moisture on it. There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush. The unit uses a rechargeable battery, which the company claims can not be over charged, so you can store the brushing unit on the electric charger unit.I have used both a Phillips and Oral-B electric toothbrush and find that this rechargeable model does a comparable job in the cleaning of my teeth. I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back teeth.The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth. The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums. The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off. The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.The brushing bristles give an indication by fading in color to show when it should be replaced. I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package. Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long but it looks very similar to the brushing head I have used on my Oral-B electric toothbrush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model."

I got it about a year ago from my dentist\'s office, and absolutely love it.  The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...the savings is very significant!).I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn\'t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it\'s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren\'t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don\'t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)"

The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days.  3 days is the new norm. That\'s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger.  It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference.  After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it\'s smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."

I also like it that the set includes the tiny brush for cleaning between teeth too! I would say this is a little pricey at $20, which averages out to about $5 per brush, but it was worth it to have them so I wouldn\'t have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush--and a brush, I might add, that is my all-time favorite, especially since it has the \'sensitive\' teeth speed.

The toothbrush came with 2 heads, and it took a while to charge (I didn\'t see the battery light at first so I was worried). I suggest you allow it to charge over night and use it first thing in the morning. Definitely takes a bit to get used to, and some practice (hurts when the back of the head hits your teeth).

The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth.  The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design.  It was worth trying and I\'m not disappointed but will probably be going back to the easier to maneuver regular version next time.

I prefer the oral-b / braun non-sonic over the sonic models. I am a big fan of this style of toothbrush & have owned them for almost two decades. I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years) and this one is my favorite. The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \'brake light\' which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums. Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \'get all up in there\', but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful. I buy the \'extra sensitive\' heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I\'m not \'paying attention\'. Even though the other models had an \'indicator\' (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn\'t really enough to get my attention so I didn\'t reduce the pressure.When I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light - it\'s *really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall. (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom). But, the \'brake light\' was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and the light now only goes on every once in a while.They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing. This toothbrush with its \'brake light\' feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums & your teeth, and in turn, your health & well-being!PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, & healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon). I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)"

The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  I can\'t comment on the alleged \'flossing action\' since I still floss and I\'m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven\'t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  The things we do for oral hygiene.So yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B\'s Vitality.  That\'s just your teeth and gums howling like Westley from The Princess Bride being tortured.  Well, your teeth and gums are wimps.  They\'ll get used to it and thank you later.  Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you\'ve just had a professional cleaning.  The secret, of course is the much-vaunted circular buffing motion.  You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  Problem solved.  Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there\'s not a lot to complain about.  If you\'ve got the bucks and a hankering for oral hygiene, then you could surely do worse than to invest in Vitality."

He got out of his car, came up to my window, and asked me for my license and registration. As I gave it to him, I looked up and flashed him one of those Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) clean smiles. It just so happened that he was a user too. He instantly realized, gave me a nod and a wink, and ripped up my ticket. Thanks, Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

(There are 2 brush heads included int he box.)  I don\'t really like to use it to brush my tongue so I still keep my old toothbrush on hand for that purpose.  The unit has never run out of power on us and works today just as well as it did we we received it.  If you don\'t care for the large dual clean brush heads (they are a little big) you can use any of the other heads that Oral-B manufactures.
2265,2317,20101128,B002HWS9GG,1,"November 28, 2010",A254GK1CC24ZY2,Awesome toothbrush! Crappy Amazon Customer Service,"NOTE: The product is actually 5 stars but I\'m giving this review 1 star for Customer Service. I figured if it was 1 star... perhaps, Amazon checks the reviews and will read this! HUMPH!Regarding the product, 5 STARSI\'ve used the Sonicare E Series for years (probably almost a decade by now). I somehow managed to get periodontal gum disease about 3 years ago. My dentist found no physical cause for this (as I\'m young, do take care of my teeth and gums, and my medical exams/blood tests have all turned up fine). Anyways, after brushing my teeth with the Sonicare, I usually still see visible plague (sticky white residue) on some of my teeth/gums... no matter how much I aim the toothbrush at my gums, etc. Also, since my mouth is small, I always feel that the toothbrush doesn\'t really get the back of my four top front teeth (central & lateral incisors), due to the shape of the toothbrush. My hygienist has always favored Oral B for its smaller shape but I always thought Sonicare was the best that was out there. Anyways, I decided to switch over since our Sonicare was dying and Oral B had a 50% off promotional rebate. Sweet deal!!! After the very first use of this Oral B toothbrush, I didn\'t see any visible plaque! My next dentist appt. is in Feb., so I\'m extremely curious to see if my dentist and hygienist notices any improvements!Regarding Amazon\'s Customer Service, 1 STAR and that star is for the CS Agent #4 that assisted me (He/she really gets 5 stars... all other CS Agents get 0 stars!)So, Oral B\'s website clearly stated that the 50% off promotional rebate was valid for purchases from Sept. 1st through Nov. 30th. It also stated: \'participating online retailers will provide a printable rebate form with purchase\' and listed Amazon as a participating online retailer. However, the \'rebate forms for recent purchases\' link (at the top of Amazon\'s product description) provided us with a PDF link to an older rebate (valid for purchases by Oct. 31st). Also, when we clicked on the \'instructions\' link and followed the steps to see if any of our purchases qualified for a rebate, it came back saying that our Oral B purchase didn\'t qualify for any rebates. (We decided to go this route before contacting CS in the hopes that we could obtain the correct rebate through a different method on Amazon\'s website.)So, I contacted Amazon\'s CS via chat, tell them my problem, provided the links to Amazon\'s product page and Oral B\'s product page (for their reference) and requested that they send me the new and/or correct rebate form. Here goes my frustration:- CS Agent #1: Reads my message, puts me on hold to research, comes back and tells me that my problem is that the rebate was for purchases made by Oct. 31st and I didn\'t qualify since I purchased the product in Nov. DUH! I KNOW THAT! I proceed to resend him the link to Oral B\'s site that clearly stated the new promotion and that Amazon was a participating online retailer. CS Agent #1 tells me \'We support a wide range of mail-in offers, but this particular offer is a transaction between you and the manufacturer. If you need more help with the offer, I recommend contacting Oral B directly.\' Great. Useless. I asked for a phone number so that I could speak with someone and was provided with an Amazon CS phone number.- Called and spoke with CS Agent #2: Explained my problem, stated that CS Agent #1 was not helpful and if he could please assist. I also explained that CS Agent #1 was not aware of the new promotion, etc. etc. I was again placed on hold while he researched the issue and he also came back with the same line, \'that I purchased the product outside of the promotional offer.\' CS Agent #2 did not have internet access so I requested that he transfer me to a manager that had internet access and could see what Oral B\'s site stated.- Transferred to CS Agent #3 (who was a regional manager): He said that he was sorry that Amazon\'s website stated one thing while Oral B\'s site stated another. He can only submit my request to Amazon\'s marketing team and that they should hopefully send me the correct rebate on Monday (as I had called on a Sunday and Marketing was closed).During all this time (that I was on the phone), I was again on Amazon chat with yet another CS Agent... I figured... I must somehow be able to reach someone that understands and can assist!- CS Agent #4: I explained that I had already spoken to several people, explained my situation and asked that he/she kindly please research the links that I\'m sending before he/she comes back to tell me that I purchased outside of the qualifying promotional period. CS Agent #4 comes back and saves the day! Apparently, if you scroll further down the product page on Amazon, under \'Special Offers & Product Promotions\', is yet another rebate link... this time to the CORRECT FREAKING REBATE! YES! YES! YES! I was so thrilled that I thanked CS Agent #4 profusely. I also asked CS Agent #4 to tell the Amazon web team that the link at the top of the page refers to the old rebate, which is confusing when there\'s another link further down that refers to the new rebate.So, yes, I missed the second rebate link on the product page... but so did the first 3 Amazon CS reps! It took 4 tries to get someone competent to assist me.I also think it\'s pretty incompetent of Amazon\'s web team to 1) Not have the two rebates listed together under the same section... why have multiple rebates available on different parts of the page? And 2) when checking to see if your purchase qualified for any rebates (although a cool feature) was definitely useless in my case as it didn\'t register the fact that the Oral B toothbrush did indeed qualify for a rebate (that was apparently available after all on their website)!Phooey on Amazon for their customer service and web team.Other than this frustrating experience, I do enjoy shopping on Amazon.com... I guess it is safe and hassle free... as long as you don\'t require a rebate or customer service!"

1235,1263,20120426,B000LSUW6S,1,"April 26, 2012",A19AMHKQJT8IOJ,FAKE,This was NOT an oral B product as advertised. Bristles feel out in my mouth on first use and the color indicators never worked. Will NOT buy from this seller again.
1561,1599,20090114,B001CX4JSS,2,"January 14, 2009",A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,Good Product Except for the Fatal Flaw,"I was encouraged when I received this toothbrush.  Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife\'s mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a \'clean\' mode and a \'sensitive\' mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars."

Comes with a charging base with no metal contacts so you don\'t have to worry about getting the toothbrush itself wet. The heads cam get a little funky if you don\'t rinse them thoroughly, and so can the base if you don\'t dry the machine, but those stew basically my only issues. Love this brush, will definitely get another when this one dies (the battery is not user-replaceable)."

It\'s not that I didn\'t brush after every meal when I was doing it manually; it\'s that these toothbrushes do a significantly better job. Furthermore, although their use has never actually whitened my teeth, it slows down the degree of stain accumulation from tea, coffee, etc., so that I do not have to bleach my teeth as often.Having said all that: This model does not work any better than my trusty Oral-B S-200. It also has the same drawback, that the rechargeable batteries do not last forever and when they give out, you must buy a whole new unit. When in use, the toothbrush sounds louder than the S-200 and different, resembling a dentist\'s drill.  For anyone thinking of using older heads they have around, my S-200 heads do not fit on this model--the shaft is different. The brushes themselves are round instead of the traditional oval--I can\'t see any advantage to that but perhaps a dentist can.Is this toothbrush worth using?  Absolutely. Is it the best value in an electric toothbrush?  Perhaps not."

Teeth feel better than ever before.  We brush longer than before and it\'s actually enjoyable.

2107,2156,20110430,B002HWS9GG,2,"April 30, 2011",A2QW3PJLLN59NW,Didn\'t even last 3 months,"I have to say that this model is a little less powerful than a previous model of Oral B electric toothbrush that I replaced after over 5 years of multiple daily use. After about 2 weeks, the battery display started to develop moisture within the display. At around one month, the display could no longer be seen since condensation had turned into large water globules that obstructed the display.With 4 uses per day by two adults, after 3.5 months, the toothbrush failed to turn on but would activate after a few minutes or sometime in the day by itself. It is apparent that the board has gone bad and the toothbrush is no longer useable reliably.Pros:This toothbrush has a holding stand that can hold up to four individual heads for multiple users, or different toothbrush heads. (Be sure to dry your toothbrush head before placing in case, or you will have a gradual soap scum build up)Multiple Settings for persons with sensitive teeth.Timer that displays vibrations by 30 second intervals for dentistry recommended minimum of 30 seconds per quadrant.Timer also displays time. (Would like to have had the timer lit since the angle is almost at 90 degrees and should be angled slightly higher by about 15 degrees more for adult use.)Cons:The price is high for what seems to be only a timer radio frequency linked display and a few lower setting for strength of brushDid not last long for something that is exposed to soap in mouth and running water when rinsedPower connection is very l;arge and takes up a lot of spaceaway from the electrical socket. (MOst people are limited to counter space in the bathroom)In conclusion, I liked the design and feel of the toothbrush but was very dissapointed that it broke on me after only a few months. A little red light displays on the timer to show if you are being to rough on your tooth enamel when brushing, which I liked but also wanted the motor to be as powerful as previous models. Maybe this was bad for my teeth, but I could feel the difference on the gum lining of each tooth when touching sliding my tongue for cleanliness.since some people have a hard time returning things, maybe this one should be bought in a store with a guaranty instead of online. I will try to contact Oral B and Amazon about a replacement, and will update this review upon their response with difficulty or ease."

She\'s quite happy with it, and was pleased to discover that the batteries and head were both replaceable. As for my own experience with it, I prefer the Sonicare-style brush head; this one has a particularly thicker post, which combined with the odd channels in it seem to make for a fair amount of drooling while I brush. Not exactly a big deal, but certainly not what I\'d like to use for everyday brushing. Still, it\'s an excellent value for the price."

I am not the most dedicated of flossers but this electric toothbrush with it\'s Floss Action head does the trick.  The bristles are firm and get between the teeth to remove that heavy plague and gumlines.  I am not advocating this as s DEEP cleanser for that you probably need one of those electric at home Waterpik\'s, but this is the next best and cheapest alternative.While I am not big on rechargeable electric toothbrushes because I believe they are a bit passe, I won\'t discount this brush for being that, and matter of fact the rechargeable unit is not big and clunky as they use to be 10 years ago.

We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist\'s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn\'t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn\'t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don\'t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn\'t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth."

I gave the Floss Action heads a try using the Oral B Vitality motor unit and thought the Floss Action heads weren\'t very good. About a year later, I put the same Floss Action head on an Oral B Smart Series 5000 and it was totally different. I\'d definitely buy the Floss Action heads in the future.The Floss Action heads are similar to the standard Precision heads, but have 4 extra rubber paddles for \'flossing action\'  or removing some stains. With the Vitality brush, the RPMs weren\'t fast enough or the oscillating action was slightly off causing the Floss Action heads to hurt my gums a little. They acted more like bumpers than anything else. With the Oral B 5000, the RPM seemed faster and smoother, and the Floss Action heads felt the same as the Precision heads.I normally floss before brushing, so I cannot comment on whether the Floss Action heads can replace the act of flossing. I still recommend following your hygienist\'s recommendations, which is usually to floss before brushing.It works well at cleaning my teeth, and it is compatible with most Oral B brush motors. However, I recommend you buy an updated unit and not try to use the Floss Action on a Vitality, low-end model, or something made a decade ago. The 4 extra paddles don\'t feel like they\'re doing anything, but I can see them oscillating on my teeth and gums.Overall: 4/5 stars"

While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.ADVANTAGES:Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It\'s not the most powerful brush I\'ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.DISADVANTAGES:Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it\'s nice to have the option and this one does not.Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it\'s power would rate 3 stars.OTHER COMMENTS:Does it whiten teeth?  It\'s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.  I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me."

2673,2742,20100827,B003UKKHB4,4,"August 27, 2010",AL5OEDM8TPTKV,My First Experience...,"... with an electric toothbrush. I\'d been considering trying out an electric toothbrush for a couple years now, after issues with gingivitis. However, the expense of a unit deterred me from purchasing one. The Oral-b 3000 is a sturdy unit, easy to use, and in a word of a novice user, quite a bizarre experience.To move from manually brushing your teeth to an electric brush requires a period of adjustment. The unit is very easy to use, and comes with features that make decisions about brushing teeth easier. For example, the unit recommends brushing each side of the mouth for thirty seconds; thirty seconds for upper left, thirty seconds for lower left. The unit actually pulsates at you when its time to switch, so little thought is required.Another feature I appreciate is that if you apply too much pressure to the brush, the unit will let you know by slowing down. It\'s a feature designed to protect the tooth from hard waring action. I do appreciate that.The bizarreness of the experience is the actual brushing. The sensation of whirring against my teeth immediately transported myself to my dentist\'s chair (never a pleasant time, in my opinion). Perhaps it was the sound as well. The sensation of a pulsating unit in my mouth brought up images of drills, and cavities; not all together pleasant.One drawback is already mentioned in another review. When the unit\'s rechargable batteries die, so do the unit. I\'m not sure how long they will last, but I would have to ask myself, would I spend money on another electric toothbrush when this one dies? At this point I cannot say for sure. I need to give the unit time to see if it is effective, and I\'ll know more from my dental hygeinist after my next dental appointment."

By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations. Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.Looks and size: nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).I would recommend this product to my family and friends."

Once we completed the purchase and went to fill out the form, we then discovered that the rebate was only applicable to one toothbrush, despite our purchasing two on the same order. After calling the customer service number, we were told we are S.O.L. on getting the rebate for both, and there is no way to \'contact the seller\' about this.Thus we have taken to the always useful Comments section to air our grievance; We are Prime members, buy a lot of products on Amazon, and feel like Amazon should definitely do better.The toothbrushes do work great though, and despite our now degraded opinion of Amazon rebates etc, we are happy with the product so far."

That\'s one big advantage of the Oral B -- you can buy different heads to use for different purposes. The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.My only complaint is that there\'s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it\'s fully charged or when the charge is low. It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors. When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working.

My favorite brush is now free and easy without need of a charging stand. This product is exactly what I expected and wanted, so I have no complaints. And the price is just a steal!Just a word about brush heads. There are various options for Oral-B, but basically two main ones: Precision Clean and Dual Clean. Precision Clean only has the round group of bristles at the tip of the brush. The correct way to use this brush head is to run it slowly over each tooth. This cleans very thoroughly. For people who aren\'t comfortable changing the technique they\'re accustomed to with non-powered toothbrushes, there is the Dual Clean. This brush head has an extra group of bristles that allows you (if you want) to use the Oral-B more like a regular non-powered toothbrush."

I brook down and bought the version with the SmartGuide. My thought was what the heck even though I thought I did not require it. I have say that there have been times when I would have stopped brushing before 2 minutes are up because I thought 2 minutes had gone by. Note that the toothbrush pulsates every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants and pulsates three times at the two minute mark, so you don\'t really need the SmartGuide. It is still nice to check while brushing and the clock is a nice feature as well. For Christmas I got my wife the same toothbrush, but it now seems to be called the 5000. I have to say it is hard to figure out all the models and sets Oral-B creates. I told my wife that when you first use the toothbrush you will feel as if your teeth are going to shake right out of your mouth and she agreed. After a couple of uses, you become totally use to the brush. I have read negative reviews in which people stated this toothbrush makes their gums bleed, I can only assume they have gum problems and brushing action was too much for their gums. Without a doubt my teeth are much cleaner with this brush. I am not always good about flossing, and I would notice that when I got around to flossing again after period of not flossing that my gums were sore the following day. I noticed tarter build up as well. With the Triumph/5000, I never notice these problems now. Of course this toothbrush is not a substitute for not flossing, but I feel it really helps if you don\'t always floss. Our kids have now used our toothbrushes as well for the last few months and most importantly they are brushing for a full two minutes. Prior to this my son was closer to bushing for 10 seconds than 2 minutes. I figured too that the newness of the brush would have worn off with them, but they still seem to like it. Battery life is good as well. I get about 11 days between charges, but I also brush between 2.5 minutes and 3 minutes every time I brush. With that factored in I would say a 2 minute brusher would get pretty close to 2 weeks on a charge. Bottom line is this is a great product. So much so that I hauled it with me on an 8-day trip to Europe, and it went in my backpack not my checked luggage. I still take a manual toothbrush on overnight trips, but I sure hate not having this toothbrush with me."

My dentist has told me that I need to floss regularly since my gums are receding.  This toothbrush a little louder than I expected, but remember this is my first power toothbrush.  I really like the two minute timer feature becuase my dentist always told me that I was always \'over\' brushing.  Since brushing with an up and down movement can wear off the enamel (as told by my dentist), the Oral-B toothbrush uses oscillating and rotating movement which dentists prefer.  The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited warranty.Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.

We own two, rechargeable, Oral B toothbrush bases and each child and I has our own brushhead that simply snaps on and off.In comparison to brushing with a manual toothbrush, the Oral B electric toothbrush is a far superior brushing solution. You can\'t really compare manual brushing to an Oral B anymore than you can compare a bike to a car.  A bike will get you there, but not as quickly or comfortably as a car. The oral B accesses harder to reach areas of your mouth easier than a manual toothbrush, and the brush spins much faster than you could ever hope to brush on your own.In comparison to other electric toothbrushes, I chose the Oral B because it was far more economical than other brands. It is affordable, and the brush replacement costs are very reasonable, especially when you buy bulk packages here or at a warehouse store.Now, on to this specific Oral B brushhead.  The base unit also works with the standard Oral B brushheads that I already use.  This brush head is slightly more oval shaped to mimic a tooth\'s surface and shape, versus the circular standard brushhead.  It also has a polishing cup in the center of the brush head where brush bristles would normally be present on the standard, circular brush head. So, picture the standard brush head with a polishing cup in the dead center of the brush head and you can get a mental picture of this new brush head\'s design.With the more powerful motor and new brush head, I like this Oral B better than the standard Oral B that I have been using.  It cleans even better and I really like the polishing cup since I am a heavy coffee drinker and try to minimize teeth staining.  While you can\'t go wrong with any of the Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes, I would recommend this one.  If you are still using a manual toothbrush, I would strongly suggest at least trying out an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  If you do, you will never go back to manual brushing again.UPDATE.......After using this brush head for several months now, I am convinced that it has made my teeth more white. I had worked it into my normal brushing routine and had forgotten about it.  I started to notice my teeth seemed whiter, and I couldn\'t figure out why.  I started thinking about it and realized the only change was the brush head and more powerful motor.  (my toothpaste was the same)."

The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare\'s."

I heard that Oral-B was doing a 50% rebate promotion so I decided it was time for an upgrade.  I chose the 3000 model, and I am very pleased with the purchase.  The toothbrush has a vigorous action, and my teeth feel dentist visit clean after I brush.  The 30 second timer is a nice feature that allows you to spend that amount of brushing time on the four quadrants of the mouth. The 2 minute timer lets you know that the morning/evening ritual is complete.  The storage lid hides the brush heads when not in use, and is a feature that my wife appreciates.  The one negative comment I have is that the package only comes with one brush head, but I suppose that the nice rebate more than fairly offsets the cost of additional heads."

Ths brush is relatively inexpensive, but it also feels inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.Pros:-It works. The product came out of the package, charged, and worked without a fuss. The worst part of setup was the anti-theft plastic package.-Inductive charging base. The case is 100% waterproof sealed, and power is drawn by setting the brush on a holder base so that power is transferred with no risk of electric shock. Very nice.-The brush pulses a couple of times to let you know when you\'ve done your time. Brilliant.-And it comes with an extra basic brush head.Cons:-Rattles your head like a jackhammer, negating most of the positives the moment it touches your teeth. The motor is relatively slow and cheap, so until you\'ve used it for a while and learned to adapt you\'ll be concerned that it\'s going to knock your teeth out before you\'re done cleaning them.-Standard brush head is only okay. You get the most basic brush head out of the box, which to me feels only so-so for cleaning. I sometimes have to run my brush for an extra cycle to feel really clean.Overall, if you want to try a power brush but you don\'t have the money for a more expensive model, this isn\'t a bad choice- it\'s still better than a manual brush. However, in the realm of power toothbrushes, you can and should do better. When you weigh a lifetime of painful dental cleanings and potential surgical issues from cavities against the (hopefully) one-time investment in a good power brush, there\'s really no reason to stick with an underpowered model like this that\'s going to rattle your teeth like it does.However, I\'m still going to be reusing this model for a long time to come- craft and cleaning experts know that there\'s nothing like a cheap power toothbrush for doing tasks like detail cleaning leather. For this application, this is an absolute wonder of a brush. It\'s cheap, and all the jackhammering works just fine when it\'s done on something other than your head."

It has a clean and sensitive speed. I can\'t really tell the difference between the two but if you have sensitive teeth I am pretty sure you will. It also comes with a charging stand. It is small and holds to brush heads. It has a small profile so it wont take up a lot of counter space. It also has a mount where you can screw two nails on the wall and mount the stand on the wall. The brush does a great job of cleaning my teeth. Especially between the teeth using the precision tip. The brush heads are very easy and fast to switch. It is simple to clean.

I had her try this brush out for 2 weeks to see if she could tell the difference between the two, and she could.  She said it did not feel nearly as powerful, nor did it clean nearly as well. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the form, and feel of the toothbrush.  If you simply cannot, or do not want to spend the money on the sonicare then I might buy this toothbrush.  I contacted oral b to ask if they offer a money back guarantee, which sonicare does. Oral b said they did not offer the guarantee on this model, but only on a couple of other models.  FIGURES!  The lady was polite, but I told her I was upset that I wasted my money on their product, and I will not be buying from them in the future.  We just bought a new sonicare base and it was within 4$ of what I spent for this brush, so you can no longer argue that they are in different categories.

The handle is slim and light and as easy to hold as a regular toothbrush.  The head vibration is well isolated from the handle and does not cause any discomfort.  The whole brush is completely water proof and can be washed easily.  There are no visible contacts for charging.  It just sits in the base and charges (I assume by induction) perfectly fine.It has a couple of settings for brushing or massaging and although I prefer the brushing setting for regular brushing, the massaging setting felt nice on my gums.  It has a reminder in the form of a brief pause every thirty seconds to facilitate proper brush timing.The brush comes with an additional smaller head that is meant to clean between the teeth.

The kit includes two ProWhite brush heads designed to remove surface stains and polish teeth bright white.  There are three types of brushing fibers in the ProWhite rotating brush, blue, white, and green, each with a different stiffness.  The longest and least stiff blue fibers gradually loose color with use indicating the remaining life of the brush (listed as 3 months).  There is a deep cleaning orange rubber center in the brush for deep cleaning of stains.  I have noticed a clean difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums after a week of using the ProWhite.The handle of the device fits the hand nicely because of its large diameter and a ribbed blue rubber grip covering the back of the smooth light blue plastic cylinder. The cylinder has a battery that is recharged by placing it upright on a plastic stand. The unit fits on the stand with a plastic receiver on a plastic plug, so electric shock to the user is avoided. The entire hand device can be rinsed completely (not the recharging stand).There is a built in timer on the Vitality that alerts the brusher when the recommended brush time of two minutes have elapsed with a noticeable pulsing action of the brushes and the accompanying change in sound from continuous to intermittent. After the timing alert, the device resumes continuous brushing.I highly recommend this rechargeable toothbrush.  I have switched from a regular brush to the exclusive use of the Vitality. I will order the four other brush heads each with a unique cleaning function. A $3.00 coupon for these heads is included in the kit. The rotary action of the brush is superior to the electric toothbrush I tried years ago that used an up and down motion that I did not like."

I used the Sonicare for years and found it extremely difficult to keep the brush head clean despite following all the various tips you can easily find with a quick google search.  The brush would consistently grow mold over time regardless of how careful I was.  While the Sonicare still has more bells and whistles overall (this could be due to model difference), I\'m willing to sacrifice those little things for what I think is probably one of the two criteria that actually matter: 1) how well the brush cleans and 2) how clean the brush stays.  By the way, the Oral B cleans teeth on par with Sonicare, in my own opinion."

Both of us noticed after just two or three days that our teeth were noticeably whiter and less stained. They also just FEEL really clean -- that \'just left the dentist\' feeling (the clean part, not the Novocain part).The only reason I\'m not rating this five stars is because it may be too much for those with really sensitive gums, and I\'m also a little curious about what long-term use could do to enamel if you\'re not careful.

Another feature I like is the pulsing every 30 seconds.  It is supposed to be for those who divide their brushing between 4 sections of the mouth, upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. Since I like to do the back side of my front teeth together, instead I took the first 30 second pulse as, \'Ok, you\'re halfway through the top,\' and the second as a cue to move to the bottom.It\'s amazing, how much I had to force myself to stay on the top a full minute.  I didn\'t even realize I was brushing the lower teeth more.  I recently had a cleaning where I was told my upper back teeth had more plaque than lower. Now I know why!This will keep you even in your brushing time throughout your mouth, feel great, give you a terrific clean, yet be gentle.I was SO pleased that I got one for my hubby.  We have separate bathrooms, or could have easily shared the handle.  He didn\'t do the full two minutes on our old version, but on this one he is.

It otherwise has the same features as other electronic toothbrushes ie 2 minute notification, as well as 4 30 second interruptions to let you know to move around in your mouth.

I\'m not a small person either, I\'m 6\'1\' and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  It\'s really not that different than the standard head, it\'s just bigger.  I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  Because of this, getting the brush into every nook and cranny is now more difficult.  Also, because it is bigger, it\'s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.

The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  The brush itself is cordless, although the cord on the base station would be better served if it were retractable, for space management purposes.  Oral-B claims that the rechargeable battery cannot be \'killed\' by repeated charging, so hopefully that works as advertised.  The package also comes with one replacement head, which is a value-added touch.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.Second, effectiveness.  It\'s equipped with a 2 minute timer, which indicates the suggested total brushing length.  This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner after usage, although not quite on par with visiting a dentist\'s office.  The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.The review merits the deduction of one star, due to head design.  If the head were skinnier and angled, then it could enable better access to teeth in the rear of my mouth. Overall, a very good, entry-level toothbrush from Oral-B."

I got some, and they were bad.However, the latest pack I got are genuine (ordered three weeks ago).  I see Amazon has removed all other buying options for this product.  \'Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\' is the only choice, no other vendors.  I hope this means they got wind of the counterfeiting scams and are working to ensure they\'re selling only the genuine article.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon, as well as \'Amazon Marketplace\' vendors and have never had a problem before.  I may continue ordering these here, but I\'m still not 100% confident Amazon shut out the fakes. I might go to a local chain drugstore or the oral-B site directly for the next couple packs."

I went 4 years without any real dental care, my mouth soon became the \'hoarders\' of teeth (so to speak). Recently I\'ve came across the money, the dentist, and the courage to fix them  and so far the progress has been amazing. One serious problem with my mouth were my gums, they were majorly inflamed and very, very weak. Along with that there were tight gaps between my teeth, so I could not floss. A friend gave me this and I\'m actually shocked. Not ONLY could I easily floss my teeth, but within two weeks the inflammation(Known more commonly as gingivitis)was died down to a very manageable point, and within three it was practically completely gone.Crest and their entire line of \'Pro-Health\' items have been absolutely AMAZING for my teeth. Slightly more expansive, but really really worth it.Thanks so much!"

This will ensure that they always slide on and off the handle easily. If you do not do this, the brush can become jammed on the handle due to dried up toothpaste and then you have usually have to damage the brush to get it off the handle.

My teeth feel like I just got out of the dentists office, and it gets anything out of my teeth that get stuck due to the braces.  Another huge plus is that its able to get in everywhere with hardly any pressure which is great because I had concerns about bleeding, plaque buildup + getting white streaks on my teeth.  Overall the Oral-B is easy to use, the silly little smiley face lets you know when the 2 minutes are up as well as the brush heads pulsing.

1512,1548,20090913,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 13, 2009",AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"At last, an alternative to Sonicare","Sonicare and Oral-B are the two largest manufacturers of high-end powered toothbrushes. They initially entered the market using very different technologies: ultrasonic vibration for Sonicare, rotary brushes for Oral-B.Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces. They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task. The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges. At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B\'s rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.Sonicare\'s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system. The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled. These brushes are sold under the FlexCare moniker.After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare. I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare\'s. I don\'t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied. This may actually be a good thing since you\'re supposed to only apply it gently.Oral-B includes a feature similar to what Sonicare calls the \'quad-pacer,\' essentially a timer that signals you when it\'s time to switch quadrants (every 30 seconds)Battery life is about a week.Included in the package: brush, charging stand, bonus interstitial brush... but no travel case.PROS----- a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets- very low price for this technology- easy to clean- small charging stand- small brush, great for little hands- quad pacer- setting for sensitive gumsCONS----- may be too small for some hands- charger is 110V only (you need a transformer, not just an adapter, to use it overseas)- no travel caseCONCLUSION----------Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes. At less than half the price of the cheapest FlexCare, the Pulsonic is worthy of your consideration. Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don\'t move the brush back and forth, don\'t push hard: just hold it in place and let it do its job. You will get the best results if you rinse with Listerine and floss before brushing."

I\'ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them. They were loud, heavy and large in the hand. I was hesitant to try a power toothbrush again, but my dentist suggested it was time to cave and get another. So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush. It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud. I especially like the additional small brush head that comes with it. The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth. The small size of the brush is also great for travel. For short trips I just pack the toothbrush with a regular brushhead cover. For longer trips, I throw in the base and the brush. The base is not too large, so it is not a huge annoyance to pack. My one complaint (and thus the 4 stars) would be that it does not come with a travel case. Seems kind of odd since its size makes it a great travel power toothbrush."

The next size head down is a 40.The texture is SOFT, not Medium texture, and you should optfor the SOFT, rather than the Medium; the SOFT (this one) isplently firm to do the job without mushing down and wastingyour time just going through the motions without connecting.Looking at the bristles head-on (staring at the tips of thetufts, with the plastic head in the rear), the arrangementof the tufts (the pattern) is an oval. Normally I personallydo not like such an arrangement, preferring instead a solidrectangle, so as to purchase more surface area with which toconnect to the teeth and gums. In the case of the CrossAction(manual) toothbrush\'s configuration, the lack of \'corners\' tothe brush is not noticeable, unlike other oval-shaped heads.Reason for this is two-fold (am not a tech, this is personalconjecture or observation): the outer \'rim\' or border of thebrush\'s bristles is resilient (doesn\'t give easily, no mush),AND the very tip of the brush head has a special arrangementof slightly LONGER bristles (color: solid white, no bluishindicator layer) that reach v-e-r-y effectively into netherregions of the mouth (back molars?) to route out the bugs &leftover food particles. All you need is SOFT, not Medium;should you utilize a Medium (texture rating, not size) one,you\'d gouge your gums and whatever else is in there. You\'llget enough traction and friction and devil-exorcising actionwith a SOFT CrossAction (manual) toothbrush.Do not confuse the CrossAction with the Advantage series ofOral-B manual toothbrushes; although the Advantage line hasa similar appearance (shape and combination of features), Iventure to tout the CrossAction as being superior in termsof achieving results (getting one\'s teeth and gumline cleanin the least amount of time, with the minimum of dexterity).In case you DO wish to order a single Advantage toothbrushin the same order (to compare the two brushes), go to theSearch box and either type or copy/paste the Amazon ID# forthat style, which is ASIN: B0000C4KJG. Type B0000C4KJG w/othe \'ASIN:\'. That\'ll get you to the page which concerns theSKU 086736 (full head, soft). At the time of this review ittakes two cents more to total 25 bucks, to avoid shipping.The UPC/NDC (666 barcode) number is 3-00410-60639-8 for theCrossAction 60 Soft; that\'s for ONE brush. Six-pack sleeveshave a similar but different number, but you don\'t need thatto double-check the #53 CrossAction in a retail store. Whenyou wish to hunt down our brush in the haphazardly sortedretailer\'s toothbrush rack, home in on the reddish number53, located at the extreme tip of the J-hook tab at the TOPof the individual blister package. This\'ll save you gettingfrustrated or confused when rummaging through the toothbrushrack in search of WORDS. Find Oral-B and then find the 53...Amazon saves you money (per individual toothbrush) comparedto what the stores charge (about 4 smackers each), but youcan get your mitts on a sample in a retail Rx before you doorder (in case you prefer to SEE and heft what you\'ll getas a six-count from Amazon).The two downsides are- the blister packaging is not really biodegradable (tough);- the parent company is B-I-G on animal testing (laboratoryexperiments, usually redundant, on sentient rabbit eyes...).The Oral-B CrossAction style of manual toothbrush, althoughmore expensive than shlock-brand models, is well worth themonetary outlay. The squeaky-clean satifaction will SPOILyou, and you won\'t settle for a manual toothbrush of lesserquality in the future.This brush does not include the rubber bristles along theouter edge of similar toothbrushes: they are supposed tomassage your gums, but IMHO the regular CrossAction doesenough work on both the teeth and also the gumline to actas a do-it-all toothbrush (no, it does not floss!).BTW, your dentist probably never has mentioned during allthe precious moments that you have spent together THAT THEGUMS ACT AS AN O-RING GASKET SEAL between your teeth andthe jaw-bones.

Prior reviewers have already commented on the power converter that sticks 3 inches out from the electrical wall plug - duh. Also the enigma of how to open the battery compartment of the \'Smart Guide Display unit\'. (TWO covers to be removed with gorilla fingers, sliding each in opposite directions.)Fortunately the rechargeable (Ni-MH) battery in the handle can be replaced (compared to the older Braun models that became useless once the battery died), but how to change the battery is a deeper mystery. (Amidst the very poorly written instructions, the section for replacing the rechargeable battery provides only a small diagram that is utterly unintelligible.) I went to the [...] website and clicked on \'email us\', but what a bad joke that was - I just ended in an endless search option in their FAQ section. Next I\'ll call them at [...].Oh, then you have to remember twice a year to not use the battery charger, so that the battery discharges completely in order to \'maintain the maximum capacity of the rechargeable body\'. (Since a full charge is claimed to last at least 10 days, I suppose one then turns on the toothbrush and leaves it running on the bathroom counter... hoping the internal moving parts don\'t wear out in the process.)CRITICAL: In these days of airline security concerns, if you bring the toothbrush with you (as my dentist recommends), DON\'T FORGET to deactivate the radio transmitter that is built into the toothbrush handle (to communicate with the \'Smart Guide display unit\').In summary: This is a fabulous toothbrush (10x better than my previous Braun model) but a disaster on the \'user friendliness\' scale. I can only hope that in the next few years Braun\'s competition will \'eat their lunch\' with something yet better and much simpler to use!"

I had enough supply to get me through and recently opened my last one.  I was SOOO EXCITED to find these on Amazon and that they are available as a subscribe and save product at such a great price!
1607,1649,20080828,B001CX4JSS,3,"August 28, 2008",A1VUN4JU731CBH,Not sure...,"I have pretty much had and tested them all: The Oral-B Triumph, the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, and now the Oral-B Pulsonic. Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but the Pulsonic leaves me a bit unsure.The design of this brush is very reminiscent of the Sonicare toothbrushes, right down to the stand which always looked different on all the previous Oral-B electric brushes. This design really looks like a stripped-down baby version of the Sonicare.First of, the brush itself is extremely slim and light-weight for an electric brush. So much so that one wonders whether it can actually \'do the job\'. So after charging it the required 12 hours, I tried it out for the first time. I did not find it any different in power than the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, it felt the same.What is different is that the Pulsonic\'s manual instructs the user to move the brush over the teeth in a circular motion, very much like one is supposed to do with a manual brush. I, for one, didn\'t quite like this although I can see the benefit of doing it this way. The Pulsonic has - like the Sonicare and unlike the Oral-B Triumph - a regular (yet contoured) brush head. The shape of such a brush head makes it difficult  to sufficiently cover the entire tooth. One is always either cleaning along the gumline or more towards the bite. Using circular motion prevents that only parts of the teeth are cleaned. Yet - I have been using electric toothbrushes for so long that I have gotten used to not really having to do anything but hold the brush head to the teeth. So this is a change I am not sure I like too much.Also - these rectangular brush heads don\'t seem to work too well for me personally. I have a small mouth and find it difficult to easily brush my teeth with these brush heads, especially the insides of the front teeth. It always feels as if I can\'t quite reach all the surfaces, especially the areas along the gumline, and that leaves me wondering whether I get as complete a cleaning as I should be getting.Philips has tried to address this problem by offering a smaller brush head for the Sonicare, but Oral-B doesn\'t seem to have that. So this is not optimal for me.What I did like about the Pulsonic though is that it comes with a second \'Precision Tip\' brush head. I found this to be a great way to really get into the spaces between teeth and I give Oral-B a big thumbs-up for this one.Lastly, the Pulsonic, like the other models and brands, informs the user audibly when it is time to change to a different \'quadrant\' to be brushed, and when the two minutes recommended brush time are over.All in all this is probably a brush I will take along when travelling - the light weight but equal power output make it perfect for that, but at home I will likely stay with the Oral-B Triumph and its round brush heads. I just feel that these heads reach all areas of my teeth better and also feel more comfortable on the sensitive areas of my mouth."

I was truly sad when the poor ol\' guy bit the dust. After a week without an electric toothbrush I realized I needed to get another and researched Sonicare vs. OralB/Braun. I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn\'t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 & 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I\'m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn\'t expecting that big of a difference.The only thing I don\'t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn\'t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn\'t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.

I would recommend it as an entry-level electric toothbrush to those who are too unsure about the technology to pay for one of the more higher priced models.Full disclosure: I received this toothbrush free as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, at the low cost of $29.99 I probably would\'ve bought it anyway. I think it is definitely worth that price for a first-time electric toothbrush.PROSCLEANING: My teeth get much cleaner when I use this toothbrush versus my traditional one. They feel smooth, just like I came from the dentist. Flossing also seems easier while using this toothbrush because, with the right tilt on the brush, it is better able to clean between my teeth and at the gum line, so there seems to be less tartar buildup when I floss.WHITENING: The stain removal is EXCELLENT. My teeth are not that stained, but during the 2 weeks I\'ve been using this brush, I\'ve noticed a *significant* decrease in the yellow stains near my gum line.BATTERY: This may sound odd, but I liked the way the battery ran out. I was a bit concerned about what would happen and how I would handle it (the instructions give no clue). It pretty much just stops working, no wind-down at all. I liked that because it left no mystery as to \'will it or won\'t it\' finish and I just finished brushing my teeth with it manually. I\'ve used this toothbrush 1-2 times per day for over 2 weeks now, and I\'ve only had to charge it once.REPLACEMENTS: The brush indicates when it needs to be replaced via color loss on the bristles (just like some traditional toothbrushes do). It does come with an extra head, as well as a $3 coupon for another one.CONSDROPLETS: The only negative on this toothbrush is probably just due to my inexperience with electric toothbrushes: it sprays toothpaste droplets onto my clothing. Now I try to brush my teeth before I dress, or else I drape a hand towel over my blouse while brushing.VIBRATIONS: As others have mentioned, the vibrations are INCREDIBLY strong on this toothbrush. You should NOT press it hard against your teeth; just lay it gently onto them and let the brush do the work for you. My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive (I have several cracked ones) and once I stopped pressing with the brush, I had no problems with pain due to the vibrations. However, the vibrations DO make my nose ticklish.Unlike other reviewers, I have NOT experienced any \'gunk\' buildup in the toothbrush stand because I always rinse off my toothbrush the way the instructions say to. (If you put ANY toothbrush back in its holder without rinsing it well enough, you\'re going to get \'gunk.\')Overall, I would recommend this as a fine first electric toothbrush, especially at this price point."

No biggie though, it\'s pretty easy to become acclimated to that system quickly!"

It is powerful and leaves your mouth feeling like you have had a good tooth and gum scrubbing and massage.  While doing a great job it is gentle enough that leaves you wanting to more.  I tend to be somewhat lax about how long I brush.  This lets you know how long to brush in increments and before long you are done.  It leaves you wanting to keep right on a brushing.  You can put different kinds of brushes on it if you like and that is a nice feature.  Highly recommended.

I decided to try the Amazon brush replacements to save money -- $4 brushes for $12.  A good deal - right?  Wrong!  I purchased the brushes on 12/1/09.  I am already on my 3rd brush!  The first two each had the same problem -- something in the head loosened causing the head to wobble when in use on the brush.  As it wobbled, it pinched my tongue & gums -- my tongue actually had bleeding cuts from it!  Both of the first two heads are defective, & of poor quality.  This never happened with the expensive heads -- I never had a problem, I used them until the color faded, & then threw them away.  I am totally disappointed in these Amazon heads.

The bristles are the softest I\'ve seen on an electric toothbrush and will not wear away your teeth and gums if light pressure is used. The head moves in a spinning motion but does not make a full 360 but rather it rotates about 90 degrees to the left then back to the right.

Can use pretty standard Oral-B type larger brush-heads that you can buy at Costco or Amazon in family size 6-packs.Can\'t think of any cons to having this toothbrush as its much better than buying some expensive toothbrush rechargeable kit that doesn\'t use standard AA batteries or comes with a watering system that I wouldn\'t use.

Oral B has discontinued the Sonic line.  So, I tried the Professional Care/Smart Series - what an improvement!  I like it much better than the Sonic Complete.  It brushes much more thoroughly.On the downside, it is a bit louder (not a big deal) and the RPM drops noticeably as the days go by until I recharge it.  (I don\'t leave it in the charger after every use, only when the battery is almost dead).I went with the 5000 over the lower models because the price was insignificantly higher at the time.  I will admit that I don\'t use the advanced features that the 5000 has over the lower models.  The massaging and other brushing modes don\'t impress me; I just use the regular mode.  (I used to use the soft mode on the Sonic Complete, but I don\'t have a problem with the aggressiveness of the regular mode in the 5000).  The clock/brushing timer is interesting for the first couple of weeks, but now I totally ignore it.  Kind of nice to have a clock in the bathroom when you are getting ready for work, that\'s the only benefit.  The quality of the toothbrush and the clock unit is very impressive.I use the soft headed brushes.I have been using the toothbrush for six months now.  Dentist report was \'all ok\'."

It was on way too tightly - even my cleaning man - a strong man - had a bit of trouble.  I did NOT have enough pressure.  I always worry about damaging my thumbs because . . .I did damage my thumb joints (both) once trying to take off a cap of baby aspirin.  Go figure!The directions on the baby aspirin said it required two thumbs to lift on both sides and I really hurt my thumb joints on both hands - still not quite healed after almost a year.  I never successfully got the top off - someone else did it for me.  If our 4 year old granddaughter had been here, she  would have been able to take off the childproof cap for me.

My old one was getting long in the tooth(sorry about pun!) and running real slow, so I investigated buying a new one.  Since they were on a 50% rebate sale, i just bought the top of the line 5000 unit.  I could not be more pleased with how clean my teeth end up - I have never had a brush that cleans as well as this one; my hygienist will be so pleased!I would like to expound on the advantages of this unit over the 4000 or 3000 in cleaning ability, but I have no idea, not having used the others.  If the only difference is gimmicks, then this unit is certainly full of them, and you might be just as pleased with a cheaper unit without the unnecessary gimmicks and modes.One big con: there is a mode button to toggle through the 5 different modes that are built into this unit.  Most people, like me, will probably only use one mode, or at least will predominately use one mode.  The mode button is VERY poorly placed, in a very key position.  It is impossible to use this unit without accidentally hitting the mode key on a regular basis, if not every day.  Very annoying to have to figure out how to get back to your preferred mode.  They could not have chosen a poorer location for this if that was the goal.  Its like accidentally hitting the caps lock key on a laptop, for those who do not look at the screen while we type. What were they thinking, if they were thinking at all?  I like good design.  All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an \'F\' for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO. It was just too big a mistake to be an oversight. A smaller con - the outlet plug is a huge unit that sticks straight out from the wall - takes up space and looks stupid - should have been flush.Yet overall, I gave this 4 stars for the great cleaning and the rest of the design and charger."

It broke off, falling into my hand, as I was very gently trying to inspect it to see what was wrong. I hate paying retail for these, but I went back to biting the bullet on price to make sure I bought the real deal. I am happy I did. Make sure you buy the ones made by Oral B. You will like them. I have been using them for at least 4 years and let me tell you, the dental hygenist spends a lot less time in my mouth - and doesn\'t have to scrape and dig around the gumline so much anymore.

The Oral-B power toothbrush easily cleans the hard-to-reach areas of your teeth, removing more plaque than an ordinary toothbrush. Users will see a clear difference within the first few brushings.One thing to note, however, is that this toothbrush has a fairly long cord. So, depending on your bathroom sink area and outlet setup, you may run into the same problem I did, of the cord crossing the entire sink and getting in the way of the other things on the surface.

The odd number of three Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush Heads and one useless precision head is inconvenient for two people. After replacing each of our Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush Heads twice evening out two boxes our Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush malfunctioned. New colors should be added.

At first, I was shocked.  This thing vibrates (like a buzz) your head when brushing the top teeth.  It is kind of like a dentist drill but much more dynamic.  It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \'dentist office\' cleaning.  After one week I have already seen the difference.  The company advertises two weeks, but one will show results.  It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  The bristles are somewhat hard without the slightest irritation to the gums.  Since this device uses NiCad batteries, I do not keep the charger plugged.  It has gone 2 weeks without need for recharging.  That is amazing.The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  The \'timer\' feature is great and is very useful.  The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  The tiny brush (floss head) supplied with it is useless.  I wish they would have placed an extra tooth brush in it\'s place.  The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  It is hardly bigger than a manual tooth brush.I very much recommend this tooth brush.  There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.  I question whether the costs difference would be worth it."
1594,1635,20080914,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 14, 2008",AUCIFMWP3DU8R,\'The Circular Motion: Rub It.\',"Thanks, Frank.Upon acquiring this device I wondered if it would soon join the collection of previous failed attempts at \'better and easier oral hygiene through technology\' currently growing mold under the bathroom sink.So far so good. It is too early to evaluate the long-term benefits promised by this product, but I find it a very simple and practical design, easy to store, clean and use. It is slim in the hand and very lightweight, most of my earlier experiments were thick and bulky, and cumbersome to navigate around the mouth. Like brushing your teeth with a flashlight.The Oral-B has a good feel to it, natural and well-balanced, and that makes me more likely to pick it up instead of a \'manual\' brush. The brush itself is rather petite, but this makes getting into tight areas a little easier. The noise was startling at first, a shrill buzz that reminded me of another reason I never took to electrics: it shatters the quiet ritual of morning and evening brushing.But if it works, it will be worth it. I  have so far found the single biggest complaint is that my usual rather aggressive style of use needs to be restrained, or the brush head will twist off of the body. It\'s a � turn quick release, and this is great for cleaning and sanitizing, but it seems to pop off in the mouth rather easily. How the bristles survive until I learn a gentler touch remains to be seen. I have to remember it\'s like running a polishing tool, not a backhoe.The unit is totally sealed and waterproof, as is the charger-base. Makes clean-up a cinch, and with induction charging connection, no pesky exposed electrical connections. Pretty much standard these days, I would expect. Another small but obvious feature that you\'d only notice if it was not there: the motor shuts off upon return to the base, like hanging up a phone.It has two speeds, \'normal\' and \'sensitive\'. I find normal is probably better to use, it tickles quite a but but it is not too hard to get used to. I use the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant. I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits. A double-blip signals the end of the session, as does a mouthful of hyper-foamed toothpaste. Try not to drool, OK?"

I\'ve been using it for about 3 weeks, and I\'ve noticed a vast improvement in my teeth.  You know that area behind your front bottom teeth?  You know, the area where you get tons of plaque build-up?  I HATE that spot!  I\'ve flossed religiously, and brushed like crazy to make that plaque go away, and it never really does!  Well, after three weeks of using this toothbrush, I\'ve noticed hardly any plaque in that problem-area!  My husband is so impressed that we purchased extra brushheads for him to try it out and he\'s sold as well.There are three brushing options.  1) regular 2) sensitive 3) whitening.  I tend to always brush on the third level of Whitening.  I really like the light up indicator telling you that you are pressing too hard.  Also, there is a timer that vibrates when you should move to the next quadrant of your mouth.The stand and charger are also a nice perk.  The stand comes with 4 compartments to store the brushheads, as well as the charger stand.  But if you don\'t think the extra part of the brushhead storage is needed, you can only use the charging portion to take up less space.Overall, this is a fanastic toothbrush by Oral B.

I\'m very satisfied with my purchase and look forward to brushing my teeth and getting a smiley face when I\'ve completed my 2 minutes! =)  The only con would be that I wish the clock had a light on it so when I\'m brushing late at night or early in the morning without my bathroom light on, I\'d still be able to see the countdown.

This toothbrush wowed me from the moment that I took it out of the box. First I have to point out that it comes FULLY CHARGED. Since when does an electronic item arrive at your door without needing charging? I was able to take it out and to use it immediately! The next thing I noticed was how much lighter it was than my three year old sonic toothbrush. It was more slender, shorter, and much, much more comfortable to hold. When I pulled the base out of the box I was simply astounded - how could something so small be a charger? I\'d been used to this huge base and now all I had to deal with was this tiny little thing, barely big enough to fit the base of the brush, but it did and it was extremely sturdy as well.The big challenge, though, was the brushing. My Vitality had a 2 minute warning feature on it, where it sort of stutters in the vibrations when two minutes is up. I loaded up the toothbrush with toothpaste and started the brushing. I could immediately notice the difference from my new Oral-b to my old sonic toothbrush, as this one rotated instead of just going up and down. I could simply gently guide the brush from one tooth to another, just like my dentist does, and the teeth were getting cleaned!Two minutes actually took much longer than I thought, and I was a bit ashamed to realize that I hadn\'t been brushing a whole two minutes for quite awhile! But eventually the stuttering happened and I turned off the brush and looked closely to see what the cleaning had done.WOW. Not only did the brush get in between a lot of my teeth to get some things that would normally be gotten by flossing, but it also polished my teeth as well! I was able to run my tongue around my teeth and was shocked to realize that my teeth felt exactly the same way after my home cleaning as it does after I\'m done a visit at the dentists.I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and am interested in the different heads that you can get to go on the toothbrush! If this head does such an amazing job, I wonder how good the other heads are!"

I bought it to replace a brush that cost over $150 and it does a better job. The small, rotating head easily gets to the gum line of even the rear teeth.  Only negative is that there is no low battery warning so it will die in the middle of a brushing episode if you don\'t regularly plug in the charger-stand. That\'s a small inconvenience - one not worth $100+.  Just in case, on the day the Oral B is recharging, you can always use the brush given to you by your dentist at your last visit, unless you used it for cleaning grout."

It has 2 speeds, a charger base, a regular brush head and a small head to do in between teeth. It is a very nice design and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because it doesn\'t sit firmly in the base and is easy to knock it out of the base, it wobbles when bumped lightly. I also feel the brush head could be slightly smaller but the size is OK, I just like the smaller brush heads. It says the charge will last for about 4 hours which is good since brushing teeth only takes about 2 minutes. This is a very nice pulsing toothbrush for a little less money than some that works well.

I had read about third party seller selling fake brush head refills, but since the price wasn\'t ridiculously low, I thought that they had to be genuine oral-B brush heads.  However, as soon as I looked at the brushes through the clear package, I could tell that the brushes are knock-offs.  I had recently bought the same exact 3-pack from a store, so I compared the ones I got to the genuine oral-B refills, and noticed the following: the bristles are not really standing straight up like the real ones, the center bristles are of different color, and even the \'oral-B\' trademark on the brushes are of different color (the trademark should be blue, but the one on the fake brushes are gray) and small than the real ones.  the packaging looks almost the same (the fake package even says the brushes were \'made in Germany\'), but there are subtle differences: the font on the back of the package is much thicker than that on the real one, the \'2\' attached to the 2nd picture on the back of the package is lacking the shadow, and the pictures are fuzzy.

Yesterday I got to remember that before the blue color on the bristle would lose gradually, indicating when you need a new one.

I\'m also concerned that some of the power brushes are too powerful - my teeth get sensitive. After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I\'ve been doing pretty well with the cheap Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary). Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.It\'s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it\'s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn\'t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that\'s it. I think that when the battery dies it\'s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn\'t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don\'t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn\'t a concern for me. I\'m planning to buy this brush for my children to try. For an entry level power brush, this is a solid choice."

It\'s also relatively portable, so good for travel too, though you\'ll need to bring the charger along for longer trips.The Pulsonic is not as gentle on your teeth and gums as most of the more expensive toothbrushes I\'ve owned, but I haven\'t had any problems with it. It just feels like the motor does not run quite as fast or as smoothly and I think that probably makes it a little less effective at getting your teeth completely clean. It is certainly a lot better than my old manual toothbrush though! Overall I think it works very well.I bought it about a month after my previous (2-3X the price) electric brush broke, so I\'d been using a manual brush for a bit. After a week of using the Pulsonic my teeth were noticeably whiter and have gotten whiter since then. I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past- my soda drinking youth eventually caught up with me I guess:(. I\'ve had this brush for a year and my dentist says my teeth and gums are in great shape.My only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn\'t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right? If you\'re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don\'t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic."

I GENERALLY am a review & research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I\'ve read reviews on but I went in for a dental appointment years ago and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding & inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers so I was sold! I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn\'t compare any former experience and simply didn\'t know any better.  I DO have to say that other than my \'unsanitary\' concern about these that I\'ll get to in a moment, it\'s great! I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard, it\'s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine, I have never had any \'break\' or get wobbly on me, there is a color indicator where the blue area on your toothbrush gets lighter over time to let you know when it\'s time to swap out your toothbrush, etc.Let me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it\'s clean & smells good, my home is clean - in fact I\'m actually somewhat of a germaphobe so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  I know it\'s odd to point all that out but I didn\'t want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  :-).No matter WHAT I do...I\'ve tried using bottled water to brush my teeth thinking it\'s our tap water (it\'s not...my kids & hubby don\'t have an issue w/ their toothbrushes); I\'ve tried switching to a different toothsoap / tooth powder / toothpaste - and I STILL have the same issue.  My hubby & dentist have confirmed that I don\'t have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth so it\'s not in my mouth...so I\'m left to think that is DEFINITELY the DESIGN of Oral-B toothbrush replacements heads!!!Humor me for a minute and do a \'zoom\' on the picture of Oral-B replacement toothbrushes in the middle of the toothbrush handle.  There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle while brushing then certainly a mixture of that & water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets in.I DO make a habit of actually removing my brush head in running water and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks & on the bottom where you place the charger) AND on the toothbrush head itself - both on the brush area and on & inside the handle and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide & a clean washcloth (since I didn\'t know where the smell was coming from) AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  It does NOT happen when I take all of these precautions but in my opinion, I shouldn\'t HAVE to do this in order to avoid the musty smell...musty stench means that bacteria is harboring & growing so to stick something filled with germs to \'clean\' with is not the best option in my opinion.FYI: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it\'s not me and sure enough, it\'s not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn\'t have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I\'m currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it\'s a design flaw in the brush design.I\'d rather not have to worry if my toothbrush is growing bacteria or not, I want to simply rinse the brush & handle after each use and store it away like I\'m supposed to be able to do.  I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  I don\'t understand how anyone else hasn\'t complained about this issue - maybe I\'m taking care of them wrong but I\'ve even called the company and it was suggested that maybe it was our water or toothpaste...when I told her that my other family members didn\'t have this issue, she was at a loss.For those who are also looking & comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it\'s more dome shaped so the toothpaste \'gunk\' from brushing & rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the \'dome shape\' vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle & electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B\'s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it\'s hard to get in small areas of your mouth."

1950,1995,20111102,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 2, 2011",AGSC327PXS3W6,Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 - High end dental care,"The last of my 3 Sonicare Advantage electric toothbrush handles died about 2 weeks ago. I got the idea to try to replace the battery but the case has no easy way of opening and my attempt resulted in a shattered case -- it went in my batteries-to-be-recycled bag. I have an Oral-B Vitality I got cheap for under $20 over a year ago because I like to have more than one electric toothbrush (big house). However, it\'s action seemed primitive to me compared to my Sonicares, so I started shopping. Costco has a current coupon on a pair of Sonicares but I decided to look online and see what I could find out and/or buy.I decided on the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 in spite of the fact that there appears to be no rebate available for it at this time. The reasons I decided on the 5000 are several. Firstly, it appears to be not difficult to replace the battery when the time comes. The replacement batteries are easily found on ebay and several of those listings (and other YouTube videos) feature  detailed instructions on how to do the replacement. You do have to use a solder iron, but I\'ve been handy with one since I was a teenager, so no big deal. I would not buy another Sonicare if I thought it might not be possible to replace the battery.Why get the best Oral-B going in spite of the price? I am a frugal guy, extremely so, but in this instance I figure it\'s time to splurge. I have only one set of teeth. The dentist does not scare me, nor the oral surgeon, but I know that the bills can come to literally thousands of dollars. If I obsess a little on my oral hygiene, so much the better! My wallet, teeth, breathe and smile will all benefit! Oh, and my general health. Oral health is a very important part of one\'s overall health.I discovered that the extra brushes I bought for my Oral-B Vitality will work fine with my 5000, cool!The Smart Guide? Well, it\'s OK, it\'s a plus, but no biggie. The biggest advantage of it is if you use more than one mode. It shows you which brushing mode you are using, and it is possible to be in a mode you didn\'t know you were in unless you glance at the Smart Guide. This happened once to me already. I hadn\'t intended to use other than the default mode, but I\'d inadvertently pressed the mode advance button.When I got the 5000, it had no charge and I set it in the charging cradle but nothing happened and I thought maybe the battery was bad. I\'d looked at the instructions on charging but hadn\'t read down to the short paragraph where it says that the battery icon on the handle\'s LCD may not appear for 10-15 minutes the first time you charge it. I still hadn\'t seen that part of the instructions when I got the idea to place the handle in the charging cradle of my Sonicare brush, thinking the Oral-B\'s might be inoperative. Just a second or two in that cradle gave the battery enough oomph to show the battery icon, I then charged it fully in the Oral-B\'s cradle and everything\'s been fine since.The Sonicares I had would pulse briefly every 30 seconds and turn off after 2 minutes. The Oral-B does the every-30-second pulsing, but keeps on going when the 2 minutes is up. I like the fact that the Oral-B keeps on going and lets me decide when I want to turn it off.I picked up mine off ebay for about $12 less than the lowest price I\'ve seen here. The price here has varied by about $10 (i.e. 10%) just over the last week. If I were in no hurry I\'d have waited for another 50% off rebate offer, however.You have to insert the brush in your mouth before turning it on so as not to spray toothpaste all over.  Likewise, you have to turn it off before removing it from your mouth. After doing that, I place it under running tap water, and while holding it under the stream of water I turn on the brush for a few seconds and let it clean itself of toothpaste, then turn off the tap leaving the brush running for a few more seconds to let it shake off most of the water so it will dry quickly.I\'ve always brushed before flossing. I always use a dental pick as well (strongly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist, it\'s the end of a round toothpick, held in a handle called the \'perio-aid 3\', given me by my dentist). A couple of days ago I started wondering if I should really brush first and did an Internet search on the subject and found out that brushing is recommended to come last because dislodging plaque from the tooth/gum-line gives your fluoride toothpaste access to the tooth surfaces, re-mineralizing those surfaces, making them more resistant to decay. So, now I\'m brushing last."

What a disappointment!  Shoddy construction -- the brush part twists off so easily that it came off twice while I was using it, and it vibrates your hand more than in your mouth.  It also lacks a brush cover, something I was used to with the Sonicare.  Seems more sanitary to cover the bristles of a toothbrush that lives in the bathroom, right?I am returning the Pulsonic tomorrow.  I may just keep my old faithful Sonicare, which may be homely but has worked great for about 7 years."

It\'s actually a pleasure to use; I never reach for my manual toothbrush anymore. There\'s a learning curve but not overwhelming.  Once I got the hang of it, I was amazed at how simple it was - put on the brush head, apply toothpaste, press the button and enjoy.  Rinse the whole thing under water, dry and stand in its recharger.  That\'s it. It has been very effective at removing old stains - without damaging my gums - something I found hard to do with a manual toothbrush.  It actually feels good to use and I often go a little longer than the timer suggests."

What a concept.","I\'ve had the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 for a few weeks now, and am very glad I got it, although it took the 50% off deal to get me to go for it.The very first day, I could feel that my teeth were cleaner. I also drink coffee and iced tea, and within the first week, I could see my teeth were noticeably whiter.  Layers of built-up plaque, gone.  Even my gums are looking healthier.I almost went with the 4000, but am glad I spent a few bucks more for the 5000, because that little clock/timer thing has, for the first time, gotten me to really pay attention to how long I brush, and I dutifully do the full 30 seconds on each quadrant.From what I\'ve read, the only thing to really watch out for are counterfeit brush head replacements.Would I buy this toothbrush again?  Absolutely.  Would I recommend it to a friend?  Yep."

I previously had the sonicare toothbrush but bought the Oral B on the recommendation of my dentist.  I got the 50% off rebate so the difference in price was about $4.  The separate timer really comes in handy...it doubles as a clock in the bathroom and is handy to see how much time you have left and what quadrant you are on.

I use such a filter with the basket so as to make cleanup easier as well as to filter out more of the particles from the grinds.  A design change is in order in my opinion.

So my comments are not just for the head. In fact, it is the toothbrush that matters. The sonic complete toothbrush is very efficient and comfortable to use and keep my teeth cleaner than regular toothbrush. The toothbrush feels like the sonicating cleaning."

It is a shame that no one knows about them. I only knew of them because my old dentist used to give them out at my cleanings, but I since have moved, and could not find them in stores."

You can find the smaller, single round brush in just about any store, but not the dual action. Maybe I like this brush better because I\'m a guy and it actually feels like I have some toothbrush in my mouth. I tried the single brush and it just seems like it wasn\'t covering enough teeth. Both do a great job! People with smaller mouths may want to try both brushes to see which is more comfortable for them. I have had the Oral B system for 4 years now and my dental check-ups seem to have steadily improved. Maybe it\'s just because brushing seems so much easier that I do it more regularly."

It continues working after the two minute timer (apparently others don\'t, which I read in reviews).  The only down side is that it only lasts about 4 days off the charger, so if you are going on a longer trip you would have to bring the base with.  Otherwise, so far so good!"

I had an electric for years, finally died.  This price on this one looked great, but I was concerned about the \'flossing\' claim on these heads.  After my dental visit I no longer doubt the claims."

I am happy to report that this is not the case in this instance.  In fact, I\'ve signed-up for the automatic delivery, and have not been disappointed.  Since I am predisposed to periodontal disease, I need a brush that will keep the gumline free of plaque and be able to reach under the gumline into the pockets.  This brush is ideal for that, and I have had no problems dealing  with this company.  So, you can rest assured that you will be getting the \'real thing.\'"

Fortunately she loves to floss, but is very hard on her flossers.  These are the best ones we\'ve tried. They survive multiple flossings without breaking or shredding.  Far superior to 3 others we\'ve tried, all of which broke or shredded after one use.  Great product, highly recommended. The box comes w/ half girl and half boy oriented designs.  The buzz lightyear ones are a bit less wieldy, but still great."

Even uses my extra brush heads from my old battery operated Oral-B toothbrush.  Does an excellent job of cleaning.  The clock/timer helps assure proper brushing of all areas.  I like the flexibility of the different settings although I have only used the regular setting for 2 minute brushing.  Holds a full charge for somewhere between 3 and 4 weeks (I normally brush once a day) so I can put the charging unit out of site between charges and put the hand held unit in a drawer saving on counter space.

I didn\'t even realize how long it had been since I replaced them until I took a survey that asked when I last replaced my brush heads and realized I was an outlier.  So I\'ve ordered another batch.I use one brushhead and change it to another for my toddler son to use.  Effective and and long-lasting.  I can\'t ask for anything more."
