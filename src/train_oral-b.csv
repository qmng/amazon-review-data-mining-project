1599,1640,20080904,B001CX4JSS,3,"September 4, 2008",AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU,"Good, but Oral B Triumph 9900 is Better","I used a Sonicare toothbrush for 2 years before switching to an Oral-B Triumph, so I\'m familiar with these types of sonic toothbrushes.The design of this Oral-B Pulsonic is quite nice.  I like that it\'s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison.  On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare.  And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general. (I also have their Pulsonic razor)  I also like the design of the charging unit and extra cleaning attachment as well.But as I said earlier, I switched from Sonicare to an Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.  And for me, comparing this Pulsonic to the Triumph... well, there\'s just no comparison.  The Triumph is better by far.  Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you\'re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.I\'ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it\'s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won\'t last long.  I can bring my Triumph on a 10 day vacation without the charging unit (and I brush twice a day.)  I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn\'t have a big enough battery to do that.  And even if it does, that just goes to show you the cleaning power.  This one is subtle, and good if you have sensitive teeth and gums.So if you want a good, deep clean, buy the Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide."
2285,2337,20101118,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 18, 2010",A25QYVSLM6DLZ0,Great buy!,"I\'m so happy I got this toothbrush.  It\'s expensive, but totally worth it.  I really appreciate that the package includes the batteries and an extra brush head - it shows that the company\'s not trying to nickel and dime its customers.  It works really well and the timer on it makes it super easy to brush just as long as you\'re supposed to!"
1616,1658,20111130,B001CX4JSS,5,"November 30, 2011",A1TGTD8UE2WNE4,very nice unit,"had this for a few years now , battery still works well and it cleans well while being nice and slim. overall its a winner - would buy it again.only con as always brush heads cost too much"
2484,2542,20091229,B002HWS9GG,1,"December 29, 2009",ATQNGMOHP0VRJ,Fabulous toothbrush but LOUSY design & mainenance,"As a toothbrush the Oral B 5000 is outstanding - 5 Stars! Prior reviewers have already commented on the power converter that sticks 3 inches out from the electrical wall plug - duh. Also the enigma of how to open the battery compartment of the \'Smart Guide Display unit\'. (TWO covers to be removed with gorilla fingers, sliding each in opposite directions.)Fortunately the rechargeable (Ni-MH) battery in the handle can be replaced (compared to the older Braun models that became useless once the battery died), but how to change the battery is a deeper mystery. (Amidst the very poorly written instructions, the section for replacing the rechargeable battery provides only a small diagram that is utterly unintelligible.) I went to the [...] website and clicked on \'email us\', but what a bad joke that was - I just ended in an endless search option in their FAQ section. Next I\'ll call them at [...].Oh, then you have to remember twice a year to not use the battery charger, so that the battery discharges completely in order to \'maintain the maximum capacity of the rechargeable body\'. (Since a full charge is claimed to last at least 10 days, I suppose one then turns on the toothbrush and leaves it running on the bathroom counter... hoping the internal moving parts don\'t wear out in the process.)CRITICAL: In these days of airline security concerns, if you bring the toothbrush with you (as my dentist recommends), DON\'T FORGET to deactivate the radio transmitter that is built into the toothbrush handle (to communicate with the \'Smart Guide display unit\').In summary: This is a fabulous toothbrush (10x better than my previous Braun model) but a disaster on the \'user friendliness\' scale. I can only hope that in the next few years Braun\'s competition will \'eat their lunch\' with something yet better and much simpler to use!"
87,88,20061104,B00006ANDK,5,"November 4, 2006",A2SCWOZ9V5EZ7I,a+ from your dental hyginiest,the gentle brushhead makes brushing with the powerful oral b handle a pleasant experience. i never liked the regular \'soft\' brushes that are included with the electric toothbrush so i never switched till i found this alternative. works with the new triumph too.
2003,2050,20110908,B002HWS9GG,5,"September 8, 2011",A558YFSSD79ZK,"Great, great, great!","It is awesome. Its strong but gently, I can feel my mouth so clean!Just love it. Happy face at the end its the cherry upon the cake :)"
2328,2382,20101022,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 22, 2010",A1PGPH3OVITWWL,Excellent Toothbrush!,"I\'ve always taken very good care of my teeth, and thanks to that they are in great shape. My mother spent a lot of money on me as a child; she paid for me to have braces two different times. I always want to have good teeth for aesthetic reasons, and also because my mom invested so much in my teeth even though paying for braces twice wasn\'t so easy for her. I figure it\'s the least I can do, considering what she did for me.I have been wanting a rechargeable toothbrush for a long time, and I wanted the best I could buy in the Oral B line. I kind of thought that $100 was pretty high for a toothbrush, but they are offering the 50% rebate right now. When I get the rebate check, I\'ll really only have $50 in it. And that\'s not a bad price for a product that helps you keep your mouth healthier. I would have eventually bought this toothbrush at full price without a rebate, but the 50% rebate really pushed me to go ahead and buy it now.I got my toothbrush about 4 days ago, and I absolutely love it so far. I feel like it does a much better job than a manual toothbrush ever could. I\'ve been brushing in the Deep Clean mode, which is 3 minutes. Sometimes I even continue brushing for a minute or two after the 3 minutes on the Smart Guide has passed. My teeth feel so smooth when I\'m finished brushing; it\'s amazing.I love the Smart Guide that comes with this toothbrush. The timer really helps you see how long to brush in each quadrant before moving on to the next. I feel like I\'m getting a professional cleaning at home.I read a lot of reviews on here before making my purchase, which was very helpful. I did read a few reviews where people had said they experienced some bleeding from their gums, but I haven\'t had any trouble with that at all.So far, I\'m thrilled with this toothbrush and hope it continues to impress me. My twice yearly dental cleanings/checkups are always great, but I\'m really anxious for my next visit to see if the hygienist notices less plaque buildup, etc.If you\'re thinking about a rechargeable toothbrush, this is an excellent choice. The rebate right now can\'t be beat either!"
2736,2808,20110814,B003UKKHB4,2,"August 14, 2011",A1B3Z6Z5VTLLR5,Does not compare to Sonicare,"I\'ve been using a SOnicare for the past 8 yrs or so and didn\'t want to spend the $$$ for a new version with the pressure sensor so I bought this one.  It feels & sounds like a Crest spinbrush that you buy for a lot less.  The brushhead sticks out a bit in the back so even though the brush head looks compact, it isnt as easy to maneuver behind your back teeth.  It really feels like a powered toothbrush that was designed 5 yrs ago - not very refined."
258,264,20090511,B00006ANDQ,5,"May 11, 2009",AGW2VSA9HH50D,Great value,"These same replacement heads at a retail store are approximately $25 for a pack of 3.  Since I only paid appx. $11 for a pack of 4, this is an amazing value, especially since they are the actual name brand, not a knock off."
2944,3024,20110720,B003UKM90Q,3,"July 20, 2011",A3HWTA1DX08UAJ,Not thrilled with \'Vitality\' w/o Braun\'s SENSITIVE brush heads,"First off, this thing is crazy loud.  Haven\'t they improved on this over the years?  I\'m still thinking about returning it because the sound is a bit jarring.  Also, if you have sensitive teeth or gums, forget it.  You probably WON\'T like the toothbrush heads that come with this brush.  Thankfully I bought another set of brushes:  Braun\'s \'sensitive\' toothbrush heads.  These brushes are much softer, and should arrive as a set like this to begin with.Update:  I do like this toothbrush, but only in conjunction with Braun\'s sensitive toothbrush heads.  Cleans teeth VERY well! A+"
1511,1547,20090913,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 13, 2009",A1AR57EZAZO446,From an electric toothbrush newbie,"I\'ve used this toothbrush for a week now. At first it tingled so much touching my tongue that I had to take a break from brushing, but after a few days I got used to it. I haven\'t used electric toothbrushes before, so I can only compare the Oral-B Pulsonic to manual toothbrushes. I find that the Pulsonic leaves my teeth feeling smoother than my manual toothbrush and, apart from the tingling, it doesn\'t seem to have any negative effect on my gums.Pros:* Non-contact induction charging mechanism means there\'s no metal contacts to get dirty and prevent charging* Built-in timer to remind you to spend the recommended 30s brushing each quandrant of your teeth* The smaller of the interchangeable brush heads allows you to brush hard-to-reach areas* Teeth feel very clean and smooth after brushingCons:* Non-contact charging mechanism is less efficient than a wired connection and therefore wastes energy* Rechargeable battery is not replaceable - the entire toothbrush must be replaced when the battery wears out* It doesn\'t come with a carrying case. This makes it difficult to take with you when traveling, especially considering you need to take the charger, the brush and the other brush head.Full disclosure: I received a free sample to review but was not paid nor otherwise compensated for the review."
1320,1351,20110907,B0014IKO6C,5,"September 7, 2011",A20R0Q1CI2KUIV,Very happy with this purchase,"Been using disposable filters for the longest time till someone suggested I get this type. True to its claim, fits my unit perfectly. Very happy with it. Highly recommended."
3024,3108,20110112,B003XDQ76M,4,"January 12, 2011",ANJ6SEYMON2ZU,Minty Fresh!,"Not sure what your preference is but this floss works great for me! I have been using this product for 3 weeks and it is smooth gliding and quite refreshing. At first, my gums would bleed on the lower right side of my mouth when flossing and now 3 weeks later, they don\'t. I do however wish the quantity was larger than 38.2 YDs and I am slightly concerned about the Cetylpyridinium Chloride, I Wikipediaed it."
2345,2399,20101011,B002HWS9GG,2,"October 11, 2010",ARH5CXFNKS4YT,Update,"I ordered the toothbrush from Amazon on Wednesday and it arrived on Friday packaged securely but in an easy-to-open box.  In other words, not in hard plastic that had to be cut.  I have had it for only three days, so cannot evaluate the battery life, etc.  The toothbrush does a good job.  It is quick and thorough.  Two minutes go by in a flash and my teeth feel clean, even cleaner than some cleanings I have had in the dentist\'s office.The timer was very difficult to open.  There are two pieces of plastic covering the battery. Instead of sliding the top cover one has to press and raise it off the appliance.  (If this sounds confusing, it is.)  The second cover slides off.All things considered, I think I will be very happy with this toothbrush.  Did a lot of research before I bought it because the last electric toothbrush I had left a lot to be desired.  This is a winner.UPDATE:  I\'ve had this toothbrush for 6 months.  3.31.11 I noticed a yellow, sticky residue on the charger that appears to be oozing from the bottom of the handle.  I called Oral-B\'s Customer Service for information re a refund or replacement, answered a questionaire and was told I would be given a call-back in two weeks????  Will update again."
1434,1466,20101030,B001CX4JSS,3,"October 30, 2010",A2R9FYRFG64NGC,Brush is too firm,"My previous brushes were a Sonicare, which I purchased when it first came out. Good, but a little clumsy and heavy. When the battery died I bought the Oral B Sonic Complete. With its battery now almost dead, I replaced it with the Pulsonic, which I thought was an advance in design. Unfortunately, the brush is too firm for comfort, so I am using it at low speed. I really prefer the Sonic Complete, which has a comfortable soft brush, so I regret the decision to buy the Pulsonic. Three stars only--it\'s OK, not good."
2699,2770,20111210,B003UKKHB4,5,"December 10, 2011",A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX,One important feature you won\'t find anywhere else,"I have read the research and know, firsthand, the benefits of an electric toothbrush over a manual toothbrush. I prefer the oral-b / braun non-sonic over the sonic models. I am a big fan of this style of toothbrush & have owned them for almost two decades. I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years) and this one is my favorite. The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \'brake light\' which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums. Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \'get all up in there\', but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful. I buy the \'extra sensitive\' heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I\'m not \'paying attention\'. Even though the other models had an \'indicator\' (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn\'t really enough to get my attention so I didn\'t reduce the pressure.When I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light - it\'s *really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall. (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom). But, the \'brake light\' was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and the light now only goes on every once in a while.They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing. This toothbrush with its \'brake light\' feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums & your teeth, and in turn, your health & well-being!PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, & healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon). I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)"

956,975,20101208,B000AUIFCA,4,"December 8, 2010",A192YXBPZ0ZB6U,Very nice brush head,"I had originally used the dual brush head that came with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and liked it very much. I had intended to order this same brush head, but the reviews on the Floss Action brush head refill intrigued me. I won\'t have definitive results until I go back for my scheduled cleaning, but the size of the head is very compatible with my smaller-sized mouth. I like the thought that I might be getting a better cleaning between the teeth, which is an area of concern to my hygienist. Stay tuned!"

1919,1964,20111220,B002HWS9G6,4,"December 20, 2011",A1JJE3N3PMKF6A,cheap but good travel toothbrush,I still prefer my Oral-B home rechargeable toothbrush as it has a stronger rotation. But this toothbrush can last a long time (new alkaline can last at least a month; brush twice daily for 2 mins) and it is a good travel toothbrush. Not bad for the price on amazon.

I could put up a video of my 10-year-old daughter squealing with delight as she used it for the first time, toothpaste and drool spraying everywhere.  I haven\'t seen her laugh that hard in a long time. In fact, the next day I realized some of the white spots on my t-shirt were NOT part of the design, but actually were toothpaste spray from my efforts to capture her on video. As electric toothbrush novices, we over-estimated how much toothpaste was needed.This toothbrush works perfectly fine.  It\'s a great way to get reluctant young tooth-brushers to do at least 2 minutes of brushing because it has a built-in timer, too.  It uses an inductive charging system so it won\'t rust and the battery holds a charge well.The only downside is that in our bathroom, it seemed as loud as a buzz-saw, but that didn\'t stop my kid from using it so I can\'t complain."

2700,2771,20111208,B003UKKHB4,5,"December 8, 2011",A9614AD0YQ4X5,Improved from older model,My wife and I bought this unit to replace an earlier version that was showing its age after 14 years.  It still had the original battery but it was showing its age in other ways.  The brush on the new unit moves much faster than the old and our teeth feel even cleaner than they did with the old one and that didn\'t feel bad at all.  The instructions suggest brushing 1/4 of the teeth at a time and the brush stutters a little every 30 seconds so that all four quadrants get cleaned equally.  I see no reason that this brush won\'t last as long as its predecessor.
127,128,20110318,B00006ANDK,5,"March 18, 2011",AN81JUYW2SL24,Gentle yet effective,"Oral B Sensitive Toothbrush HeadsThe sensitive bristles are extremely soft and also fine. In my honest opinion, the sensitive toothbrushes are generally a better way to clean your teeth. The medium to stiff bristles seem too large in diameter and stiff. These type of bristles are great for scrubbing stubborn particles, but not really that great for everyday cleaning of teeth especially when you use toothpaste that has fine abrasive particles. These brushes worked well with the sensitive mode on my Oral B 5000, although I found that my teeth didn\'t feel too bad even when using the full attack mode of the electric brush.Overall: 5/5"

After a few weeks of exclusively using this toothbrush there was no noticeable whiteness difference for my teeth. It was easy to use and there were no issues with it. I chose to return to the Sonic and will keep this one as a back up. The reason for this was due to the brush head since I had already picked up a replacement pack. I really don\'t see how one could go wrong with either brand\'s lightweight sonic model. I think in choosing it will come down to which one is on sale or even color/style preference.

Oral-B seemed to do the best job so it was a matter of finding one at the price I was willing to pay.  I priced all of the Oral-B electric toothbrushes and felt the SmartSeries 5000 was the best value.  I have used it for one month and see amazing results.  My teeth are not only whiter, but feel so much cleaner than my prior cybersonic toothbrush.  I drink coffee, tea, and red wine and now my teeth look like I have been using a whitening product.  I have used an electric toothbrush for 15 years and the Oral-B is the best at cleaning.  I was able to get the SmartSeries 5000 on sale for $104 while the SmartSeries 4000 was $20 more.

I always get a good report from the dentist, but this tooth brush is so much better than that!  This brush gives you the fresh from the dentist feel.  While the brush head is a little bit smaller than the spin brush it works great!  There is an indicator light that tells you when you are brushing too hard.  I have read some other reviews comparing this to the next model up and one of the  major differences is that the charging station and the tooth brush have the indicator light but as long as you brush in front of the mirror you can see the light on the toothbrush and if you aren\'t brushing in front of the mirror you wouldnt see the light on the base either unless you don\'t have a mirror over you sink or don\'t have your toothbrush at your sink, neither of which makes much sense!

It has two speeds and I have found the slower speed to be the most comfortable for myself.

The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision. The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure. Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums. I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.

My first thought...you just want me to buy a $100+ toothbrush that works just as well as my one at home. Of course, like a fish attracted by something shiny I hopped on the internet to take a look at electric toothbrushes. I probably spent 5 hours reading everything I could on these. A lot of people were talking about the one that has a UV cleaner in it. I call gimmick. Anyways, I ended up with this one and was extremely skeptical.1. The timer is separate from the brush and sits on your counter and has a picture of a smiling tooth on it, kind of hard not to feel like this is a joke2. What the heck, charged this puppy up and waited till after dinner3. Initiate brushing sequence4. Having the handle buzz after 30 seconds to let you know to move to a new quadrant and having it show on the timer is very useful. It makes it seem like it is going by really fast.5. If you brush too hard the handle stops pulsating till you back off. I literally put the brush head on each tooth and just move down, not really doing any real brushing but just letting the vibrations do the work.6. After I spit and rinsed out my mouth, it literally felt like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. They stay smooth almost the entire day depending on what you eat.This was $$$ well spent in my opinion. I highly recommend getting one of these. Don\'t forget, you are supposed to change your brush head every 3 months or so. Might want to price that into your purchase."

Almost all the reviews for the 1000 said the pressure sensor didn\'t work or was innefective. So I ended up getting the Vitality ($24.99) instaed of getting the 5000 ($119-149) that I would not have been as happy with. I spent hours looking for a review that told me this exact info so, you\'re welcome. This brush is fantastic, the Floss Action head can be a little aggressive so I am getting a pack of Precision heads (they are super cheap, like $14 for 3) for back ups but most days I will use the Floss Action Heads because I felt \'dentist clean\' afterwards. I did read some reviews that said the heads wrer a little large, I have a small mouth and while the heads are thicker than a manual brush it was by no means unmanageable or uncomfortable. This is a fantastic product and I am here to let you know my Sonicare is now in a landfill and I don\'t miss it one bit.

While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.ADVANTAGES:Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It\'s not the most powerful brush I\'ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.DISADVANTAGES:Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it\'s nice to have the option and this one does not.Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it\'s power would rate 3 stars.OTHER COMMENTS:Does it whiten teeth?  It\'s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.  I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me."

They should have used a nickel metal hydride or lithium ion/polymer rechargeable battery instead. Or, include an option to use regular AA batteries. Ni-Cad batteries are notoriously memory prone and don\'t really last long at all. In fact, the instructions for this unit state not to leave the charger/stand plugged in unless the unit is ready to be charged up. This is because if you charge it when it isn\'t fully drained, the battery will not last as long on subsequent charges due to the memory issue. Oral-b should be ashamed of themselves for incorporating such a lame battery in what could be a more useful product with a better internal battery.Luckily, I have an old Oral-b power toothbrush that takes regular AA batteries and the brushes from this unit fit on it! So, when the stupid ni-cad battery on this unit fails, I can use my old base and regular AA batteries but still use the dual head brush attachment.I can\'t recommend anyone buy this based on the fact that the battery is not viable. If you can find one that takes regular batteries I think that would be better for you (you can use rechargeable in that if you want)."

There is a real deal breaker here.The Good: When compared to my Sonicare, this brand actually works better at removing plaque, and I really, really like the little pick brush. It gets into tight areas and along the gum line if you need it to.The Bad: There are problems with this product though. Even on the \'sensitive\' setting, the brushing can be a bit harsh. If it didn\'t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it\'s not. I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation. This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing. Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes. Yes, this one is supposed to beep, but my didn\'t always do that.The Ugly: Then there\'s the deal breaker - the handle is so small and it vibrates so intensely in my hand that it is painful to use on a daily basis. I have carpal tunnel on the right and an old stress fracture on the left, so even though this products does what it is supposed to do very well, I will continue to use my larger grip, smoother running Sonicare on  a regular basis and this product only once in  awhile for a \'spit polish.\' I would not recommend this product for anyone with large hands, previous or current hand injury or nerve damage, or any one with arthritis."

I bought this toothbrush because of the good reviews and there was a promotion for a 1/2 off rebate.  So, I only paid $51 for it after receiving the rebate.That being said, I really like this toothbrush and am very happy that I bought it.  It makes my mouth feel so much cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.I bought my 3 yr old son and 5 yr old daughter a Philips Sonicare for kids and tried that toothbrush.  I did not like the Sonicare toothbrush at all.  The sonicare toothbrush vibrates and it made my mouth feel numb even after I was done using it.  My son wouldn\'t even try the sonicare, and my daughter tried it, but didn\'t like it.  However, my daughter uses the Oral-B every night (She still uses her manual one once a day).  She says she likes the Oral-B.  I bought her some kids replacement heads (I found them on ebay for a really good price).  She likes the smiley face that shows up on the timer after you reach the two minutes.  She even used it longer to see if it would wink at her, which it does.  She watches the timer while I\'m brushing her teeth and I have never had a problem reaching the 2 minute brushing time.The toothbrush comes with a stand and a place to put four toothbrush heads which is nice.  I have two heads in there for me and one for my daughter.  Once I can convince my son to use the toothbrush, there will be space for his toothbrush head.  I really like the different colored rings that come with the toothbrush heads so that we can keep track of whose heads are whose.I am so glad that I bought this toothbrush and would definitely recommend it to others."

It does the same job as the more expensive version and is easier to hold. It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it. Because it is lighter and thinner, I think I actually use it longer. It is also easier to find the replacement heads for it. I also think that the shape of the toothbrush makes it is easier to get at the back of the bottom teeth where the plaque is the worst. That means less time in the hygenist chair.

The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  I can\'t comment on the alleged \'flossing action\' since I still floss and I\'m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven\'t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  The things we do for oral hygiene.So yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B\'s Vitality.  That\'s just your teeth and gums howling like Westley from The Princess Bride being tortured.  Well, your teeth and gums are wimps.  They\'ll get used to it and thank you later.  Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you\'ve just had a professional cleaning.  The secret, of course is the much-vaunted circular buffing motion.  You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  Problem solved.  Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there\'s not a lot to complain about.  If you\'ve got the bucks and a hankering for oral hygiene, then you could surely do worse than to invest in Vitality."

It felt kind of crazy to spend $100+ on a toothbrush, but I had some money in a health spending account to use up. I read a lot of reviews before buying.Pros: My teeth feel very clean after using. It can reach places that a regular toothbrush couldn\'t. The construction feels pretty strong and reliable. I like the external readout, and having a clock in the bathroom is handy.Cons: Expensive.  The feel in the hand is a little big and clunky. All the various speed settings seem a little pointless...probably one or two settings would be fine. The flossing brush head doesn\'t feel like it really flosses/gets between teeth, the polishing brush head doesn\'t seem like it does anything special.  I mostly stick w/ the sensitive brush head.If it lasts me 5 years and results in good checkups, it will have been worth it."

Clearly they got the source of the stain wrong, and I\'m not so sure about the brush.My research led to the purchase of the Oral-B 3000.Oral-B and Sonicare seem the brushes of choice, and my research gave Oral-B a slight edge, though I\'m reconsidering. Reading reviews also gave the Oral-B floss action brush head a slight edge, and I\'m inclined to agree; though it certainly doesn\'t replace regular flossing, so far it seems to be keeping the staining abated.The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist\'s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. Primarily, the mode switch is a source of frustration, for the brush can not be shut off without going through all three modes. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000."

Better than sonicare essence,This simple cheap battery operated oral b toothbrush cleans really well and the batteries last a long time! I bought this electric toothbrush along with a sonicare essence brush that my dentist recommended. I noticed that if I took a toothpick to my teeth after using the sonicare I could still scrape off plaque. I could find no plaque after using the oral b and my teeth felt cleaner and smoother. My sonicare now sits in the closet and I use this brush exclusively. Doesn\'t hurt the gums either nor jar the teeth with high vibrations.I noticed a few people have remarked that getting the battery cap off is difficult. The trick is to squeeze inward on the sides with some strength first and then pull off. Don\'t pull off when you are just starting to squeeze inward.

The Braun manufactured brush comes with the recharger base and 2 floss action brush heads for under $30 from Amazon which strikes me as, perhaps, the best bargain of all available powered brushes on the market because of the high quality and effective design.I\'ve been using the Sonicare system for roughly the last three years and I do love it, but the handle is bulky and the brush heads are expensive to replace.  I always have wondered if there was anything out there that was as good or better?  Enter this system...It actually seems to clean every bit as good, maybe better, and it makes my gums feel much more \'alive\' than the Sonicare does.  Judging by sink remnants it truly does clean at least as well, if not better.  I\'m guessing the floss action heads are truly small engineering marvels as they do seem to actually do what the name implies.  The size of the head suits me well after initially getting use to it.  That, combined with the more svelte handle allows me to easily get to the back of my teeth quite easily, better than the Sonicare IMHO.It is impossible to ignore that this system comes in noticably less in cost than the Sonicare too.  I\'ll still, on occassion, use the Sonicare, but this is my new favorite because it\'s effective cleaning and I really love the better stimulated feeling of my gums.  In fact, I will just say it:  I feel my teeth are cleaner and my gums much more invigorated with this winning product.  For me there are few downsides to this unit that I can think of.  Maybe the only thing I\'d like to have seen added was a brush guard, or holder, for sliding around the brush head when traveling...Otherwise, Oral B has hit a real \'homerun\' with this product which I feel works great, I enjoy immensely, and is a decent bargain too."

Now to the point...- Quality of the cleaning - My first impression is that the feeling it leaves after you use the brush is slick and clean.  Im usually the type to brush when I can and I do religiously.  I feel this product does the job well and faster than using a manual toothbrush.- Charge - The charge last pretty much exactly what it says.  Depending how often you use it (I use mine twice-morning and night) It lasts about 10-14 days.- Timer -The quadrant timer is something that is useful as well.  I like how it \'paces\' you through the brushing.  There are times when my mind wanders and with this it gives a little pause in the vibrations to prompt you to go to the next quadrant in your mouth.- Durability -Its been about 5 or 6 months since I\'ve purchased it and it doesnt seem to have any durability issues.  When spending any more money for a high dollar item this is a concern for me.- Sound - The sound is a little bit louder than the Sonicare, but it wasn\'t a big concern for me.Overall, it was a choice between this and the Sonicare line, and I went with this after lots of research.  I like how this comes with a nice travel case so for the trips it is easy to store.  Many of the Sonicare products that is in the same price range did not.  Also the replacement heads for the brush are cheaper with the Oral B (more options to pick also)and it might not be a big deal to everyone, but I\'m sure the cost all adds up after years of use.  With all that aside, I\'m very happy with the product, because of the quality of cleaning. It says 2 minutes for a total clean, but I go the 2 minutes plus an extra 45-60 seconds and I get a better clean than manually brushing for 5 minutes plus.  I never had a \'break in\' time to have my gums adjust, which some people might need, but it was fine and gentle enough for me.  Ill never go back to manual toothbrushes again."

It is powerful and leaves your mouth feeling like you have had a good tooth and gum scrubbing and massage.  While doing a great job it is gentle enough that leaves you wanting to more.  I tend to be somewhat lax about how long I brush.  This lets you know how long to brush in increments and before long you are done.  It leaves you wanting to keep right on a brushing.

But my dentist recommended that I go electric, suggesting the Phillips Sonicare. They had plenty of MIRs and coupons. Yeah ok. Real surprise huh? I wanted something that spun to get more plaque off and clean better. I believe the Sonicare works well but you can get the Sonic attachment for the Oral-B also. After one day of using this, I am blown away. Why did I wait for this before? I feel so clean after one use. Much better than manual.I was using my iPhone app, Brushytime to time and make sure that I brush long enough but it turns out that I do that anyway. The smart guide is cool but I have left my teeth get away from me and I will take all the help I can get.I will not be buying my replacement heads from Amazon because of all the fake ones being delivered as of late."

For less than a week I did have some gum sensitivity like they mention, but after that the pain and problems went away.  I\'m amazed at how much cleaner my mouth feels and looks.  My teeth whitened a little bit at first and the overall health of my mouth improved greatly.  I will never switch back to a traditional toothbrush, even though it\'s costlier for this one and the refills.  I figure I\'ll save much more than that in the long run and just the way my mouth feels now makes it worth the cost.  The box comes with everything you\'ll need.  It had two brush heads included, a traveling case and an okay looking case for the brush heads (I still prefer to keep them in my medicine cabinet).

2265,2317,20101128,B002HWS9GG,1,"November 28, 2010",A254GK1CC24ZY2,Awesome toothbrush! Crappy Amazon Customer Service,"NOTE: The product is actually 5 stars but I\'m giving this review 1 star for Customer Service. I figured if it was 1 star... perhaps, Amazon checks the reviews and will read this! HUMPH!Regarding the product, 5 STARSI\'ve used the Sonicare E Series for years (probably almost a decade by now). I somehow managed to get periodontal gum disease about 3 years ago. My dentist found no physical cause for this (as I\'m young, do take care of my teeth and gums, and my medical exams/blood tests have all turned up fine). Anyways, after brushing my teeth with the Sonicare, I usually still see visible plague (sticky white residue) on some of my teeth/gums... no matter how much I aim the toothbrush at my gums, etc. Also, since my mouth is small, I always feel that the toothbrush doesn\'t really get the back of my four top front teeth (central & lateral incisors), due to the shape of the toothbrush. My hygienist has always favored Oral B for its smaller shape but I always thought Sonicare was the best that was out there. Anyways, I decided to switch over since our Sonicare was dying and Oral B had a 50% off promotional rebate. Sweet deal!!! After the very first use of this Oral B toothbrush, I didn\'t see any visible plaque! My next dentist appt. is in Feb., so I\'m extremely curious to see if my dentist and hygienist notices any improvements!Regarding Amazon\'s Customer Service, 1 STAR and that star is for the CS Agent #4 that assisted me (He/she really gets 5 stars... all other CS Agents get 0 stars!)So, Oral B\'s website clearly stated that the 50% off promotional rebate was valid for purchases from Sept. 1st through Nov. 30th. It also stated: \'participating online retailers will provide a printable rebate form with purchase\' and listed Amazon as a participating online retailer. However, the \'rebate forms for recent purchases\' link (at the top of Amazon\'s product description) provided us with a PDF link to an older rebate (valid for purchases by Oct. 31st). Also, when we clicked on the \'instructions\' link and followed the steps to see if any of our purchases qualified for a rebate, it came back saying that our Oral B purchase didn\'t qualify for any rebates. (We decided to go this route before contacting CS in the hopes that we could obtain the correct rebate through a different method on Amazon\'s website.)So, I contacted Amazon\'s CS via chat, tell them my problem, provided the links to Amazon\'s product page and Oral B\'s product page (for their reference) and requested that they send me the new and/or correct rebate form. Here goes my frustration:- CS Agent #1: Reads my message, puts me on hold to research, comes back and tells me that my problem is that the rebate was for purchases made by Oct. 31st and I didn\'t qualify since I purchased the product in Nov. DUH! I KNOW THAT! I proceed to resend him the link to Oral B\'s site that clearly stated the new promotion and that Amazon was a participating online retailer. CS Agent #1 tells me \'We support a wide range of mail-in offers, but this particular offer is a transaction between you and the manufacturer. If you need more help with the offer, I recommend contacting Oral B directly.\' Great. Useless. I asked for a phone number so that I could speak with someone and was provided with an Amazon CS phone number.- Called and spoke with CS Agent #2: Explained my problem, stated that CS Agent #1 was not helpful and if he could please assist. I also explained that CS Agent #1 was not aware of the new promotion, etc. etc. I was again placed on hold while he researched the issue and he also came back with the same line, \'that I purchased the product outside of the promotional offer.\' CS Agent #2 did not have internet access so I requested that he transfer me to a manager that had internet access and could see what Oral B\'s site stated.- Transferred to CS Agent #3 (who was a regional manager): He said that he was sorry that Amazon\'s website stated one thing while Oral B\'s site stated another. He can only submit my request to Amazon\'s marketing team and that they should hopefully send me the correct rebate on Monday (as I had called on a Sunday and Marketing was closed).During all this time (that I was on the phone), I was again on Amazon chat with yet another CS Agent... I figured... I must somehow be able to reach someone that understands and can assist!- CS Agent #4: I explained that I had already spoken to several people, explained my situation and asked that he/she kindly please research the links that I\'m sending before he/she comes back to tell me that I purchased outside of the qualifying promotional period. CS Agent #4 comes back and saves the day! Apparently, if you scroll further down the product page on Amazon, under \'Special Offers & Product Promotions\', is yet another rebate link... this time to the CORRECT FREAKING REBATE! YES! YES! YES! I was so thrilled that I thanked CS Agent #4 profusely. I also asked CS Agent #4 to tell the Amazon web team that the link at the top of the page refers to the old rebate, which is confusing when there\'s another link further down that refers to the new rebate.So, yes, I missed the second rebate link on the product page... but so did the first 3 Amazon CS reps! It took 4 tries to get someone competent to assist me.I also think it\'s pretty incompetent of Amazon\'s web team to 1) Not have the two rebates listed together under the same section... why have multiple rebates available on different parts of the page? And 2) when checking to see if your purchase qualified for any rebates (although a cool feature) was definitely useless in my case as it didn\'t register the fact that the Oral B toothbrush did indeed qualify for a rebate (that was apparently available after all on their website)!Phooey on Amazon for their customer service and web team.Other than this frustrating experience, I do enjoy shopping on Amazon.com... I guess it is safe and hassle free... as long as you don\'t require a rebate or customer service!"

It\'s actually a pleasure to use; I never reach for my manual toothbrush anymore. There\'s a learning curve but not overwhelming.  Once I got the hang of it, I was amazed at how simple it was - put on the brush head, apply toothpaste, press the button and enjoy.  Rinse the whole thing under water, dry and stand in its recharger.  That\'s it. It has been very effective at removing old stains - without damaging my gums - something I found hard to do with a manual toothbrush.

I like this style because you can use regular AA batteries or rechargable AA batteries (which is what I use). The charge usually lasts more than a month.

This toothbrush is far superior to regular brushing.  Your teeth feel so clean afterwards.  I recommend using this product fully and then trying the FlossAction head.  The flossaction just seems to massage my gums and clean a notch better!  Also, each head has bristles with indicators but sometimes it\'s hard to tell when to replace the heads.  Just replace them every 6-8 weeks.  Also, the unit cleans so much better with the battery full rather than low.

I really like the Oral-B because it has a small rechargeable base therefore the power of the toothbrush is consistent (unlike replacement battery units).  These replacement brush heads were a great value.  I like the \'dual clean\' since it has the revolving round bristles (on top) and the bristles that move up and down (on the bottom).  These brush heads make my teeth feel so clean that I feel like I just left the dentist office.  I particularly like that the blue bristles fade through time reminding you that it\'s time to replace the brush head (they last around 2-3 months depending on how often you brush).  No regrets buying these on-line - very competitive pricing (in fact far cheaper than retail stores) and shipping was fast.

After about 2 weeks, the battery display started to develop moisture within the display. At around one month, the display could no longer be seen since condensation had turned into large water globules that obstructed the display.With 4 uses per day by two adults, after 3.5 months, the toothbrush failed to turn on but would activate after a few minutes or sometime in the day by itself. It is apparent that the board has gone bad and the toothbrush is no longer useable reliably.Pros:This toothbrush has a holding stand that can hold up to four individual heads for multiple users, or different toothbrush heads. (Be sure to dry your toothbrush head before placing in case, or you will have a gradual soap scum build up)Multiple Settings for persons with sensitive teeth.Timer that displays vibrations by 30 second intervals for dentistry recommended minimum of 30 seconds per quadrant.Timer also displays time. (Would like to have had the timer lit since the angle is almost at 90 degrees and should be angled slightly higher by about 15 degrees more for adult use.)Cons:The price is high for what seems to be only a timer radio frequency linked display and a few lower setting for strength of brushDid not last long for something that is exposed to soap in mouth and running water when rinsedPower connection is very l;arge and takes up a lot of spaceaway from the electrical socket. (MOst people are limited to counter space in the bathroom)In conclusion, I liked the design and feel of the toothbrush but was very dissapointed that it broke on me after only a few months. A little red light displays on the timer to show if you are being to rough on your tooth enamel when brushing, which I liked but also wanted the motor to be as powerful as previous models. Maybe this was bad for my teeth, but I could feel the difference on the gum lining of each tooth when touching sliding my tongue for cleanliness.since some people have a hard time returning things, maybe this one should be bought in a store with a guaranty instead of online. I will try to contact Oral B and Amazon about a replacement, and will update this review upon their response with difficulty or ease."

Like the Smart Guide/Clock timer because I used to walk around the house for the two minutes until the pulse timer went off so I never knew if I was missing spots - now I stay pretty much on track. It is a little confusing at first but it\'s not really difficult to use. I\'m not exactly a rocket scientist so if I can do it anyone can.  There are a number of things that you have to learn and get used to and decide what the most comfortable settings are for you.  I will get a couple of the recommended brushes, especially the \'floss\' brush.  They are fairly expensive but I think they last a long time.  The unit is a tad heavy in comparison to my old Oral B, but it didn\'t take long to get use to.  I think my teeth look brighter and feel cleaner than with any other brush I\'ve ever used.

They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That\'s a real laugh.

I\'m also concerned that some of the power brushes are too powerful - my teeth get sensitive. After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I\'ve been doing pretty well with the cheap Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary). Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.It\'s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it\'s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn\'t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that\'s it. I think that when the battery dies it\'s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn\'t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don\'t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn\'t a concern for me. I\'m planning to buy this brush for my children to try. For an entry level power brush, this is a solid choice."

I think that is the least useful item in the package and nobody really wants to replace the brush with that particular one. There is floss for that purpose and visits to dental hygienists. It\'s definitely better than a manual toothbrush, when you use it correctly and not just keep it encased in toothpaste residue like slobs and leave it uncharged, unchanged for a decade. People need to understand this is not something they must use intensively three days before their dentist appointment. It\'s a personal hygiene ritual that comes with common sense."

2992,3074,20100911,B003UKR67M,4,"September 11, 2010",AAKQTXS4JOUR5,Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush,"Amazon Vines review of the Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush.The product arrived timely and was packed in a small cardboard box. The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  The brushing unit is waterproof so no worry about getting water or moisture on it. There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush. The unit uses a rechargeable battery, which the company claims can not be over charged, so you can store the brushing unit on the electric charger unit.I have used both a Phillips and Oral-B electric toothbrush and find that this rechargeable model does a comparable job in the cleaning of my teeth. I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back teeth.The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth. The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums. The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off. The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.The brushing bristles give an indication by fading in color to show when it should be replaced. I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package. Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long but it looks very similar to the brushing head I have used on my Oral-B electric toothbrush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model."

Though it took a few times to get used to using an electric toothbrush, once I got the hang of it I can definitely see a difference in my teeth.  I was using it for about two to three weeks before a dentist appointment and my dentist told me that she sees a huge difference and my teeth never looked better.  While getting a cleaning, I also noticed that the hygentist did not have to do nearly as much scraping as she usually has had to.  I definitely give this two thumbs up and is worth the investment!"

I bought two packages to take advantage of free shipping so it was like getting 6 heads for the price of 3. They were exactly what I needed for my Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush, Type 3709. They even arrived faster than expected."
2588,2648,20101009,B003UKKH6O,2,"October 9, 2010",A3FEGTOLCWXSV4,It works but is not particularly usable,"Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000). The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.In particular, note that the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per second, and does not have a battery charging indicator. All of which are present just one level up in the Professional Care 1000.To me the lack of a quadrant timer is a big disappointment - I don\'t want to be watching a clock while brushing if I don\'t  have to. The gentle thrumming of the Professional Care 1000 every 30 seconds is a very nice pacer.The brushes in the Professional Care series not only add quadrant timers, but also are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second, and have battery charge indicators.As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.Overall, I found the Vitality to be lacking features that I rely on. Hence my rating. I\'d strongly recommend that you consider the Professional Care 1000 as the minimum entry level functionality for a brush. You\'ll probably find (like I did) that you don\'t need much more than what the Professional Care 1000 has to offer.Happy Brushing!~Damodar"

Buzzing about in my mouth and definately making the gum area very clear and stimulated. A real massaging of the gums - which I know from my dentist that this is a good thing. Healthy for the gums.It was really amazing. It felt incredibly clean and especially clear of foreign materials. I am a flosser by nature as well..and I noticed after several days of usage...that my flossing showed less and less particles between my teeth. And those particles came out easier - even popcorn!What\'s really nice is it comes with and extra brush - either for use with two peeople or use one as your back up and it plugs into the wall nicely. There is no battery replacement however because it is magnetically charged the hand unit does not plug intothe wall. Free from cord or plug issues being close to water.It was packed well and comes complete with operational instructions as well as infomation on how to brush properly with it. All in all a great investment for good gums and clean teeth. Your dentist will notice the diffeence if you use it regualrly and properly I am certain of that!(Don\'t forget to floss and gargle too!)  8-26-10Just an added note...I have been using it now for two months! - I have had better check-ups, better breath and my gums \'feel\' stronger!  9-27-2010"

When we received this review copy of the Oral-B Vitality Floss-Action unit, we of course were comparing it against our Sonicare unit. So I\'ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea. It\'s now just a question of which one to get.In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh. We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it\'s doing a great job. It\'s not \'too mild\'. Our dentist praises us on how well our teeth are cared for. I don\'t see the need for the extra agitation this unit gives.There are no LEDs anywhere that we can see to indicate this unit is charging. It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn\'t being wasted.There\'s similarly no battery indicator.Finally, with the Sonicare, you get a blink every 30 seconds to change mouth quadrants. That way at the end of 2 minutes you know you\'ve handled each quadrant evenly. With this one, you solely get a buzz at the end of 2 minutes to tell you you\'re done. So you have to manage your time yourself. I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually - but there\'s many features they left out."

The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  The brush itself is cordless, although the cord on the base station would be better served if it were retractable, for space management purposes.  Oral-B claims that the rechargeable battery cannot be \'killed\' by repeated charging, so hopefully that works as advertised.  The package also comes with one replacement head, which is a value-added touch.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.Second, effectiveness.  It\'s equipped with a 2 minute timer, which indicates the suggested total brushing length.  This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner after usage, although not quite on par with visiting a dentist\'s office.  The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.The review merits the deduction of one star, due to head design.  If the head were skinnier and angled, then it could enable better access to teeth in the rear of my mouth. Overall, a very good, entry-level toothbrush from Oral-B."

But I decided to try again with my dentist\'s advice and much to my surprise I have no problems with this 5000 toothbrush. I use the \'clean\' cycle and don\'t really need the other options. The clock is useful in the bathroom and I like it to time the cleaning of each quadrant and seeing the smily face. A cute gadget and it seems to make the 2 minutes go by very fast. My teeth are exceptionally clean and have a nice feel after brushing. I never thought I would enjoy brushing my teeth, but this toothbrush has really made a difference.

However, simply miniaturizing a perfectly good product (like the full-size SonicCare) without adding more values is hardly worth anyone\'s time or money. What is more unnecessary is to sacrifice performance just to make something more, to quote another reviewer, \'aesthetically pleasing\'. When it comes to my dental health, thanks but no thanks, I will take performance any day over form. Compared to the other brushed I have used, this tiny brush definitely feels less effective. Don\'t get me wrong though, this is not a horrible brush. Had I never used any other electric toothbrushes before, I probably would be satisfied with this brush just fine. But after using/reviewing a number of different brushes from Vine program, I\'m used to that more powerful and super fast cleaning offered by the full-size models.

Yes, it has two settings but, it shouldn\'t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn\'t have to with their older model. The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting. There is also no indication that it is fully charged except by plugging it in when uncharged and timing it.  The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  I\'m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  I am now \'cost sensitive\' as I am only willing to spend so much to \'rent\' a unit for a couple of years (my older one lasted on the lower side of this equation) only to have to throw it and the useless, spare, brand new brushes I have away (it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit\'s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.On the plus side, it is very slim so it fits nicely in the hand and, I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once so, I suppose that jackhammer feeling of the brush obviously did not do any harm to the enamel as I had feared it would."

I have the more expensive model that briefly stops every 15 seconds so you know when to change quadrants in your mouth.I got this  \'Vitality Floss Action\' brush and have to say that for the money I think one would be hard pressed to find a better buy.I agree with the other positive reviewers on all the important points but most importantly to me is VALUE. This toothbrush does an excellent job of brushing and massaging the gums. Furthermore, I believe there are different specialty brush head replacements that can be purchased. It DOES have a two minute time. In my opinion this is just as good if not better than having a 15 second timer. If you just brush your whole mouth for the full two minutes you\'ll get just as thorough and perhaps more so than if you do 15 seconds peer quadrant because you\'ll have almost as much paste on the brush for the other quadrants of your mouth. With the 15 second per quadrant type of brushing, by the time you get to the final quadrant you\'ve pretty much used all the fresh tooth paste.This is a bare bones electric toothbrush. It doesn\'t come with a travel case but I love it and see no reason to spend an extra $100 for a fancier Oral B or the other leading competitor."

The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you\'ve cleaned.But... It\'s the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest\'s claims of being \'shred resistant\' fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven\'t yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can\'t even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn\'t inspire confidence.

I really can tell the difference in my teeth\'s cleanliness and shine after only three days. I especially notice the difference on the biting surfaces, which seem smoother somehow. I also notice that when I floss after using this product, there is less \'stuff\' pulled out by the floss. I take that discovery to mean that this brush really does get in between teeth to remove food that normal brushes miss.A couple of other interesting features.1 - after 2 minutes, the brush noticeably pulses to alert you that you have passed the first brushing milestone - the minimum recommended brushing time. After 2 additional minutes, it pulses you again to let you know you should stop, having reached the recommended maximum brushing time. My wife, an exceptionally conscientious brusher, was amazed at how long 2 minutes really is. She had been under brushing for a long time.2 - The recharger acts as a stand for the unit, but you do not need to keep it plugged in to an outlet. A full charge lasts at least a week or more.3 - The unit seems well engineered, is easy to hold and the brush heads that come with the unit seem to fit \'just right\' in the mouth.4 - The first time I used it, the vibration was a bit surprising. It took my 2 or 3 uses until the novelty wore off, though brushing my tongue results is still a work in process. By the way, for those worried about sensitivity to vibration, I have mildly sensitive teeth, and the vibration has caused absolutely NO discomfort to any of my teeth.5 - Some people mention in their reviews that the brush was harsh on the gums the first time that they used it. I agree that the brush is a bit stiff the first time you use it, but after 1-2 uses, they seemed to soften a bit and now the brush seems to be very gentle on my gums.My only problem with this unit is that my wife and I are going to fight over it when I travel on business...Actually, there are a couple of short comings, but these should be easy to address. First, both of the brushing heads (which are detachable) are identical. A color band or some other distinguishing mark would be helpful to people sharing the device. Also, there is no battery indicator. I found out this morning that the battery was dying, when in the period of 30 seconds, the brush went from what seemed like full power to no power at all. Recharging it for 5 minutes allowed me to finish, but that\'s not an acceptable design choice. Perhaps a small red LED or an audible chime alerting users to a low battery will make it in to future designs."
1607,1649,20080828,B001CX4JSS,3,"August 28, 2008",A1VUN4JU731CBH,Not sure...,"I have pretty much had and tested them all: The Oral-B Triumph, the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, and now the Oral-B Pulsonic. Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but the Pulsonic leaves me a bit unsure.The design of this brush is very reminiscent of the Sonicare toothbrushes, right down to the stand which always looked different on all the previous Oral-B electric brushes. This design really looks like a stripped-down baby version of the Sonicare.First of, the brush itself is extremely slim and light-weight for an electric brush. So much so that one wonders whether it can actually \'do the job\'. So after charging it the required 12 hours, I tried it out for the first time. I did not find it any different in power than the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, it felt the same.What is different is that the Pulsonic\'s manual instructs the user to move the brush over the teeth in a circular motion, very much like one is supposed to do with a manual brush. I, for one, didn\'t quite like this although I can see the benefit of doing it this way. The Pulsonic has - like the Sonicare and unlike the Oral-B Triumph - a regular (yet contoured) brush head. The shape of such a brush head makes it difficult  to sufficiently cover the entire tooth. One is always either cleaning along the gumline or more towards the bite. Using circular motion prevents that only parts of the teeth are cleaned. Yet - I have been using electric toothbrushes for so long that I have gotten used to not really having to do anything but hold the brush head to the teeth. So this is a change I am not sure I like too much.Also - these rectangular brush heads don\'t seem to work too well for me personally. I have a small mouth and find it difficult to easily brush my teeth with these brush heads, especially the insides of the front teeth. It always feels as if I can\'t quite reach all the surfaces, especially the areas along the gumline, and that leaves me wondering whether I get as complete a cleaning as I should be getting.Philips has tried to address this problem by offering a smaller brush head for the Sonicare, but Oral-B doesn\'t seem to have that. So this is not optimal for me.What I did like about the Pulsonic though is that it comes with a second \'Precision Tip\' brush head. I found this to be a great way to really get into the spaces between teeth and I give Oral-B a big thumbs-up for this one.Lastly, the Pulsonic, like the other models and brands, informs the user audibly when it is time to change to a different \'quadrant\' to be brushed, and when the two minutes recommended brush time are over.All in all this is probably a brush I will take along when travelling - the light weight but equal power output make it perfect for that, but at home I will likely stay with the Oral-B Triumph and its round brush heads. I just feel that these heads reach all areas of my teeth better and also feel more comfortable on the sensitive areas of my mouth."

I\'ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!

It almost felt like they were incorrectly assembled with parts that weren\'t designed to go together.  I had to wonder if these were even authentic Oral-B products.

The first set has lasted more than 3 months with no problems and the heads feel identical to the originals while brushing. We haven\'t used the newest set yet, but I am confident they are also genuine because they look identical to the last set of heads, which looked identical to the original heads that came with the toothbrush. Just be sure to carefully compare your replacements to your current heads each time, given all the complaints about fakes."

Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don\'t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don\'t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don\'t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.  I\'ll figure it out."

I have used the battery-only version which runs at half of the speed of the electric rechargeable; it seems to me that the extra speed does a better job of cleaning.  The battery lasts for a week or so before recharging is needed and seems to be replaceable though I have no idea of the cost.  Another dentist recommended the Phillips Sonicare but it is so much more expensive that I chose to stay with the Oral B which uses the same rotary bush system that a dentist uses to clean teeth!

However, after having received it, I\'m a little dissappointed.  It doesn\'t appear as though it\'s that big, but it feels very large in mouth.  It felt like I was trying to brush my teeth with my thumb.  I had trouble getting the brush into the far reaches of my mouth whereas before with the smaller head I had no problems.  I\'m not a small person either, I\'m 6\'1\' and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  It\'s really not that different than the standard head, it\'s just bigger.  I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  Because of this, getting the brush into every nook and cranny is now more difficult.  Also, because it is bigger, it\'s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.  I should have bought the single one just to try it out, but I was certain I\'d love the bigger one.  Oh well..."

2205,2255,20110116,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 16, 2011",A3MPOPREPBPUR9,"Amazing cleaning, wonderful quality, and great price... Very happy!","First of all, a comment on the price...This is an amazing price for the Oral-B 5000. I just saw them yesterday (Jan. 15, 2011) at my local Target store for 159.00 with no rebate offers. So, getting one here through Amazon for under a hundred is a great buy! Not only was 96.00 a great price, but mine also came with a 50% mail-in rebate offer, which was a nice surprise. So, after that I will have only paid 48 bucks! Awesome! My girlfriend also got the rebate with hers. I don\'t know how long the rebates will last, but even without the rebate, this is an excellent price, and well worth every penny!After reading all the reviews here, and talking to my dentist about it and hearing his recommendation, my girlfriend took the plunge and ordered one a couple weeks ago. As soon as she tried it, she fell in love with it. She told me how good it felt on her teeth, and how clean her mouth felt after using it, and how she really looked forward to brushing. I immediately ordered mine the same day.My first impressions on the build quality...After opening and unpacking mine, I was immediately impressed with the build quality of the unit. The brush handle is solid and seems very well constructed, and the head that holds the brushes seems strong. I fully expect this to last a long time, and hold up really well. It\'s also attractive to look at, and the batteries last a long time on a full charge.This model comes with a separate wireless display unit, that displays brushing information while you\'re using it, and functions as a clock when you\'re not brushing. It displays a timer that will countdown from 2:00 minutes, or count up depending on your preference. It also shows the quadrants of your teeth for a visual reminder to make sure you get all areas. It displays which brushing mode you\'re using, and will flash a warning if you press too hard.Is the display really necessary? Perhaps not... The brush unit will vibrate each 30 or 45 seconds to remind you to change to the next quadrant. And it will stutter when the time is up to let you know you\'ve completed the recommended time. But, it is nice to have those visual cues where you can see them easily, and it is nice to have a small bathroom clock handy. So, I really like the display unit a lot. I think it was a nice addition, and I think most people will appreciate it.My impressions on actually using the brush...I\'ve had mine only a week so far, but I love it completely! I honestly think this is one of the best investments in my health I\'ve ever made. I\'ve never taken care of my teeth like I should have, and I have several fillings to show for it. I\'ve always tried to brush at least twice a day, but they were always short, quick brushes, by hand, and not very thorough. And I never thought I would be excited about brushing, until now.Now, I love brushing. I look forward to it. I brush at least three times a day, and never less than two minutes each time. I love how long the battery lasts, so I can take it with me to work, or on trips. This brush really makes it easy to stay on top of brushing. I can feel how thoroughly each tooth is getting cleaned, and it feels good on my teeth and gums. I haven\'t experienced any discomfort using mine.After brushing, my teeth are literally squeeky clean. It really does feel like a professional cleaning. It\'s only been a week with mine, but I can already notice a difference in their appearance. I\'m excited to see how they will look after a couple months.One last thing I really like is the carrying case that comes with it. It holds the brush firmly in place, and two brush heads firmly in place. Very convenient for carrying with me.This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I can\'t even imagine going back to a manual brush. I highly recommend this, and I\'m sure you will enjoy it just as much.Hope that helps..."

I have owned each for about 8 months now and I have to say that each brush has its own pros/cons and this is her favorite.  The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior/interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes some adjustment on the part of the operator.  I found that my gums could handle the Sonicare, but my girlfriend gums are more sensitive and she uses this Oral-B exclusively.  The motion of the brush is much more softer and the replaceable brushes tend to fit right over each tooth.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  I like having the ability to brush my tongue which is much more difficult with this brush."

The original must have lasted at least 10 years, but the replacement doesn\'t look like it will hold up as well.  It works fine with the coffee maker though.Reusable filters seem to let more fine grounds and sediment through than a good paper filter and while they don\'t use paper they do require water to wash them so I don\'t know that they\'re really all that much better for the environment than a disposable filter.  If you understand the advantages and disadvantages and know what you\'re getting, this seems a fine reusable filter.  Be advised that if you have a Braun coffee maker you might need the Braun brand replacement filter as some off-brand replacement filters don\'t have the \'notches\' in the rim of the filter that you would need to fit some Braun coffee makers.The description of the product on the Amazon page that I ordered the filter from is wrong.

Upon receiving the product, it did not look anything like the original brush heads that I received with the toothbrush I bought months ago from Amazon. The primary differences were: the bristles were the wrong color(the center green was a darker translucent color instead of the opaque light green), the bristles were splayed out instead of in tight clusters, and the gray logo was much lighter. I chalked this up to maybe changes in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the first brush head I tried did not work at all. I chalked that up to manufacturing defect. The second one worked, but didn\'t quite feel right. I decided to just go with it however, and after a month the brush head became very loose. I saw the other reviews and photos and realized that I had received fake product directly from Amazon.Here is the worst part. I decided to purchase replacement heads from Walgreens retail store. I got home and realized that they were also fake product. So, then I went to Target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine. I was floored to find fake product in a retail chain store as well as at Amazon.So, TLDR buyer beware of fake product when ordering online or shopping at retail. Look at the brush heads carefully before you make your purchase. It seems like there is a major counterfeiting problem right now and it hopefully gets resolved soon."

Because of this I\'ve used the old fashioned manual brushes that did a reasonable job of keeping my teeth clean. Well, this tradition is about to change.After using this brush, my teeth have a smooth and polished feel all the way down to just below the gum line! Amazing! Even my manual brushes don\'t do as thorough a job. Also, the brush charges through induction which means that it\'s waterproof and has no wires or metal contact points that need to be protected from water. This is very cool.I could only find one minor downside to this brush which is that the head is somewhat thick. What I mean is that the distance between the bristle tips and back of the head makes it necessary for me to open my mouth fairly wide  to get the brush the tops of my rear molars. This isn\'t a challenge for me but it might be for someone with a smaller mouth.I guess I can summarize my review by saying that I\'m tossing out my manual brushes because this is now my personal favorite. Heck, I might even brush more often because I like the feel of clean, polished teeth!"

They are something that I happen to know very well. The product that I received came in a packaging that while different from what I am used to, still had the OralB logo, that I was familiar with. I figured that maybe there was just a difference in packaging for online markets. Well I guess that I should have questioned things more because I am convinced that I could not have received authentic OralB Floss Action brush heads. The brush heads I got all broke very soon after beginning to use them. I usually get about three months from each brush head as is indicated on the packaging for the heads. With these here, the brush heads all started coming loose easily move back and forth after only a few weeks. This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing. That was not enjoyable! I would say that these brush heads were either some kind of knock-off, or maybe someone found a way to sell the brush heads that were rejected in production.

This brush does a great job of thoroughly cleaning your teeth w/o hurting your gums.  The timer that directs you to switch from one quadrant to another, every thirty seconds is a good reminder.  And the red light that flashes when too much pressure is applied is quite handy.In addition to switching my toothbrush, I also changed my toothpaste to Jason\'s Healthy Mouth.  After using the new toothbrush & toothpaste for approximately three months, I visited my Hygienist for a cleaning.  Unprompted, she told me that I had the healthiest teeth/gums of any of her patients.  And that assessment still holds true after almost two years.One last note:  If you\'ve got a youngster who needs to learn to brush all quadrants w/o applying too much pressure, purchase an extra toothbrush head and let your child give it a try.

I have taken it on trips up to 5 days and the charge holds fine without recharging.My only criticism is that sometimes when I am holding the handle I will accidently press the button that switches to the next brushing mode.  So I have to make sure I hold the handle low enough.  The handle may be made for a man\'s larger hand whereas with my hand I would like to hold it a little closer to the brush, but that is when I can hit the button.I would definitely buy this again."

That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that\'s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it\'s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you\'ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It\'s not like they\'ll go stale in the linen closet.Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.Hints:Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you\'re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you\'re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you\'ll do a serious \'eewwww.\'  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.  This is important.Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger. This will make that weekend maintenance simpler.That\'s it! Now get one for yourself and see."

The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days.  3 days is the new norm. That\'s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger.  It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference.  After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it\'s smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."
2840,2915,20100916,B003UKM90Q,4,"September 16, 2010",AEVSRK7S3K8QU,Perfect Price Point for an Electric Toothbrush,"I\'ve been looking at the more expensive electric toothbrushes -- Sonicare, and higher end Oral-b -- for quite some time, but could never pull the trigger when for the same price, I can practically buy a lifetime supply of manual toothbrushes.  I\'d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it\'s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you\'re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.I have one implant, and some \'erosions\' on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it\'s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.Don\'t throw away that manual toothbrush, though.  There is still one mouth maintenance chore that the Oral-b does not handle well -- brushing of your tongue.  The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \'tooth\' brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  If you check my other reviews, you\'ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed."

There\'s not.Although the package claims that the toothbrush cleans between teeth, you\'ll definitely still need to floss. I flossed after brushing, and I would say that there was less crud between my teeth than when I use a regular toothbrush, but there was still some (especially the back teeth; there was hardly any in my front teeth).I would definitely recommend this toothbrush, as long as you\'re OK with its intensity.

We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist\'s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn\'t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn\'t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don\'t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn\'t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth."

The reviews and the rebate attracted me to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. I especially liked the polishing mode, since I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth. I didn\'t think that I\'d use the clock/timer/sensor, but I decided to put it up to have a small clock in my bathroom. I\'m using it all of the time! I give my teeth a \'spa treatment\' - floss, polish, massage gums...and feel like I\'ve had a professional cleaning. Having always been a diligent brusher, I was surprised to see that I could benefit from the reminder to brush each of the four areas for 30 seconds. The little warning light that tells me when I\'m exerting pressure (and thus brushing too hard - all you have to do is hold the brush up to the surface of the tooth and let it do the cleaning) is useful for breaking a bad habit that seems to crop up in the same place quite often.I even like the smiley face as a reward for good brushing, although I usually tend to be rather jaded about such things. I think that I\'ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. And I\'m also glad for the travel case since I hated to make trips without my Bruan (you just can\'t got back to manual brushing after you\'re brushed this well), but I\'d find that the \'on\' button sometimes got pressed in my luggage and used up the charge. The base for the Oral-B is also small enough to pack easily."

The toothbrush works well, is well designed, and seems very durable so I\'m pleased.  I wasn\'t sure if a hundred dollar toothbrush was for me, as I was in the practice of using a regular toothbrush for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time (while I surfed the net, usually), so I thought I was doing ok.  Let me tell you, this Oral-B feels AWESOME and it really makes my mouth feel cleaner in a shorter period of time!  I tried using my old toothbrush again, just to see, and it didn\'t feel right.  I\'ll never go back!!I usually use the regular (30 seconds per quadrant) clean in the morning and the extended (45 seconds per quadrant) clean at night.  After the last alert goes off I usually spend about another minute or so hitting the tongue, roof and cheeks, as well as a quick run around the base of the teeth and gums.  Feels great!As far as cleaning the brush, I let it run for a little under running water, then I remove the brush head and rinse the inside.  I then dry both using a towel, then keep them separate to air-dry a little more.  So far that keeps me from worrying about stuff growing inside or anything like that."

The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I\'d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a \'recognized name\' in oral hygiene (for whatever that\'s worth), and it\'s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).Since I don\'t have firsthand experience with other moto-brushes, I can\'t write a comparative review, but I CAN comment on this product\'s effectiveness in comparison with regular brushes, and that comparison is altogether favorable. Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before. This model features a two-minute timer, which is helpful. It\'s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well (I use it twice a day, and only need to charge it about once every eight days).Oral-b manufactures a variety of different heads for the Vitality line, and though I\'ve not tested the different varieties to see if they have markedly different results, I like the fact that the product is so well-supported; it means I probably won\'t soon find myself owning an obsolete brush for which I can\'t get replacement heads. The heads are sturdy, too, lasting me about three weeks or a month each.Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn\'t do things I don\'t need it to, doesn\'t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support.

On my old Braun electric toothbrushes the head rotated and oscillated, on this toothbrush the head pulsates or vibrates.Is it any better? The shape of the toothbrush head seems better designed to fit the shape or your teeth, and it is larger than the old design, large enough to cover two teeth. But while the head is larger in surface area it is much slimmer in profile so it is much more comfortable to use, it feeling much smaller in the mouth. I also like the timer function, it has an overall two minute timer, but it gives a signal every 15 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth.I like this new toothbrush, it seems as efficient as the old style Braun but is much more comfortable to use, and it is a little quieter too. It is also much easier to clean their being no inner workings as on the old style heads, which I am sure must be much more hygienic too.As the toothbrush should run for a week on a single 14 hour charge it is not necessary to replace the toothbrush on the charger after every use, so the charger does not need to be in the bathroom. Using the toothbrush this way should prolong the the life of the rechargeable battery tooHowever, as yet their does not appear to be an Interspace toothbrush head (which I need to reach awkward spaces) available to fit the toothbrush, so at the moment I am using both the old, with the Interespace head, and the new.

I just started using it and it definitely has some extra power that my old one didn\'t have.  It is a bit loud, so if you have sensitive ears, be warned of that.  It charged fast and is holding its battery power well (I don\'t charge it every time I use it).  I brush for 3 minutes and use the 30 second timers for back, top/bottom, right/left, then the extra minute for my front top and bottom... I thought I would hate the 30 second timer and find it annoying, but turns out its really handy to brush each of the areas long enough.  I haven\'t used the little clock thing as I tend to walk around as I brush, but I imagine it would be good for those adjusting to electric toothbrushes and/or kids.  I also probably won\'t use the extra brush holder as my medicine cabinet doesn\'t have the room.

Oral B has discontinued the Sonic line.  So, I tried the Professional Care/Smart Series - what an improvement!  I like it much better than the Sonic Complete.  It brushes much more thoroughly.On the downside, it is a bit louder (not a big deal) and the RPM drops noticeably as the days go by until I recharge it.  (I don\'t leave it in the charger after every use, only when the battery is almost dead).I went with the 5000 over the lower models because the price was insignificantly higher at the time.  I will admit that I don\'t use the advanced features that the 5000 has over the lower models.  The massaging and other brushing modes don\'t impress me; I just use the regular mode.  (I used to use the soft mode on the Sonic Complete, but I don\'t have a problem with the aggressiveness of the regular mode in the 5000).

My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why. Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:- practically no assembly required, it\'s ready to go out of the box- comes with a deck for the charger and slots for 4 heads. Storing the head keeps it cleaner, and you can use this brush for the entire family - just get different color heads and you\'re set.- all you have to do is move the brush around, no pressure needed. In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.- the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles- I love how sensitive the power button is. With CrossAction, I had to jam the button to get the brush going. With the 3000, you literally just tap it.- the brush takes about 17 hours to charge fully, and last for a week. However, I just keep it on the charger all the time since you can\'t overcharge it.The only thing that I\'m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space.

Oral B did a pretty good job of ripping off the Sonicare technology.  What  I did not like is that the Oral B didn\'t shut off automatically after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, plus the shutoff button accumulates toothpaste runoff in the process, which can be kind off gross to turn off.  Maybe it is the shape of the Oral B brush, but it sometimes felt like it missed those hard to reach places too.  Still a decent product with a decent price.  If I had it to do over though, I would probably spend more money and buy the Sonicare again."

It has 2 speeds, a charger base, a regular brush head and a small head to do in between teeth. It is a very nice design and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because it doesn\'t sit firmly in the base and is easy to knock it out of the base, it wobbles when bumped lightly. I also feel the brush head could be slightly smaller but the size is OK, I just like the smaller brush heads. It says the charge will last for about 4 hours which is good since brushing teeth only takes about 2 minutes. This is a very nice pulsing toothbrush for a little less money than some that works well.

Great product!I\'ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in it\'s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I\'ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don\'t know what they\'re talking about. I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down. Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.Don\'t hesitate to purchase a Pulsonic. But shop around for replacement heads. I found there\'s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive. However, this Pulsonic has two speeds, and she has found the slower speed to be perfect for her.Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he\'s happy with it too.

526,537,20100105,B0002KHU3I,4,"January 5, 2010",A1P948LMDI28W4,Great product though not perfect,"Being an engineer, I did extensive research before buying an \'automatic\' toothbrush, and wound up selecting the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  The Oral-B has one huge benefit over the SoniCare I was considering and that was the rotary action since the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750 also has \'sonic\' pulsations.  A lower-end Oral-B had the dual-action brushes, but wasn\'t \'sonic\'.  Did a bit more research on the Oral-B website and found this dual-action brush head to be compatible with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  This was just another huge advantage of the Oral-B over the SoniCare automatic toothbrush.  Since these dual-action toothbrushes weren\'t too expensive, I took a gamble and brought three 3-packs.  This was about 4-months ago, and I\'m still using the first one from my purchase.I definitely felt a cleaner difference from the dual-action brush head than the rotating brush head that came with my Oral-B.  The lateral vibrating brush not only help loosen gunk from your teeth, it also provides the surface area for the toothpaste, and an additional \'sonic\' surface.  With just the rotating brush head, I generally cannot finish brushing within the two-minute recommended brushing time and take at least 4 minutes.  With the dual-action brush head, I\'m able to do it in 2-minutes and my mouth feels much cleaner.  And my teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter.  I had cavity filings that were colored to match my yellowish teeth, and now I can clearly see that my teeth are a much whiter shade than my filings.  (This was without change in toothpaste, and actually reduced time in brushing).So what can be improved?  Three things.  One is the dual-action brush head is a bit thick, although not much thicker than the regular rotary brush heads.  Would be nice to have a flatter profile.  Second is that flossing action bristles should come on the rotary part of the dual-action brush head (like that on the rotary brush that came with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750).  And third, and the most important, is that the rotary part and the lateral vibrating parts of the dual-action brush head should be angled about 10 degrees to contour fit the curve of one\'s teeth.  This will optimize the contact surface at any time we\'re gliding the brush during brushing.  With these improvements, I would give it 5-stars... food-for-thought for any Oral-B employees reading this."

My gums were bleeding and slightly tender.This is not a bad thing! Plainly put,the toothbrush delivered an efficient clean. My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.Since I keep the toothbrush in my bedroom (not enough outlets in the bathroom) I charge it only every other night.

After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can\'t see because it\'s inside the column. It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next day.The directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable. I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000% markup.I tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.Caveat emptor."

Yes, the Floss Action heads are a bit bigger, but I think that suits me fine, and you\'ll probably be down with it too unless you\'ve got really small teeth.I think this is the question you should ask yourself: Do you usually prefer soft/medium bristle toothbrushes, or do you tend to seek out the firms? I\'m a firm guy, thus I prefer the Floss Action heads. The yellow rubber bits gives these heads a hardness that I love and I feel like it cleans my teeth better.

This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives. While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.Second thing to note, this shouldn\'t be a flossing replacement. You\'d think it\'d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely unnecessary.Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.So, with that, you\'d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right? Well, maybe not. For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn\'t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush. I don\'t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn\'t feel radically different from using a medium bristle brush.These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth clean.Finally, these heads seem to fit my teeth perfect, but I should note, I have a large mouth and large teeth. As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they\'d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/mouths.All in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone."

Okay, so I am not so old that I actually talk that way, but sometimes change is hard.As this is my first powered toothbrush, I cannot offer any comparison to models of old, but I can tell you that using the Oral-b 3000 is surely a different experience from just plain old brushing. First off, the round head shape definitely seems to do a great job of cleaning teeth; its shape allows for the bristles to envelope the tooth and I can feel its cleaning efforts at work. And, for those of you who have a tendency to scour their teeth with a toothbrush and scrape off the enamel, the Oral-b 3000 comes with a pressure sensor that will warn you when you are using too much force.Overall, my mouth feels cleaner after just a few days of use and I can tell it will likely make a difference in my dental hygiene.Something to note... If you have a high fear of dentists and their tools, then you should be aware that using the Oral-b 3000 will sound like you are in the dentist\'s chair.

My mother works for a dentist and was given the Oral-B Triumph toothbrush that she didn\'t like so she gave it to me to try and that\'s when I bought these replacement heads. I got the bigger head becuase I didn\'t think I\'d like the round one, plus it looked more like the sonicare one I was used to, but it turned out to be quite large, larger than expected. It\'s been a couple months now and I\'ve gotten used to it. My teeth feel clean, just don\'t know if it\'s getting my back teeth as well as a smaller head.

I use it about twice a week, and it makes a visible difference in cutting down and reversing my bad habits of lots of tea, coffee and cigarettes (far fewer of the latter than I used to, but still partake to a certain extent).I\'ve tried using UltraBright with other Oral-B brush heads and while it still works to remove stains, the Pro White works better and quicker.Worth the cost charged."

Ths brush is relatively inexpensive, but it also feels inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.Pros:-It works. The product came out of the package, charged, and worked without a fuss. The worst part of setup was the anti-theft plastic package.-Inductive charging base. The case is 100% waterproof sealed, and power is drawn by setting the brush on a holder base so that power is transferred with no risk of electric shock. Very nice.-The brush pulses a couple of times to let you know when you\'ve done your time. Brilliant.-And it comes with an extra basic brush head.Cons:-Rattles your head like a jackhammer, negating most of the positives the moment it touches your teeth. The motor is relatively slow and cheap, so until you\'ve used it for a while and learned to adapt you\'ll be concerned that it\'s going to knock your teeth out before you\'re done cleaning them.-Standard brush head is only okay. You get the most basic brush head out of the box, which to me feels only so-so for cleaning. I sometimes have to run my brush for an extra cycle to feel really clean.Overall, if you want to try a power brush but you don\'t have the money for a more expensive model, this isn\'t a bad choice- it\'s still better than a manual brush. However, in the realm of power toothbrushes, you can and should do better. When you weigh a lifetime of painful dental cleanings and potential surgical issues from cavities against the (hopefully) one-time investment in a good power brush, there\'s really no reason to stick with an underpowered model like this that\'s going to rattle your teeth like it does.However, I\'m still going to be reusing this model for a long time to come- craft and cleaning experts know that there\'s nothing like a cheap power toothbrush for doing tasks like detail cleaning leather. For this application, this is an absolute wonder of a brush. It\'s cheap, and all the jackhammering works just fine when it\'s done on something other than your head."

Most of them work pretty well. This one however, works wonders! If you\'re thinking that the timer/sensor is gimmicky... you\'re wrong. It comes with an adhesive backer so you can stick it to your mirror (or wherever you brush your chompers). I used be the person who brushed for maybe 30 seconds. But with the timer, you can\'t help but feel like crap for quitting early. It tells you how long you\'ve been brushing, the battery level, if you\'re brushing too hard, which zone you should be brushing, and what mode you\'re in. AWESOME! The battery lasts for about a week, but if you\'re on a longer trip you can take the charge out of the base (it\'s tiny) and pack it with you. There are tons of different brush heads and different brush modes, depending on what you\'re trying to accomplish. I got this toothbrush last September and have had two dentist cleanings since then. Both times they have remarked that I\'m doing an excellent job brushing, have no signs of cavities, and have the healthiest gums they\'ve ever seen. Love this toothbrush.Recommended: Definitely"

The timers is a plus which guides you and even tells you if your pressing too hard. I first bought this a while back ago but didn\'t want to write a review until I fully tested it out for a several months. I bought mine from Oral Care Deals so this review is from their product, and I was very pleased by them. One thing that I absolutely LOVED about this toothbrush was its ability to change the brush tip, which also comes with colored rings that you can identify which person it belongs too. I initially was looking for an electric toothbrush for me and my husband but when i came across this one i found out that we can both use it and all we have to do is to change the brush tip. It comes with a brush tip holder that you can place 4 tips one, so basically 4 people can use this one brush, now thats awesome by itself! We found that the battery is long lasting so you don\'t need to charge it after a few brushes. the grip is comfortable and its easy on the wrist! every time I brush I get the same feeling as i do when i go to my dentist for my six month cleaning. My dentist even said this is the best one on the market right now. Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well. bottom line don\'t hesitate to buy this model (dental professional exclusive 5000 series) because it an investment that will pay off."
149,152,20100705,B00006ANDK,2,"July 5, 2010",A3EKC0CWQQRXPJ,Unsanitary!!!,"I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care electric toothbrush set with these Oral-B Sensitive brush heads for over 4yrs now.  I GENERALLY am a review & research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I\'ve read reviews on but I went in for a dental appointment years ago and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding & inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers so I was sold! I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn\'t compare any former experience and simply didn\'t know any better.  I DO have to say that other than my \'unsanitary\' concern about these that I\'ll get to in a moment, it\'s great! I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard, it\'s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine, I have never had any \'break\' or get wobbly on me, there is a color indicator where the blue area on your toothbrush gets lighter over time to let you know when it\'s time to swap out your toothbrush, etc.Let me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it\'s clean & smells good, my home is clean - in fact I\'m actually somewhat of a germaphobe so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  I know it\'s odd to point all that out but I didn\'t want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  :-).No matter WHAT I do...I\'ve tried using bottled water to brush my teeth thinking it\'s our tap water (it\'s not...my kids & hubby don\'t have an issue w/ their toothbrushes); I\'ve tried switching to a different toothsoap / tooth powder / toothpaste - and I STILL have the same issue.  My hubby & dentist have confirmed that I don\'t have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth so it\'s not in my mouth...so I\'m left to think that is DEFINITELY the DESIGN of Oral-B toothbrush replacements heads!!!Humor me for a minute and do a \'zoom\' on the picture of Oral-B replacement toothbrushes in the middle of the toothbrush handle.  There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle while brushing then certainly a mixture of that & water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets in.I DO make a habit of actually removing my brush head in running water and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks & on the bottom where you place the charger) AND on the toothbrush head itself - both on the brush area and on & inside the handle and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide & a clean washcloth (since I didn\'t know where the smell was coming from) AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  It does NOT happen when I take all of these precautions but in my opinion, I shouldn\'t HAVE to do this in order to avoid the musty smell...musty stench means that bacteria is harboring & growing so to stick something filled with germs to \'clean\' with is not the best option in my opinion.FYI: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it\'s not me and sure enough, it\'s not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn\'t have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I\'m currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it\'s a design flaw in the brush design.I\'d rather not have to worry if my toothbrush is growing bacteria or not, I want to simply rinse the brush & handle after each use and store it away like I\'m supposed to be able to do.  I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  I don\'t understand how anyone else hasn\'t complained about this issue - maybe I\'m taking care of them wrong but I\'ve even called the company and it was suggested that maybe it was our water or toothpaste...when I told her that my other family members didn\'t have this issue, she was at a loss.For those who are also looking & comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it\'s more dome shaped so the toothpaste \'gunk\' from brushing & rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the \'dome shape\' vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle & electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B\'s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it\'s hard to get in small areas of your mouth."

They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you\'ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn\'t work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife\'s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you\'re used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I\'m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn\'t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I\'ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I\'m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit."

After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.-----THE GIST OF IT---------I\'m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that\'s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn\'t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It\'s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn\'t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn\'t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It\'s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.-----ENDING------Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won\'t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won\'t do it.  They\'ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.Lastly, I don\'t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes."

Then I could alter the behavior so that the timer takes into account that I need time to rearm the brush with toothpaste between sides.  I could also adjust the timer so that it tells me to switch quadrants after each minute rather than 30 seconds.  Heck, I could do a whole bunch of useful things with the timer unit if I could install my own apps on it.  Definitely a wasted opportunity as the timer unit is only good for maintaining discipline and encouraging kids as it is now.Still, this is a fine product."

It is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I\'ve owned, and my last one lasted 13 years. When it started to loose its charge while I was brushing my teeth I looked at what was available and decided on the 5000.I like that it has a space to store 4 brush heads, so I won\'t have to search for where I placed the extra ones when its time to change it. Also, the contour of the handle is very nice.On one of the reviews I read before I bought it, someone was unhappy with the timer. It\'s a nice, waterproof digital clock and you do not have to sync it up with the toothbrush if you don\'t want to. I did so I could tell when I\'m applying too much pressure. If you do use the timer, at 2 minutes you get a smiley face, and at 2 1/2 minutes it winks at you.The one thing I don\'t really like is that every 30 seconds it pulses to let you know to move to the next area of your mouth, but I do not brush my teeth in sections like they want you to. I asked my Dental Hygienist, who also uses one, and she doesn\'t do it their way either.She also recommended that I leave the handle off the charger until the charge wears down. The toothbrush has a \'Smart\' battery and she has heard of people having problems with the battery not holding a charge if it is keep constantly charging. The handle shows how much charge the battery has so I only charge it once a week or so.The travel case that comes with it is another nice feature. Since it holds a charge well, you can take a weekend trip, or a week, if only one person is using the handle, without having to pack the charger. There is room for two brush heads in the travel case."

All I used was the floss action brush head.After using the Oral B continually for about 3 months, I can say that the (oral B) delivers a much more powerful clean. Though the Sonicare was easier to reach the back teeth.  Both delivers a clean, smooth just left the dentist feeling.This thing is way thicker then my old Sonicare E series handle, the pictures on amazon don\'t show the side shots.  And compared to the latest and greatest sonicare, it\'s probably double the thickness.  Go to your local retail store to compare, if thin is in for you.The smartguide clock thing is pretty heavy and thick as well, keep that in mind if you want to find some way of wall mounting it.  If you have it free standing on your sink its hard to read unless your eye level (I\'m 6 3) or stand back a foot or two.  And , although some of the back is rubberized, it won\'t lean against your wall without falling.  I use fun tack to overcome this.  It comes with two sets of AA batteries, which was pretty worrysome to me because most companies don\'t even give one set but it is still going strong.  It\'s neat to know how far in you\'ve brushed and when to switch quadrants, and the \'studder\' helps better then the audible sound the sonicare makes. Smartguide will count up and down for you.Brush heads seems much cheaper then my sonicare.  A 6 pack in my local warehouse club costs $30.  About $15 for a 3 pk on Amazon, and even cheaper with subscribe and save.It charges a bit quicker then my sonicare.  The charger base is really tiny, takes up very little room.  It even snaps into the included 4 user toothbrush tray.  However, even when it\'s done charging the wall wart (power brick thing) stays slightly warm (warmth=energy consumption), so I\'d advise you to unplug after charging.."

2111,2161,20110424,B002HWS9GG,3,"April 24, 2011",A1VUN4JU731CBH,Tedious Timer,"Having had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and liking it, I was looking to get another Oral B when the time came to replace it. I decided on this model because it had the separate timer - something I had come to really miss on my older model. It had the timer on the handle only, making it impossible to check during operation. And while it buzzed after each 30-second segment was up, I often didn\'t really remember whether it had already buzzed to signal that the full two minutes had been reached and kept brushing longer than that.But it turned out that the separate timer on the Oral-B 5000 is all around tedious to operate. First, one has to remove the timer stand, then the battery cover because the buttons to set the timer are hidden underneath the cover. Whether this was a misguided attempt at keeping the design minimalist I don\'t know. But having to fumble with this already didn\'t work for me - I can\'t help but wonder: What were they thinking?In the end, the timer never worked anyway - it is set to demo mode when one takes it out of the box, and the buttons in the battery compartment also serve to set it up for regular operation. Trouble was that my timer could not be reset to normal operation. It kept cycling through demo mode time and again until I gave up and returned the whole thing.As to the toothbrush itself, it seemed to work great, just as I was used to from the previous model (and the only reason I gave this 3 stars at all). But since I had gotten this particular one because of the timer, I decided to order the 4000 model instead and just put up with the timer in the handle - at least I know this will work.One last word: My old Oral-B toothbrush came with a nice, very sturdy fabric case. This one in contrast has a rather flimsy plastic travel case. Another disappointment. My conclusion: Too expensive for what it offers."
2187,2237,20110128,B002HWS9GG,4,"January 28, 2011",A2T7P7ZL7RLGB7,Good Product,"I am a first time electric toothbrush user.  But, according to my hygienist, I am a plaque producing maniac so it was suggested to me by her that I get one of these things.  The initial price shocked me but with the rebate, I could swallow spending a net of $50 on a toothbrush.  So far, I like it.  Not sure why anyone would \'need\' the little timer/clock thing that comes with it and I wouldn\'t suggest anyone spend extra money to have this feature. I have banished mine to a drawer as I do not have unlimited space in my bathroom. The toothbrush itself is a little bulky, but after a week or so, you get used to it. One of the features I do really love is the vibrate indicator.  After 30 seconds, it vibrates to tell you to move on to the next quadrant in your mouth.  What I am astounded by however (and kicking myself in the butt over) is the price of replacement heads.  I never thought to check on that before I bought this.  It costs about $25 for a 3 pack or about $12 for a single.  Also, I have yet to find a 3 pack that is a multi pack (i.e. different heads).  So, if you are like me, and use both the polishing and cleaning head, just using this toothbrush will cost about $9 every month to replace the heads.  As for how well it cleans...I am a smoker and a coffee drinker. I am also obsessed with clean teeth so I get mine cleaned by my hygienist every 3 months.  My teeth feel cleaner since using this toothbrush and if this toothbrush allows me to expand my dentist visits to every 6 months, the cost of the unit and replacement heads will be worth every penny (as I have to pay out of pocket for 2 cleanings a year b/c insurance only covers a cleaning every 6 months)If not, then I will be happy feeling as though I have cleaner teeth but will check this purchase off as a luxury and a \'want\', not a need. One other thing that I would like to point out is that, if, like me, you have limited bathroom space and outlets, this toothbrush is wonderful b/c you only have to charge it once a week. I was very concerned over where this unit was going to \'live\' as I need my bathroom plugs for my hairdryer and flat iron.  I do not leave the base sitting out and I do not constantly charge it. I keep the toothbrush in a drawer in the case (which is very nice) it comes with and simply charge it overnight every sunday."

The Oral-B power toothbrush easily cleans the hard-to-reach areas of your teeth, removing more plaque than an ordinary toothbrush. Users will see a clear difference within the first few brushings.One thing to note, however, is that this toothbrush has a fairly long cord. So, depending on your bathroom sink area and outlet setup, you may run into the same problem I did, of the cord crossing the entire sink and getting in the way of the other things on the surface.

Been an Oral B user for over a decade,"Oral B SmartSeries 5000The Oral B 5000 is the top of the line electric toothbrush. I used to have an older Oral B from the late 1990s that worked well up until the point where I couldn\'t find it around my house. The Ni-Accu battery pack was running strong and I could have used it for another 5-10 years. Then I got a few Oral B Vitality units from the dentist for free, which use inferior Ni-Cd batteries and have a battery life of about 3-5 days with regular usage. My old Oral B could last 3 weeks on a single charge.The cool aspect of these Oral B units is that a lot of their brushes are compatible. The Precision Clean, Sensitive, Polishing, and new Floss Action are interchangeable with a few exceptions  (like the Cross/Dual action garbage). The Floss Action worked horribly in my Vitality, but seems to work incredibly well with this SmartSeries 5000. I think it has to do with the RPM/speed of the motor. The Vitality comes across as grindy/noisy when it is operating, while the SmartSeries 5000 is smoother and faster.While brushing in the Daily Cleaning or Sensitive modes with the 5000, the Floss Action brush really works to clean my teeth and gumline. It doesn\'t hurt like it did with the Vitality! The Precision Clean brushes are probably the de-facto standard, but I invite you to try the Floss Action heads just to see how it feels. I also have the Sensitive brush heads that I want to try later on. I can tell you for a fact that my teeth felt cleaner brushing with the same Floss Action head on the Smart Series 5000 versus using the Vitality or a regular tooth brush.What does the Smart Series 5000 offer over other brushes? Well, the 5000 has a LCD indicator on the unit itself to tell you the battery\'s state of charge. Neat gimmick, but I have wondered in the past whether my toothbrush was good to go in terms of state of charge. Wonder no more, because you get a bar graph indicator!The 5000 has 2 buttons: one to turn on/off and another to select different cleaning modes. It defaults to daily cleaning (same as Deep Cleaning), and progresses to feather/sensitive, massaging, polishing, and deep clean. The Deep Clean changes the timer to increase the amount of time for your brushing, but it is the same speed as the daily cleaning mode. The timer defaults to counting up, and fluctuates the brush head speed every 30 seconds to tell you to switch quadrants in your mouth, and does the typical Oral B twitch at 2 minutes to tell you that you\'re done.The wireless timer/clock module is a neat gimmick offered on the 5000 and not the 4000. I don\'t find that it is particularly mandatory, but It does have a clock and changes to a timer when you use the brush. It also lights up a red LED if you press too hard on the brush head while brushing. While experimenting, I found that you really had to jam down on the brush head to cause it to cut power to the brush. Chances are you\'re not brushing hard with an Oral B because you want the RPM\'s to do the work with the brush. I tried SonicAire and other products, including Oral B\'s cross-action, but found the traditional Oral B to be the ultimate.The Smart Series 5000 comes with 1 Floss action head and 1 polishing head. The bristles are also indicators, you\'re supposed to change them when the blue color disappears halfway down. I find that this generally occurs every 6 months, and you can order new heads from Amazon for a lot less than buying them in stores (usually).The Smart Series 5000 also comes with a plastic hard travel case, and a slim charger unit that is more of a ring than a peg like on the older models. This makes cleaning a lot easier. The included battery is a NiMH cell, which means it has a much higher capacity than NiCd and doesn\'t suffer the memory effect. I am going to keep the Vitality as a travel brush, so if someone from the hotel nicks the Vitality, it\'s not a big loss.The Smart Series 5000 is a very smart investment for your personal dental hygiene. I brush with Oral B at least once a day (at night before I go to sleep). My dentist and hygienist always mention how clean my teeth and gums look, so the Oral B must be doing its job!Overall: 5/5 starsUPDATE: 4 MAR 2011After running the Oral B Smart Series 5000 without charging it, I noticed that I can easily get 10 days of normal routine usage (2-3 times a day for 1 person) before the battery meter starts blinking with 1 bar remaining. I used it for about 12 days and estimate I can get another 2-3 days before the battery is totally drained. As someone that travels routinely for business, I can opt to not bring my charger along for week long trips because I know the battery can last at the least 10 days before needing a charge. I\'d push it as far as 15 days!UPDATE: 19 NOV 2011I decided to push the Oral B 5000 as long as possible without charging it to see what would happen. After 22 days, it was still running fairly strong. I can detect a decrease in RPM because the voltage is probably too low. So that is roughly 44-60 minutes of total run time.

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  The number after the dash (for example EB17-3) just means how many toothbrush heads you\'ll be receiving.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads."

1508,1543,20090924,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 24, 2009",A1OZA52DFY3SHD,"Good for your teeth, better for your gums","The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great product at a pretty good price, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s perfect.I\'ve been using an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush for about 4 years now and I really like it.  The Oral-B Professionals have the circular brush head and work differently than the Pulsonic or Philips\'s Sonicare toothbrushes.  Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I\'m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.The Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  It\'s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  The brush head of the Pulsonic is a breeze to take on and off; you slide it onto the unit and then give it a quarter-twist.  The brush head locks into place.  I hate how the brush head gets stuck on my Professional model, so this is a big advantage of the Pulsonic.  The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there\'s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  When it\'s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional\'s circular head.  The Pulsonic assists in cleaning by sending out sonic pulses, similar to a jewelry sonication cleaner.  This is used to blast off debris and break up bacteria biofilms that are populating your teeth and gums.  The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  Here\'s where I feel is the key difference that should determine which type of toothbrush you should get.  I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  The Pulsonic requires you to make tiny circular motions over your teeth and assists your cleaning with the sonic vibrations.  The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don\'t get me wrong, it\'s much better than a manual toothbrush.  But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  I\'ve never had a cavity, but the dentist always complains that my gums are a little too puffy or too red.  After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  I don\'t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.The other thing I\'ll mention about the Pulsonic is the base.  The base has a small footprint size and the Pulsonic simply rests in a small hole in the base.  It\'s a bit wobbly, but it works alright.  The problem I have, however, is that there are only two spots for brush heads.  The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have their own brush head(s) it\'s an annoying inconvenience.So I think the choice is up to your specific needs.  If you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush and commonly have cavity problems, then maybe you want to go with one of the high-end Oral-B models that have a circular head.  If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I\'d recommend the Pulsonic.  I\'m not a dentist, so that\'s just my opinion.  For my needs, though, I\'ll be sticking with the Pulsonic.UPDATE:I went to the dentist recently for my standard 6-month check-up.  I\'ve never had cavity problems before, but the dentist had always warned me that my gums and gum pockets were borderline beginning to show problems.  Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  While the hygienist was cleaning my teeth she asked, \'do you use an electric toothbrush?\'  When I replied yes, she said, \'yeah, I can tell.\'  So, there ya go.  I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they\'ve been in in years.  With that, I\'ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush."

I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head). Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me."

Then again, other dentists have said they\'re nothing special, and careful brushing using a regular toothbrush is just fine. Anyway, I certainly can\'t seen any harm in trying one and after just a few days of use so far, I\'m already beginning to think it was a worthwhile decision.The Oral-B 3000 is easy to use, feels reasonably solid in hand, and is simple to keep clean (it\'s nice that the brush can be removed quickly to rinse out). I was a little nervous the first time I tried it, expecting bleeding gums or soreness, but in fact the opposite has been true. Because there\'s no need to scrub hard, it\'s actually quite gentle, though the sensation is a little strange at first and it took me a few tries to get used to it. I felt it was really getting my gum-line clean, and because they recommend just two minutes (30 seconds per \'quadrant\') I was actually more aware than I usually am with a regular toothbrush about reaching every corner of my mouth and teeth... I guess with no \'instructions\' and years of just using a normal toothbrush, it\'s sometimes easy to forget what we learned as children when it comes to brushing our teeth!So, I\'m happy so far. My mouth and teeth have never felt so clean immediately after brushing (note, that \'clean\' feeling of course quickly disappears once you eat again), though the way the device vibrates against my jaw is a little perturbing, but I\'ll just have to get used to that. I\'d have liked to have seen a few more brush heads supplied with the product as I feel those will get expensive. I noticed the Oral-B site mentions this product coming with four different brushes, but the package states that we only get the one. There appear to be a variety of different brushes available, but I\'m not sure how useful they all are... I\'ll probably stick to just the original one as it already does a better job than a regular brush at polishing my teeth, and I\'m not sure how well the other ones would work. There is one brush with two heads though, that could be interesting to try and might clean even better. Fortunately, these replacement heads are not horribly expensive online, despite being considerably more than a normal toothbrush and lasting about as long. Still, it\'s a small price to pay for that \'clean teeth\' feel, I think."

It\'s an electric toothbrush that\'s about the same size a conventional toothbrush!And it does a good job of cleaning my teeth. I\'ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I\'m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance. It\'s a mighty little toothbrush.The one and only drawback I\'ve found -- and it\'s a small one --  is that unlike the Sonicare the Pulsonic doesn\'t have a 2 minute timer. Instead it has a 30 second timer.  You have to count to four without electronic assistance (Four 30-sec treatments equal 2 minutes which is my Dentist\'s recommended brushing time.)Also as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars. Most toothbrushes -- both electric and non-electric -- fail this test. So that\'s another big plus.So in a nutshell, if you\'re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel), small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all."

This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.The one positive thing is the toothbrush\'s compactness.

Our only complaint is that if you like REALLY strong coffee AND want a lot of it (i.e., more than 8 cups...according to the water gauge), you are out-of-luck  because  the coffee grounds flow over the top of filter. Grounds in coffee - not so good.Finally, the Brita water filter that is a part of this coffee-maker (sold separately of course) works well too."

I mean, it\'s a toothbrush after all. WRONG. Once you\'ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you\'ll never go back.Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  Always have.  Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  However, I went ahead and gave it a try.In less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  I put on the toothpaste and away I went.  The best thing is the size of the rotating head: it\'s about the size of a tooth.  Gee: what a novel idea! As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  This allowed me to work on my teeth while moving towards my gums.  In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.One of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth. This was something I could NEVER do with a regular toothbrush.  I also have some very deep pockets in my gums that have a tendency to hurt and bleed. However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  Oral-b is a reliable brand and this is in keeping with the brand recognition.  I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  It\'s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera! ;)"

We\'d sing the Tigger song while brushing, which helped make things fun. But I have a couple complaints:1. The whole thing is a little large and cumbersome for a 3-year-old. Getting the back teeth is tricky for him, and when we take over to \'do finishing touches,\' we\'d always end up bonking him on the teeth/ gums/ lips with part of this toothbrush. This made him mad, and when you are trying to convince a toddler that toothbrushing is fun, you do not want to make him mad.2. The brush head is not replaceable. So once the bristles are worn, you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one. Sure, the purchase price is cheap, but like so many things, that is not the \'real cost,\' once you factor in how many you\'ll have to buy and how many you put in the landfill. (Batteries are replaceable but the toothbrush is not rechargeable.) I recommend getting one that allows you to replace the head and keep the Tigger.We are now looking at the Sonicare kids toothbrush, which is much more expensive but which includes two different-size brushheads for growing with-- and bonus, it\'s rechargeable."

As a dentaphobe, I will always be grateful to Sonicare for keeping my mouth cavity free for my 7 year hiatus from the dentist- though to be fair, I also drank mostly water (vs. sugared drinks) and made sure to brush and floss twice daily, chewing sugarless gum throughout the day. Still, I found the Oral B a very nice upgrade for several reasons:1. NO ICKYNESS IN THE BRUSH HEAD!!! Sonicare brushes are notorious for getting all this disgusting gunk stuck up inside the brush head, leaving me with a sense of wonder about what exactly I was putting in my mouth, even after rinsing the head thoroughly in alcohol.2. Smaller brush heads. I finally feel like I am cleaning my wisdom teeth, which stick back almost to the uvula.3. Circular brush heads. Dentists always say to brush in circular motions, yet typical Sonicare brushes only go side to side.4. Using the floss-action head truly leaves less behind when I floss right after brushing.5. Another reviewer mentioned the fact Sonicare does not offer either soft bristled brushes or a sensitive mode.There were a couple downsides:1. Noise. The Oral B seems much louder, likely because the brush is moving in a circle vs. just side to side.2. Vibration Speed. One of Sonicare\'s main tenants for their brushes is that the sonic action itself gets rid of plaque/germs. The Oral B does not seem to vibrate quite as much- though flossing seems to yield fewer hangers-on, and does not just compact any recently-eaten food- such as cracker mush.There are other benefits, which Sonicare has also added to its latest greatest brushes, such as timers and better chargers. Still, I am happy with the switch- I\'ll just see if my dentist notices =)UPDATE; 2011- Going back to Sonicare.I had the brush about a year when the battery started dying ALL the time- would go from 3 of 4 bars to 0 bars in the middle of brushing. If you prefer leaving your brush plugged in all the time, this may not be a problem- but I like my batteries to hold some charge.Also, in the end, I do not feel like the brush is cleaning between the teeth as much as a Sonicare. Likely thanks to all the complainers like myself, I\'ve been exploring Amazon and noticing Sonicare has now created smaller brush heads with only the prong attachment/gotten rid of the ick factor of their bigger brush heads, and made the brushes overall less expensive (under $80).In the midst of the year\'s use, I sucked it up and returned to the dentist... to find I had 7 cavities =( While I obviously can\'t entirely blame the Oral B for this result, I again cite that the brush did not seem to clean as well between teeth/I miss the sonic action of the Sonicare- and did leave any late night cracker/chip remnants pushed down on my back teeth. So look for a new review of the latest Sonicare brush soon!"

The floss-action brush is really good at cleaning between the teeth, too, as I found out when I manually flossed afterward.

Check the Oral-B website for a $[...] rebate through June 2010!Included in the box is a pro-white brush (in addition to the floss-action), a charger and covered compartment for the brush heads, a nice travel case for the base, and extra batteries for the smartguide. There is adhesive tape for mounting the smartguide on a wall or mirror, but the smartguide sits nicely on the bathroom counter as well. I like the smartguide and its dual function as a bathroom clock. Very cool. It also keeps me on track as I brush.As other reviewers have noted, the battery cover on the smartguide is somewhat difficult to remove, and you have to take it off to access the buttons to set the clock. The plug on the charger is also rather large and takes up a chunk of space on the bathroom counter.  These are small annoyances, though.

My dentist has told me that I need to floss regularly since my gums are receding.  This toothbrush a little louder than I expected, but remember this is my first power toothbrush.  I really like the two minute timer feature becuase my dentist always told me that I was always \'over\' brushing.  Since brushing with an up and down movement can wear off the enamel (as told by my dentist), the Oral-B toothbrush uses oscillating and rotating movement which dentists prefer.  The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited warranty.Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.

The problem with Sonicare was durability (that was less than 2 years on average) and high cost. But I should say that when (once) it died during first year, it took one phone call to get replacement.Oral-B looked better per reviews and also it had cheaper replacement heads. So, we decided to give a try.As a toothbrush, it works differently from Sonicare and at the beginning we liked it quite more. But after a while, I\'m not sure which one I like more. In either case, it does job done. I would not suggest buying the fancy timer though.However, this one died in a half a year. By itself, one sample is not a statistic. But customer support was quite less friendly and we had to ship the toothbrush with papers for \'repair\'. At the end, we\'ve got a new one - but is was much more painful.Bottom line: I would rate the toothbrush about the same as Sonicare, quite worth customer support and (so far) same poor reliability.

I would recommend it as an entry-level electric toothbrush to those who are too unsure about the technology to pay for one of the more higher priced models.Full disclosure: I received this toothbrush free as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, at the low cost of $29.99 I probably would\'ve bought it anyway. I think it is definitely worth that price for a first-time electric toothbrush.PROSCLEANING: My teeth get much cleaner when I use this toothbrush versus my traditional one. They feel smooth, just like I came from the dentist. Flossing also seems easier while using this toothbrush because, with the right tilt on the brush, it is better able to clean between my teeth and at the gum line, so there seems to be less tartar buildup when I floss.WHITENING: The stain removal is EXCELLENT. My teeth are not that stained, but during the 2 weeks I\'ve been using this brush, I\'ve noticed a *significant* decrease in the yellow stains near my gum line.BATTERY: This may sound odd, but I liked the way the battery ran out. I was a bit concerned about what would happen and how I would handle it (the instructions give no clue). It pretty much just stops working, no wind-down at all. I liked that because it left no mystery as to \'will it or won\'t it\' finish and I just finished brushing my teeth with it manually. I\'ve used this toothbrush 1-2 times per day for over 2 weeks now, and I\'ve only had to charge it once.REPLACEMENTS: The brush indicates when it needs to be replaced via color loss on the bristles (just like some traditional toothbrushes do). It does come with an extra head, as well as a $3 coupon for another one.CONSDROPLETS: The only negative on this toothbrush is probably just due to my inexperience with electric toothbrushes: it sprays toothpaste droplets onto my clothing. Now I try to brush my teeth before I dress, or else I drape a hand towel over my blouse while brushing.VIBRATIONS: As others have mentioned, the vibrations are INCREDIBLY strong on this toothbrush. You should NOT press it hard against your teeth; just lay it gently onto them and let the brush do the work for you. My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive (I have several cracked ones) and once I stopped pressing with the brush, I had no problems with pain due to the vibrations. However, the vibrations DO make my nose ticklish.Unlike other reviewers, I have NOT experienced any \'gunk\' buildup in the toothbrush stand because I always rinse off my toothbrush the way the instructions say to. (If you put ANY toothbrush back in its holder without rinsing it well enough, you\'re going to get \'gunk.\')Overall, I would recommend this as a fine first electric toothbrush, especially at this price point."

I couldn\'t believe the deal I got on here!  I saved about half compared to other stores in my area.  If you have sensitive teeth I would highly recommend this model.  Oral-B also makes the 1000 series model.  There\'s nothing wrong with this I am sure, however I believe it doesn\'t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  The only downfall is that about once a week you do have to charge the battery (which does take about 17 hours).  Honestly, that\'s not a big deal.  The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  It has room for additional brush heads.  It\'s a nice feature, but something I really don\'t find the need for.  Overall, those are minor things.  I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains."

My teeth feel cleaner than ever before (sounds cheesy, but its true!). Here\'s what I think after having used this product for just about 2 weeks:1. The design is very simple. The battery enclosure is rubberized, stays water proof and the whole toothbrush feels sound and well made. It came with Duracell batteries which was a pleasant surprise.2. The cleaning action is fantastic. My gums are quite sensitive but this toothbrush has really gentle bristles that don\'t hurt my gums at all.3. I love the awesome 2-minute timer that lets you know that you\'ve been brushing for 2 minutes with a slightly different \'vibration\' pattern.4. Strangely, I\'ve been brushing my teeth 3 times a day since I got this brush!Overall, I have absolutely no complaints. I love this toothbrush and its a phenomenal buy for the price. Amazon rocks as usual. I noticed that replacement heads are a little expensive but really worth it (make sure they\'re from a reputable seller due to fakes on the market). I\'ll be sticking with the Oral-B Precision Clean line for life.UPDATE 8/18/11: After almost 6 months of use, this little guy is still going strong! I\'ve had to replace both the batteries and head only once the whole time. Very happy with this toothbrush!"

While I have been blessed with a cavity free mouth, I still hate enduring the scrape of the dentist\'s tools against my teeth. And I know it\'s just a matter of time until the dentist breaks out his drill...It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  You can probably chalk it up to \'user error\'....  I wasn\'t brushing properly, nor long enough to really keep a clean mouth.I did a bunch of research on electric toothbrushes to see what the fuss was about. Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  hmmm...  more research led me to this model - the motorized head rotates in the recommended pattern and the handle buzzes/vibrates in 30 or 45 second intervals to help you judge the brushing time of each section of your mouth.  Recommended time is 30 seconds per quadrant.  But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn\'t enough for me.  What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up) the amount of time you have been brushing.  If you look at the picture of the box, you can see the digital display, it\'s a little bit bigger than a business card, and about an inch thick.  As you are brushing, the display will track the quadrant you are brushing, and when your brush handle buzzes, the digital display will move to the next quadrant - giving you a visual que to move on to the next section of your mouth. It will even tell you if you\'re brushing too hard! When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds... the smiley face will wink at you!  :  It\'s a flirty toothbrush!My husband and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  We absolutely love them.  We recieved them two days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.  I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn\'t a big deal. I never have to wonder if I\'m brushing properly or if I\'m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \'fresh from the dentist\' clean mouth.  The handle holds its\' charge for a long time, I can brush for 2 1/2 minutes twice a day, for 9 days before having to recharge - however, I usually keep the brush handle in the charger when it\'s not in use.I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  The travel case is a hard, sturdy plastic to protect the brush handle, and the detachable brush.  It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly. My toothbrush will never again travel in a ziploc baggie.  :) Yay!I did have a little bit of sticker shock when I purchased two of these at the same time, and then again when I saw the cost of replacement brush heads.  But I feel like I am taking good care of my teeth, and I know my next dentist appointment will be less stressful.  Also - I know P&G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time. This makes me feel like I\'ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  Plus P&G offers coupons on their website all the time, so I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.This model isn\'t just an electric toothbrush - It\'s quality control for your mouth!  I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  Happy Brushing."

3056,3142,20111217,B0043VYSI2,5,"December 17, 2011",A2H2HDAZCKDSSO,Good Toothbrush,I\'ve been using an Oral B for many years now.  I\'m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  When you have teeth that are not straight like I do the back sides of your teeth are very hard to reach and the smaller round head on the brush I find reaches the hard to get areas better than the longer rectangular brushes.  Doesn\'t straighten your teeth though.  Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I\'m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  I tend to think that is glamor over substance.  After all the brush is just rotating in an oscillating motion purre and simple.  It works and works well.  My model hesistates at the end of two minutes and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  You still need to floss and thats expected.  I have been very pleased with my last unit.  I didn\'t save the box and the model number isn\'t on it so I cant say which one it is.  I\'ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  Good product and will continue to use till new technology comes up with something better.

Fortunately, this model has a built-in timer, which notifies you that it\'s time to stop or you\'ll overdo it. That is a very nice feature. The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth. After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning. The brush is also smaller and requires you to use less toothpaste, which will result in savings over time. The only downside is that the brushes are a little on the pricey side, but I\'m hoping they last longer than my regular brush.If you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush. Not only does it do a great job at cleaning teeth, I\'m sure this will result in less cavities when I get my dental check-ups."

Uses standard AA batteries so that I can use cheap ones or rechargeables. Has a 2 minutes timer that buzzes the toothbrushing to let you know when you\'ve been brushing for 2 mins so you force yourself to try and brush longer. Can use pretty standard Oral-B type larger brush-heads that you can buy at Costco or Amazon in family size 6-packs.Can\'t think of any cons to having this toothbrush as its much better than buying some expensive toothbrush rechargeable kit that doesn\'t use standard AA batteries or comes with a watering system that I wouldn\'t use.

Any retail store you go to this is going to be around $140-$160.I will start with the pros. The first time I started using the Oral B 5000 toothbrush I noticed how clean my teeth felt after brushing. I have been using this product for over a month now and love the pressure sensor. That is the main reason why I bought this product is because I have a habit of brushing hard. It has 4 dedicated modes which are great and one mode with extended time. I switch modes pretty much every time I use it. My teeth are getting slightly whiter after a month. The wireless brushing guide/clock is really handy so you can see what mode you are on and how much time you have been brushing. The charging base is great and very portable compared to other models.Now the cons. There are only a few things that I can think of that aren\'t that great with this toothbrush. The display mode on the handle really bugs me. It just displays the battery and nothing else. This is pretty pointless especially when you travel. Because it doesn\'t tell you which mode you are in so you have to go by feel to figure which mode you want. The display of the battery is so large it makes me wonder how much battery it drains to display that thing because its always on. That brings me to my next point is the life of the battery. It says in the manual that the life is 10 days. But seems to be less than that. My girlfriend has the 4000 and hers lasts longer than mine. Her display is for the battery is smaller and in the corner of the display instead of enourmous and in the middle.

What I found is that the Vitality has a lot more power -- judged by the vibrations in my head -- plus it\'s even lighter weight, has replaceable heads, and a timer.Lighter weight is good, as are the replaceable heads because that means the whole family can use one base, and you can replace the toothbrush-head after flu or colds.More power should mean that it cleans better.  What I found is that my mouth felt \'cleaner\'... BUT, after I let my teeth \'go\' and get rather \'grotty\' for test reasons, the Vitality didn\'t seem to clean any better in those hard to reach between teeth spots, than it\'s cheaper cousin.  To be honest, I\'m not sure what to make of this observation.  I tried the cheaper cousin after that, plus a standard toothbrush, and nothing worked except floss -- thank heaven -- so perhaps my expectations are too high and no brush would accomplish this task.THE SKINNY:::We will be switching to this Oral B toothbrush and the reason is that I think it\'s more cost effective for us than cheaper Oral B battery operated models that we are currently using.  Though more expensive initially, you can purchase replacement heads so the whole family can use one base.I like the timer.  I thought only the kids would benefit, but to my surprise I wasn\'t brushing long enough either.It doesn\'t remove plague like claimed, but it definitely has more power than our comparison Oral B\'s, and made my mouth feel cleaner.I liked that the brushes were NOT rock hard.

But few complains about this specific model 5000.1) The handle on 5000 is much bigger than on other similar toothbrushes. It is less comfortable to hold in hand.2) The extra device coming with model 5000 is useless. It is supposedly an \'advanced\' timer which makes beeping noise when you need to switch sides of teeth to brush and when to stop brusing. I think, timers embedded in the toothbrush handle itself (what they do for less expensive models) do better job - there is absolutely no benefits to have timer separately (in addition it\'s screen is hard to see).3)The electric plug on this toothbrush is much longer than on other models. The base, though, is much smaller. Apparently they moved electronics from the base (where toothbrush stands) to the plug. It does not look good when plug is plugged in recepticle and it makes dificulties always to avoid pushing the plug.4) Another big complain - never received rebate. it was $50 rebate for this toothbrush when I bought it in August. I filled all forms and send them in. But, until today I do not have rebate. I opened case with amazon and will give you update if I get rebate eventually.

It\'s got a very rough-and-tumble feel to it, but it feels so good, almost like a rough massage to my teeth and gums.I thought the brush head would be too small (I have big teeth - I\'m a big dude), but I liked the idea of the circular action, and I wanted to spend less than 50 bucks on an upgrade, so I gave it a shot.  It doesn\'t feel small, though, when it\'s running.  My teeth are sensitive and it\'s not an exaggeration to say that every teeth-brushing experience in my life has been tinged with a discomfort that is totally absent with this toothbrush, even though it has such an aggressive feel.

I used to use the Sonicare Elite 9500.3. I just opened the package yesterday evening and have used it twice so far.4. I needed a new brush because my old brush\'s battery died.*Brushing*Pros1. I am happy with the cleaning that I am getting.2. The brush feels like it is massaging my gums.*Charging*Pros1. This brush is dual voltage and will work both in 110v and 220v areas.2. This base of the brush seems much more stable than my  Sonicare since it is a little wider.*Traveling*Pros1. The brush does include a travel case.2. Since the travel case is plastic, it will be much easier to clean though compared to the cloth Sonicare case I had.Cons1. The travel case is MUCH larger than my old Sonicare.2. The travel case appears that it is more likely to break since the plastic hinge area seems like it can wear down.3. The brush heads do not have a plastic cap to help protect the bristles.  I liked that the Sonicare had this option since I was reassured that nothing dirty was touching the bristles while transporting it.*Operation*Cons1. I could not figure out how to get the brush to offer an audible cue when switching quadrants while connected to the SmartGuide.  It only offers an audible cue when the radio is turned off.*Cost*Pros1. This brush is much cheaper than the latest Sonicare.2. Replacement brush heads are much cheaper than the Sonicare (by about half the price).*Maintenance*Pros1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush heads appears that it will be much easier to clean unlike my Sonicare which always had a lot of buildup that was difficult to clean.Cons1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush head is a relatively small metal rod.  I am concerned that if I drop the toothbrush, this may bend and I would be unable to load any brush heads.2. On either side of the brush, there is a section with a silver coating.  Unfortunately, this stains easily with water stains.  I wish that Oral-B had used something that would help avoid the water stains.Overall, I am content with the brush. I wouldn\'t consider myself a Sonicare convert since this isn\'t perfect either, but I plan on keeping this brush."

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it\'s kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

When there are brushes out there on the market from $50-$180, this is bang for the buck.  It\'s lightweight, can be stored on the charger (the brush can\'t be overcharged), the charge lasts for awhile (I\'d say about a week) and there is a timer on it too.  That feature is really important since I def. don\'t brush the full couple of minutes without it.  It came with an extra brush head too, a nice bonus.  I have a Sonicare, which I like a lot and think is a more powerful cleaner but it\'s more expensive. I think this brush is great for everyday use, but I will esp. be using it for travel since it\'s lightweight and smaller than my bulky Sonicare."

The bristles initially felt too hard, but it\'s just a matter of getting accustomed to the toothbrush.Although this toothbrush cleans the teeth well I cannot emphasize enough the importance of continuing to floss between the teeth.  The timer that comes with the device is not necesssary as there is a slight change in speed after each 30 seconds of brushing, but I do find it helpful for me.I keep my brush on the charger, but find it works fine without the charger when I\'m out of town over a week. If you keep it plugged in make sure the brush is seated properly or it will overheat. When used in conjunction with the Oral Breeze Quick Breeze (faucet attachment) it makes for a really clean-feeling mouth.

I am able to eat with relative abandon again (after getting braces) once I learned how to use the SmartSeries 5000 properly and in a systematic way.The SmartSeries 5000 (with an ortho brush head and power tip attachment) has made brushing and cleaning with braces on extremely easy and a no-brainer.The kit includes a handy travel case (with holders for two attachments), lightweight charger, and timer which links wirelessly to the toothbrush.I usually start with the power tip which is very effective in cleaning debris around brackets and between the wires.  To clean with the ortho brush head, simply press it in front of each tooth and count slowly to twelve -- going from the rear molars to the front teeth on each side on both top and bottom rows of teeth. After that, just brush the biting surfaces and rear of the teeth.Overall, the kit components were very useful to me except for the timer.The timer would display a ring which represented the top and bottom rows of teeth.  The ring was split into four sections and the timer would indicate the amount of time needed for each quadrant of teeth.  It was somewhat tricky to clean by the quadrant and just easier for me to use a fixed count for each tooth."

The fakes are also getting very hard to spot apparently, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct.

When I brush with an electric toothbrush, I want to be able to slowly move my toothbrush around while the cleaning power of the toothbrush head does all the work and leaves my mouth feeling dentist clean.  That is not the experience I have had with the pulsonic.  Although the brush head vibrates significantly and loosens plaque, I find I\'m having to perform the laborious back-and-forth to the extent that I do with a manual brush.  Electric brushing is supposed to be fun and easy!  Oscillation is key, and this brush doesn\'t have it."

I was skeptical because I have been using its direct competitor for about a year, the top-of-the-line Sonicare Flexcare HX6950 with UV Sanitizer, and was very happy with that brush.  A friend of mine has the Oral-B smart series, and when I saw it, I knew I had to give it a try to see what all the hype was about.  I found the opportunity when my father asked me to order him one, so I threw in an extra one for myself.  It arrived in two days from Amazon, brand spanking new.I\'ve used the Orab-B for about a week, 14 times, and I have to say its different than the Sonicare, not necessarily better, but just different, and just as good.  The Oral-B gives you a different kind of clean, and I definitely feel my teeth and gums get a really, really good cleaning after brushing.  My teeth also seem whiter now.  I think the Oral-B removes more plaque off my teeth, and more food from between my teeth due to the optional Floss Action brush head I\'ve been using.  Don\'t be fooled, there is no substitution for flossing, but this brush head does a little for you, especially if you have bigger natural gaps between your teeth, of which I don\'t, so I have to floss.  The Floss Action brush head is really amazing, quite an innovation, and I love it.The wireless SmartGuide is pretty clever too.  It automatically goes on when you turn your toothbrush on.  I can definitely say, that the SmartGuide helps you to brush longer and more thoroughly.  Its almost like a trainer when your brushing, rooting for you to finish 30 seconds on each setting.  I do one cycle for the top teeth, and one cycle for the bottom teeth.  The SmartGuide is very helpful to anyone, no matter your age.  The four different stages of this electric toothbrush are also very helpful, I use them all, and always will.The Oral-B Smart Series 5000 comes with one Floss Action brush head, and one Pro White brush head.  I also ordered a 4 pack of sensitive brush heads, but haven\'t used them yet.  In addition, after seeing how much I like the Floss Action brush head, I ordered more of those, a 3 pack actually.  If your wondering about the price, forget about it, its totally worth it, and will probably save you thousands of dollars worth of needless dental work due to cavities.  I can\'t recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush enough.  In fact, if you have the money, be generous and buy them for other people that can\'t afford one.  Everyone should be able to use one of these, they are that beneficial to oral hygiene.  I can\'t imagine using a regular toothbrush after using an electric one, especially an electric on of this quality.As usual, Amazon is amazing for price, shipping, product quality, and customer service, literally the best store on the planet.  I don\'t even understand how other stores can stay in business with Amazon in existence.  I stopped keeping track of how much money I\'ve spent here in the past 10 years..lol."

The difference was immediate. My first visit to the hygienist after two months use astounded her. She told me she had allowed an hour for my cleaning as the calculus buildup on my teeth had been graded C on my visit 6 months previously. She said it was now an A, and was finished in 20 minutes(No discount). She was impressed that the only difference was an Oral B electric with the floss brush-head. As for the 5000 the difference is noticeable. Much longer battery life. Where the 3D was good for 3 minutes and then needed an hour charge. The 5000 will go at least 5 minutes with full power. Probably more. I got bored and ended my experiment after 5 minutes. I also like the fact it is only high speed with a 30 second pulse. I never saw the need for a slower speed option. The 5000 also has an open charging stand, eliminating the gunk buildup the 3D was prone to, and taking less counter space. As for the clock, I have no idea what it\'s for. Set up is simple. Just plug in the charger and set the brush on. The display will let you know when you\'re ready to go. And best of all you can\'t screw it up. The battery will hold a full charge whether you brush 1 minute or 5. No worries about running it down to achieve full charge like many cell phones.

Alkaline batteries last a month. So it is very useful for traveling.- Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken. Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.- If you want to save the environment and you don\'t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans then you don\'t like toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries.

I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  I floss daily and have used a Sonicare electric brush for close to 15 years.  It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  That was a bit much for me.  And my teeth weren\'t that bad, it\'s just that he was very fastidious.  I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  And I ALWAYS swish my mouth out with water after eating or drinking anything.Anyway, when I got the chance to try this Oral-b, of course I was up for the challenge.  When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the other.After trying the Oral-b for a week, I can tell you that I am definitely a Sonicare person.  Here is the breakdown of my experience:Oral-b pros:*Handle feels nice in hand.  It has a silicone/rubbery grip that is ergononimic*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.Oral-b cons:*Way too noisy.  I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  Not a relaxing experience, I felt too stressed with all of the noise, lights, and buzzing.*The depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush head.*It does not stop after 2 minutes of brushing.  I am used to the way the Sonicare handle stops working after you\'ve hit the 2 minute mark.  With the Sonicare if I want to keep brushing after the 2 minutes, I just press the button again.  With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn\'t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  Next bullet point.*Loud humming with surge pulse.  This is Oral-b\'s answer to Sonicare\'s quadrant pacer, where it nudges you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn\'t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!*Single button control. It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.*Cleanliness?  I didn\'t feel like my teeth were any cleaner than they already were when I used my Sonicare.I still believe that liking the Oral-b or Sonicare is a matter of personal preference.  Cost analysis-wise, the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  But I prefer the Sonicare."

If you don\'t want to read it all, I give you this quick summary. Great product, well worth the price at amazon. Best clean you can get and has many useful features. I have never had healthier teeth and gums. Read further for more details.This product is simply outstanding and in a class of it\'s own.I had a situation in which my gums are not in their peak condition, and that is putting it lightly. I have had this toothbrush for just a touch over two weeks. I also drink coffee every day, only 1 cup though. Since I have been using this, my gums are already noticeably healthier, my teeth are whiter, and I find it easier to make sure I brush at least twice a day. I think this is mostly because of how much I invested into this product. At this point I have nothing but good things to say about this toothbrush.I also have my wisdom teeth fully grown in and this toothbrush is small enough where I am able to reach them and give them a proper cleaning. My wife is also using it with a separate brush head.The device takes a full 10 hours on initial charge before use, as seems to be normal for most NiMh batteries. At first the backing on the timer is a bit confusing and difficult to get off as the instructions do not help. Once you figure it out though, It is quite easy to master.Positive feedback:Now onto a more descriptive part about the features this offers. Since my gums are sensitive to begin with I can only use the normal clean and sensitive options until my gums are healthier. The other modes are a really nice feature that I plan to use when I can.The included 2 sided tape is nice for when you want to mount it to the wall.I really like how both the toothbrush and the timer give you an indication of when to switch quadrants in your mouth every thirty seconds. The timer will blink and display that you should be working on the next quadrant. The toothbrush pulses every 30 seconds and pulses 3 times every 2 minutes. (I personally don\'t think 30seconds is enough for each quadrant so I often spend more time after brushing to give my whole mouth a quick once over.)Once you get the timer set and mounted it does make a nice restroom clock as other have said. After charging and setting the timer, the toothbrush is easy effective and gives the best clean I have experienced sans a dental visit.Also a side note, I asked my dental hygienist which toothbrush they recommend for electrical as they said I should get one. This one came at the very top of their recommendations. Before this I was using Oral-B\'s cheap $20 electrical toothbrush. The difference is astounding.The container for the extra toothbrush heads is very nice allows you to let the head dry out while not connected to the handle. They brush heads are very easy to remove and clean. The different color rings are very helpful if you have more then 1 person using the same style brush head.The travel pack is a really nice and touch and is compact too.Best clean you can get without visiting a dental hygienist.Negative Feedback:The back plate on the timer is a bit unwieldy at first.The toothbrush is a bit loud but not as loud as the $20 dollar variants.IT would have been nice if the battery came pre-charged. It would also have been nice if the timer also came with a rechargeable battery solution.It is expensive and costs way too much at a standard retail store($150).It only comes with 2 brush heads."

I like the improvements they have made over the other oral B I had.  It has three brushing functions all on one button. I prefer the sensitive mode, and occasionally use the whiting mode.  My teeth feel really clean after brushing.  I like the light that comes on if you are brushing too hard. It also buzzes after each 30 seconds to change quantrants you are brushing and buzzes 3 times at the end of 2 minutes. The charging unit is a lot smaller than the previous one, which is nice if you have limited counter space in your bathroom.  The charge last about one week, and it takes at least 12 hours to charge the brush. Overall I am very satisfied with this brushing unit.  Ii would highly recommend it."

Recommended by my oral hygenist, it really cleans my teeth - makes them feel velvety smooth... just like when my hygenist finishes cleaning my teeth. I can\'t get that with any other electric or non-electric toothbrush. The better a product is, the harder I evaluate it and the more nit-picky I become, so here go the suggested improvements: First, the recommended cleaning time is 2 minutes which I believe is way too short. I double that by brushing the lower and upper jaw, each using the times for my entire mouth. Last, the controls are too easy to accidentally hit. This causes the toothbrush to go into another cleaning mode when you didn\'t want it to. I don\'t know how you can fix this except to be careful when holding the toothbrush and not accidentally hit one of the two buttons on the handle. I imagine if they located the controls elsewhere, or made them more difficult to press, I would be complaining about the ergonomics! Maybe a lockout on the end of the brush would help? Excellent toothbrush, charge lasts a long time, slim, light, fairly quiet, brush heads (choice of 4 different heads; comes with two: deep clean and polish) designed to clean deep and in between the teeth.

2133,2183,20110318,B002HWS9GG,5,"March 18, 2011",AW7BGAR3VSIY5,Great Toothbrush,"I bought the Oral-B 5000 brush after doing extensive research. This was my first electric or powered toothbrush. I will not compare it with Philips Sonicare as both are excellent brushes. I went with oral-b as I prefer a rotatory brush over a one that just moves up and down. If like me you are new to electric toothbrush and are wondering if it will be too harsh on your teeth and gums, then I can assure you that I found this oral-b 5000 very gentle. If fact, I would have preferred if it had a little bit more power. I have healthy teeth and gums so for someone who has very sensitive teeth this might be an issue. This brush however has a sensitive mode which reduces the power considerably so you can still go with it.The oral-b 5000 box came with a brush handle (oral-b trimph), 2 brush heads (1 flossaction. 1 prowhite), a smart guide, traveling case, a charging station (charging ring + brushhead storage stand) and a smart plug. An important note: only the oral-b 5000 and 4000 series come with a smart plug (100-240 V) adapter. Others 3000 and lower versions just work for US voltage only and you will need to buy a voltage converter if you want to travel with it. You can tell by looking at the pictures on the outside of the box. Smart plug is bigger as it has voltage conversion circuitry inside it, the other one is just an electric plug. Since I travel frequently, so this was very important to me and thus my choice was limited to 4000 or 5000 series only.Difference between the 4000 and 5000 is that 5000 has a smart guide and the charging station that has a place to store 4 extra brush heads, plus 5000 has one extra mode of operation. Other than that both are identical. The smart guide is not essential for brushing. It just shows you various information like the brushing mode you are using, total brush time, low battery indicator, over pressure warning. It also similes and winks at you! I find it convenient as all the information is in front of me, and if I wanted to change my brushing mode, I do not need to take the toothbrush out of my mouth. The toothbrush always starts in the daily clean mode and you cannot turn it on outside your mouth, as it then sprays toothpaste all over the counter and sink, so if it was not for the smart guide, you will find it very difficult to select the desired brushing mode on the toothbrush.The brush handle and brush heads are made in Germany. They appear well-constructed. The brush handle is water proof and factory sealed against moisture. This is very important as otherwise the moisture will ruin the battery and the circuitry inside, a common problem with electric brushes powered with replaceable AA batteries. The toothbrush is charged through magnetic induction, so it is safe to put the charging station on the bathroom counter, near water. Brush heads are easy to clean and replace. In fact, more than 1 person can use the brush handle, as the only thing that goes into the mouth is the brush head and each person can use their own brush head. The brush heads come with their own colored rings, so you cannot mix your brush head with someone else. The battery life is good and with my typical brushing time of 4-5 minutes twice a day, it lasts for 4-5 days.Finally, about the price. I got the 50% off offer, so the 5000 ended up costing me about $65. It was an excellent deal for me. Is this brush worth $159? Well, I would have to say no. If you can get it for below $100 then it is an excellent deal. Is it better than a manual toothbrush? I would have to say yes! It is 200% better than a manual toothbrush. In fact, after using this you will wonder why you did not switch before.Now, if the brush handle lasts for 3 years and each brush head lasts for at least 5 months, then I will be satisfied with my $65 down payment on this toothbrush.I hope my review was useful. I have tried to concentrate on information I did not find in other reviews. If anyone needs additional information just write a comment on this review and I will respond."

I also love the display that shows how much time is left and whether you are brushing too hard.  My only complaint is that the battery has deteriorated greatly after only a year.  I conditioned the battery properly, so this really shouldn\'t have happened.  The battery cannot be easily replaced, hence the full brush disposal instructions they give you.

We own two, rechargeable, Oral B toothbrush bases and each child and I has our own brushhead that simply snaps on and off.In comparison to brushing with a manual toothbrush, the Oral B electric toothbrush is a far superior brushing solution. You can\'t really compare manual brushing to an Oral B anymore than you can compare a bike to a car.  A bike will get you there, but not as quickly or comfortably as a car. The oral B accesses harder to reach areas of your mouth easier than a manual toothbrush, and the brush spins much faster than you could ever hope to brush on your own.In comparison to other electric toothbrushes, I chose the Oral B because it was far more economical than other brands. It is affordable, and the brush replacement costs are very reasonable, especially when you buy bulk packages here or at a warehouse store.Now, on to this specific Oral B brushhead.  The base unit also works with the standard Oral B brushheads that I already use.  This brush head is slightly more oval shaped to mimic a tooth\'s surface and shape, versus the circular standard brushhead.  It also has a polishing cup in the center of the brush head where brush bristles would normally be present on the standard, circular brush head. So, picture the standard brush head with a polishing cup in the dead center of the brush head and you can get a mental picture of this new brush head\'s design.With the more powerful motor and new brush head, I like this Oral B better than the standard Oral B that I have been using.  It cleans even better and I really like the polishing cup since I am a heavy coffee drinker and try to minimize teeth staining.  While you can\'t go wrong with any of the Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes, I would recommend this one.  If you are still using a manual toothbrush, I would strongly suggest at least trying out an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  If you do, you will never go back to manual brushing again.UPDATE.......After using this brush head for several months now, I am convinced that it has made my teeth more white. I had worked it into my normal brushing routine and had forgotten about it.  I started to notice my teeth seemed whiter, and I couldn\'t figure out why.  I started thinking about it and realized the only change was the brush head and more powerful motor.  (my toothpaste was the same)."

Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week\'s time, in my case of twice daily use. While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful! Not only is this toothbrush built for home use, it\'s the one you won\'t want to be without wherever you go.I especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I\'m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds. The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who\'ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have... yet I found I can get used to the sonic sensations, and I even feel that my gums and teeth are gaining strength, cleanliness and overall health. Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.So just how compact is this toothbrush? At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one\'s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing. The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth. The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.The directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I\'ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do). Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question. This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush I don\'t want to live without!  Highly, highly recommended."

Those are shaped more like a conventional toothbrush, rectangular,rather than round like this unit.  I always thought the Cross Action did a good enough job so I never splurged on a more expensive unit.  Well, after trying the Oral-b 3000, I find I like the 3000 much better.  I have less of a tendency to \'brush\' my teeth with the 3000, and I know you aren\'t supposed to brush with an electric toothbrush, just move the brush around slowly.  Being smaller in head size, it is easier to maneuver and I feel it does a better job getting  to all the teeth surfaces.  I love the added bonus of the 30 second timer on  the 3000.  At first I thought something was wrong when every 30 seconds it would seem like the toothbrush was powering down, but it just is a timer to let you know to move on.  It has a 2 minute timer so you can focus on doing 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  How fun is that!  The red \'too much pressure\' light is also handy, and I had to push pretty hard to get to light up, such that is was uncomfortable on my teeth.  Some of you may need the warning light, but the pain was enough for me to stop the pressure.  I do like this toothbrush, but I also agree that it is costly and buying replacement heads are costly, so it is a continuing investment.  Still, these clean so much better than manual toothbrushes.  My kids have been using them for years and between the two of them they have had 1 cavity.  So perhaps these do pay for themselves in the long run."

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for four Flexisoft EB17 heads for $24.99 (The EB17-4 just means there are four of them).

Appropriate markings and all that.I have used all the brush head types, and thought that \'sensitive\' meant these would be gentle but still effective.  Switched to this brush head for a couple weeks.  When hubby asked for whitening toothpaste, I noticed that we were both experiencing staining, something that hasn\'t happened since we\'ve owned a power brush.  Thanks to lots of coffee and tea, I can *see* ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health.  Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth are back to normal now.I would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).

I got it when Oral-B had the 50% rebate promo running, and Amazon was selling it for just $99.99.  So getting it for $50 was a steal of a deal.It cleans perfectly and I have noticed whiter teeth in just a few weeks of use.  I will never go back to normal manual brushes and can\'t believe I hadn\'t bought this earlier!  My teeth honestly look and feel healthier than ever and like they all say, it does feel like i just stepped out of the dentist\'s office.  Buy it, it\'ll save you wonders on dental bills and all but ensure you won\'t have teeth problems, gingivitis, etc.  I use the \'sensitive\' mode to brush my tongue as well, and the \'massage\' mode helps strengthen your gums and feels good too.  The extra brush head that\'s included is awesome, and the display helps you see how long you\'ve been brushing, what mode you\'re on, and also functions as an extra bathroom clock :)All in all, very satisfied with this purchase.

I find that most soft brushes don\'t do enough in removing grit and tartar from my teeth. So, when I tried this, I was about to give it away or throw it in the trash. But, then I did a double-take and ran my tongue across my teeth and looked at them carefully in the mirror. And, whaddyah know? It got every little speckle off of my teeth. It made them feel polished like I had just got out of the dentist. This is the first gentle toothbrush that I\'ve used that actually works well.

It produces a STRONG vibration...VERY strong.  Not for the young child or the sensitive mouth.  I seriously felt like I\'d put a power drill into my mouth!That being said, I\'d have to say it is worth the uncomfortable feeling (which I\'m starting to get used to) -- even after just the first use, my teeth looked shiny and polished, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  And despite the strong vibration, I didn\'t have any issues with my gums bleeding.  I think it just takes some getting used to, especially if, like me, you\'re not used to using a power toothbrush.So I would say that the only downside is that you can\'t control the level of vibration -- it\'s either on or off.  Sometimes it would be nice to turn it down a bit (especially in the morning...though I guess it\'s an effective way to wake up!).  ;-)  Adjustable power levels would make this a 5-star product.  It would also be nice if it had an indicator light that tells you when it\'s fully charged or charging."

They do come loose and fall off in my mouth, there is not the same vibrating motion, they are a little rough. Also, I closely compared an off brand one to an Oral-B and found that there are less bristles on the cheaper one. The bristles are in little groups: Oral B=26, offbrand=18. So, you get what you pay for, I am afraid. Still, Oral B could be kinder and charge less for these simple little things, we know it costs very little to make them. Note: there should be \'Oral B\' inscribed on the arm of the replacement brush heads. If it is not there, it is definitely not theirs."

By way of full disclosure, I have been using the Oral B Cross-action toothbrush for a number of months, and in the past I used a Sonicare toothbrush.For whatever reason, I keep seeing more and more electric toothbrushes lately, each of which is supposed to be the \'latest and greatest\' design.  Frankly, I can\'t see the difference between many of them.  Maybe there are incremental changes that make them worth the sometimes excessive cost, but who knows?  And of course, manufacturers seem to be pretty generous with dental offices, which seem to either display the Oral B brand or Sonicare, or both.  But I suspect that the results between the various brands are pretty similar.This toothbrush is very similar to my Cross-action, the key differences being (i) it lacks the cross action brushes below the oscillating head, (ii) it has a 2 minute timer, and (iii) it\'s rechargable.  Frankly, I prefer the cross-action brushes, but that\'s not crically important.  I do really like the 2 minute timer, and the fact it\'s rechargable.  It does a good job cleaning, and the timer is a nice feature.From my perspective, I don\'t think that the brushes that sell for $70+ are worth the money.  Far from it.  The Cross action does a fine job on my teeth, and this brush is pretty comparable, with the added plusses of being rechargable and having the two minute timer.  So I think this is a good buy for the money, and I would recommend it.  I also like the fact that there are a variety of different heads available for it, including ones that floss, are gentle, etc.I\'d say that this brush is a very good value for the money."

Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price. So I asked myself, \'How bad can they be\'?The brush heads I received looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense). When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example. On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth). These brush heads have very poor motion constraint. The circular brush can easily \'slide\' around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).Not only that, but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing. As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \'knock-off\', more interested in looking like the original than acting like it.My advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads. Your mouth and your dentist will thank you."

This Oral-B Pulsonic feels very comfortable in my mouth; the brush head is very small.  There are two modes, clean and sensitive, which I really like.  At first the clean mode was too strong on my teeth and I switched to the sensitive mode.  Now I\'m used to the clean mode, but use the sensitive mode behind my teeth where it\'s more gentle on my gums. It also has a very small brush head for in between teeth; somewhat like flossing. It has 30-second timers (not a beep, a hesitation) to let you know when to switch to another section of teeth if you want to.  My teeth feel very clean and tartar free after brushing.  The only reason I\'m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are NO replacement brush heads; even though it recommends replacing them every three months.  It really should include at least one set of brush heads.  All in all, a good product and I would recommend it."

It takes a few days to get used to not using the same rigorous back and forth brushing action, but you get used to it. The secret is in the reciprocating action that allows the brush to get between teeth in ways a normal brush cannot. It also cleans those tough back molars extremely well. The included charger is also 110-220v which is a nice feature for someone who travels a lot and lives in Europe like myself. I was also a little apprehensive about the wireless timer/clock, but after using it for awhile it makes a lot of sense and I like using it. I wish they would include an alarm clock or multiple timezones in future iterations to make it more travel friendly and usable. If there were any downside to this toothbrush it would be in it\'s travel \'footprint\'. Although the case is very nice and holds the brush and two heads, its much larger than a regular brush and will take up more space while traveling. The additional wireless timer adds additional packing requirements (which is why I recommend that they add some more features to the clock to make it more usable and travel friendly). If you don\'t travel much, then the size will be fine for your bathroom and the included stand is nice, functional, and compact. Overall, I strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to bring their oral hygiene to the next level. It\'s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but I guarantee your teeth will feel considerably cleaner and look whiter after using it for only a week or two. Great product!"

Additionally I find their recharge mechanism ingenious, there are no connectors, near as I can tell, it must use a magetic field. What I mean is that the recharge station and linking area on the brush are all both entirely covered in plastic, so there are no \'vulnerable\' spots for bathroom water to reach to short things out or gum up the works.I also find that I take longer brushing my teeth when I use an electric brush, I\'m not sure why I do so, I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.There is one major design flaw though. The moving bristle head has too much clearance between it and the rest of the brush, because it regularly, at least once a day, pinches the inside of my lips or cheeks, often to the point of breaking the skin, and at least once a week bad enough to make my spit turn completely red.It could be that my brush head is defective, I don\'t know, but it definitely happens, and it never happened with any of my previous electric toothbrushes."

Batteries last 3-5 years (meaning 3 years), AND once the battery is exhausted and no longer holds a charge, you have to throw away the entire unit.The company\'s explanation is that the unit is water tight so removing the battery breaks that seal. This is horrific design flaw - if they wanted they could allow for battery replacement.BUT...allowing battery replacement means you wouldn\'t have to BUY AN ENTIRE NEW UNIT.So...essentially the consumer is being held hostage to a company that\'s designed a product that has to be thrown away.LASTLY...there is no easy means of recycling. I was told I had to go to a Braun service center. On Long Island. 30+ miles away. That\'s irresponsible. A company should stand behind their product; offer, at the very least, a reasonable outlet to recycle something. If you build in \'planned obsolescence\' at least give the customer an easy means to recycle the darn thing.And, like I said, design a product where the battery can be replaced.

So its intended circular motion no longer worked well.  So i though maybe it was just a bad one.  I got out the next one, and 2 weeks latter. Same thing happened.  So i compared it to a genuine one from walmart, and noticed some differences.  It was missing a serial number through the little window on the back, and the plastic piece up in the inside was different as well.

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It\'s kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

There are some pros and cons to this brush, specifically, there is no light to indicate that the brush is charging or when it\'s charged.  The pulsonic has a light that just shows when it\'s charging.  The pubsonic has a larger brush head but this brush gives a deeper clean, which is also somewhat of a downside due to the noise that\'s produced by the power behind the brush.  I thought the smaller surface area of the brush-head would make it an inferior product but I can\'t say that\'s the case.  With this price, this toothbrush is a pretty good investment."

I honestly thought it was just something wrong with my toothbruth.  I figured it was just a little off and causing damage to the heads.  So this weekend I began to look into buying a new toothbruth when I came across all the articles about the fake brushheads.  Sure enough, the descriptions of the fake merchandise matched what I had.  So I\'ve been using fake heads for a year.  I contacted Amazon and after 30 minutes and having to speak to the manager they refunded only the ones bought directly from Amazon.  They said since I had purchased them so long ago this was a \'special exception\' they were making for me.  I don\'t even really care about the money so much as I care about taking responsibility for it.  Amazon should be at least somewhere responsible for the quality of their products and even of the resellers.  Refunding or contacting the reseller is the least they can do in my opinion.  The manager has forwarded my story to the inventory department and if I receive a call back I will update here.  Thanks everyone.Update: I haven\'t heard yet from Amazon, but I called Oral B.  They took this much more seriously.  At Amazon I got the feeling they thought I was scamming them, but Oral B took all my information, refunded me, and is looking into it.

While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist."

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is currently for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $9.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are 3 of them).  There are other offers through Amazon for this exact same item for up to $19.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!  Currently, this listing is the best price for this item, but it might not always be in the future."

The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare\'s."

Today it costs $60 on amazon while the Oral-B Pulsonic costs $47.  If you are in the market for a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I\'d say either of these would be a good investment.  Both have two settings, except it seems the Oral-B has the \'faster\' setting start first whereas the WaterPik starts a slower speed first.  The Oral-B is slimmer, lighter, easier to hold onto.  Both brushes come with base units but the unit for the Oral-B is smaller and lighter than that of the WaterPik, but it also is easier to push around by accident.  The WaterPik comes with 2 brush heads, the Oral-B, just one.  When recharging the WaterPik blinks and when it stops, you know it has been charged fully, the Oral-B does not.I have not experienced the trouble of the brush head falling off the Oral-B brush, and overall I would say that the Oral-B seems more \'powerful\' in its vibrations.  I can\'t say that\'s a bad thing, but after using the WaterPik for so long, it\'s something one has to get used to.  Overall I\'d say either electric brush is a good investment.  While you get a little more with the WaterPik, it is also a heavier brush and more expensive.  In the end, all they really do is vibrate and you have to move them around.  If I had a choice, I\'d probably choose the Oral-B (which I switched to as soon as I received it), only because it\'s slimmer and lighter and I find it easier to use."

In the early 80s I had gum surgery because of it. I\'m supposed to go to the dentist every four months for a cleaning, but of course I don\'t go to the dentist near that often; maybe once a year if I\'m lucky. Anyway I always have a large plaque buildup when I finally do go to the dentist for a cleaning. The last several times I\'ve gone to the University of Pittsburgh school of dentistry where dental hygiene students do the work and the instructors check their work and correct the cleaning if necessary. Anyway I\'ve never had better cleanings in my life, but I still get severe plaque between cleanings. The last time I went the instructor recommended the Oral B 5000 toothbrush for my plaque problem. I thought I\'d give it a try and to say I\'m pleased is an understatement. I\'ve been using it now for five weeks after my last cleaning and as of yet I can feel no plaque buildup on my teeth. In the past by this time after a cleaning the plaque was starting to form when I used a regular toothbrush. I use the included timer and clean my teeth for a total of about 2 1/2 minutes. The feature I like is that you can get the molars clean. This was always a problem area for me in the past. Also the toothbrush will slowdown or stop if you press too hard. After a week or so you know what kind of pressure to apply and hone your cleaning technique. I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has a plaque or gum problem. One final note; I don\'t keep the charger plugged in all the time. I charge the toothbrush and can use it for eight or nine days before recharging. I\'m old school on this and feel the battery will last much longer if not charging all the time. I might be wrong on this, but I know at the very least it won\'t hurt battery life."

Upon receiving the toothbrush, I was a little surprised at how large the handle is, but the brush heads are small enough to move around and focus on one tooth at a time, which is awesome. The polishing head is amazing, with the right toothpaste it feels like a dentist\'s cleaning! The flossing head seems to do its job, the long rubber flappers seem to reach further into the crevices between my teeth than an average toothbrush, although it is no substitute for actually flossing. Within the first couple days of owning this toothbrush I can already notice a difference in  my teeth, they feel amazingly clean and already look a touch whiter.

This brush is simply light-years beyond the old Oral B 3D! It seems more powerful and even more effective (another plus: this model can use the same brushes [Oral B Precision Clean] as my older model, so leftovers won\'t go to waste. This model also accepts other more specialized Oral B brushes).Many thanks to B. Johnson for pointing out the value of the SmartGuide. For me as well, it serves as a neat little bathroom clock. But the most surprising thing is that by breaking down the recommended two-minute brushing cycle into four groups of 30 seconds each (via a simple but effective circular visual cue), the SmartGuide makes the entire process seem to go by faster. (With old-style brushes, the usual two minutes of unstructured brushing casts you upon a veritable ocean of time. I was always surprised by how long it took for the brush to stutter its two-minute signal. Oftentimes, I just stopped when I felt like it!) You always know (1) exactly where you are in the cycle and (2) when to move on to the next quadrant. This unwittingly clever bit of psychology gives you a sense of making clearly defined progress and ensures that you\'re devoting equal time to all sectors of your mouth. I brush for the full two minutes now, with no sense of impatience. In fact, the experience is so pleasant that I almost always do a final general sweep for another 30 seconds or so.One more interesting detail: perhaps because of its higher speed, this brush seems to prevent water and toothpaste from dripping along the brush shaft. I used to have to put my chin up to minimize this minor annoyance with the old Braun. But after several weeks of using the 5000 (with chin still up but not so extremely), I\'ve not had a single drip.I\'ve always been a faithful tooth-brusher, but ever since I got my first electric brush, brushing has been so much fun that I look forward to it. This terrific toothbrush takes the experience to a whole new level. And most important of all, it cleans and stimulates better than anything else I\'ve ever used."

2655,2720,20100920,B003UKKHB4,5,"September 20, 2010",A3VYKXHQDICC6,Excellent,"I have been an Oral-B electric toothbrush user for the last 15 years. I have written Amazon reviews for Oral-B products dating back to 2002. I have had very few dental issues in this time although, in fairness, I must also report that I began daily flossing during this time as well, and that may be just as important.This new model is a definite step up from the ancient \'Plak Control Plus\' model that I had been using. It\'s full name is \'Professional Care 3000\' and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument. The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one. Please note that this is not an ultrasonic toothbrush. Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action. The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth very quickly.The 3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button. The first is \'Daily Clean\' which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis. The second is \'Sensitive\' which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth. The third is \'Whitening\' which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \'Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\'The instructions that come with the 3000 recommend that you brush for 2 minutes - no less and no more. To assist you with this, once you turn the brush on it will pulse twice every 30 seconds. If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you\'ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times. To turn the brush off from any mode, just press and hold the on/off button.Built into the 3000 is a \'Hard Brushing Alert\' which is an LED on the handle that lights up if you are pressing too hard. Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth. Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly. The instructions say that the LED is, \'Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\' so apparently there\'s a dental health issue here as well. The brush is very powerful, so it\'s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.The brush comes with a charging stand and covered storage tray that can accommodate 4 brush heads. The storage tray is dishwasher-safe, the charging stand is not."

I had read about third party seller selling fake brush head refills, but since the price wasn\'t ridiculously low, I thought that they had to be genuine oral-B brush heads.  However, as soon as I looked at the brushes through the clear package, I could tell that the brushes are knock-offs.  I had recently bought the same exact 3-pack from a store, so I compared the ones I got to the genuine oral-B refills, and noticed the following: the bristles are not really standing straight up like the real ones, the center bristles are of different color, and even the \'oral-B\' trademark on the brushes are of different color (the trademark should be blue, but the one on the fake brushes are gray) and small than the real ones.  the packaging looks almost the same (the fake package even says the brushes were \'made in Germany\'), but there are subtle differences: the font on the back of the package is much thicker than that on the real one, the \'2\' attached to the 2nd picture on the back of the package is lacking the shadow, and the pictures are fuzzy.

2858,2934,20100826,B003UKM90Q,4,"August 26, 2010",ALXFN5BF1H691,Not bad for a cheap rotating brush,"I\'ve used one of Oral-B\'s more upscale models for a while (the 8900 DLX), so I was curious how the value models would do. And it\'s really not too bad for $30.First, you have to realize that if you\'re moving from a normal brush you have to re-learn how to brush. No more moving the brush rapidly with your hand - press the button on the handle and it starts whirling at high speed. Press the brush to your teeth and gums and sloooowly move it left to right or right to left. Make sure you get all three sides of top and bottom, and that you get the gumlines - that\'s the most important part. Obviously it doesn\'t really matter what order you do it in, but if I don\'t keep a pattern I get distracted by pets or people and forget. After two minutes the brush will briefly stop the motor a few times to let you know you\'ve brushed enough - next time you can adjust your movement speed to hit that mark.It includes an induction charger - just set the handle on it. You can do it every night or once a week.So how does this $30 model compare to the $90-120 models? Well, the grip is noticably cheaper, with no rubber grip stripes. The induction charger is very easy to tip over compared to the sturdier \'well\' model. There\'s no charge indicator. The whole thing feels a little bit more flimsy than the 8900, though it never felt like it would actually come apart. There\'s no 30 second indicator like the better models, and there\'s only one speed, though I never found the other speeds on the 8900 useful anyhow.All in all not bad for $30 - of course they\'ll get you for $3-4 each for replacement head, but that\'s only every 3 months or so, and this comes with one head and one spare head. And I think you\'ll do a better job with this than with a regular brush - it\'s very easy to pay for itself if you just get one fewer cavity. If you want one of the above features spring for a better model, but this isn\'t bad for 1/3rd the cost."

These toothbrushes also feature  electronics that keep the motor voltage constant - and hence maintain optimal orbital brushing speed - even as the battery voltage declines as they discharge. So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops. So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries! This feature also means despite the lower voltage of using 2x 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, you get the same brushing speed and power as using 2x 1.5V Alkaline cells. This is great! as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.Build quality of the units is great as you\'d expect for a Braun, even for a cheaper unit. The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section. This guarantees moisture vapour can\'t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term service.The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can\'t get into the internals.The 2-minute timer is a nice feature. At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing but if you wan\'t to keep brushing, you can as it doesnt turn the motor off.Overall this brush is great, especially for the price. The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific. The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber. All these problems are remedied with this Braun model."

I bought 3000 series and instantly noted that it was of much better quality than the Vitality.  The brush is super strong, and a red LED will indicate if you\'re brushing too hard. Another bonus is that Oral-B redesigned the charging base, making it much easier to clean than previous generations.My only real complaint is that the brush will indicate when 30 seconds has passed by stopping, then restarting suddenly. That feature (meant to alert you when it\'s time to brush a different quadrant of your mouth) is somewhat irritating as it feels like the batteries have run out momentarily. I would prefer a chime or LED indicator.  Other than that, it\'s a decent choice of electric toothbrush."

Recently it was time to order a new supply and I noticed that they had changed the name of the product to \'Extra Gentle\'. Seeing that they were still saying this was for canker sore sufferers I bought several tubes. Almost immediately after I started using this product I had one canker sore after another. I then changed to another SLS free brand and everything has healed up and is back to normal. My thoughts are that either this new product is worthless for preventing canker sores or I got a bad batch that had SLS in it. Attempts to contact the company through the \'contact us\' section of their web site have failed. I guess I\'ll be throwing away several tubes of this not inexpensive toothpaste.1/22 Edit - A few days after posting this review Rembrandt responded to my complaint to them about this product. We\'re in the process of returning the toothpaste for coupons for other Rembrandt products. Better that throwing them away I suppose.

Just a week ago (Feb 16, 2012) the battery had gone dead on it. I was pretty happy considering it lasted over 6 years. Granted it was a little more expensive than the 5000, I still expect this SmartSeries to perform as good if not better. When reading the manual on this toothbrush I seen the section on the battery in it. It gave instructions on what to do if and when the battery goes dead on it. I tried to perform the procedure on my old Sonicare since they have the same basic structure. I couldn\'t seem to open the bottom of it and any suggestions would be great. However, I don\'t even know if the battery on that model is even replaceable. When I first turned on the SmartSeries 5000 I noticed a BIG difference that my old Sonicare. The sound was extremely different. The Sonicare had a tight buzzing sound that sounded very well built. The 5000 had more of a loose buzz. It is a bit louder and makes me question if its going to last half the time my old toothbrush did. Who knows, maybe this is a new addition that cleans your teeth better or maybe I\'m just so used to my old one that I question anything different. The Smart Guide system on this brush is pretty cool. If you have kids, it will definitely make them want to brush. There\'s a smiley face that gets bigger and bigger the longer your brush. You can stick the Smart Guide screen onto a mirror or the wall. The toothbrush also has a monitor in it that lets you know if you\'re brushing too hard. There is a red light that is very noticeable on the handle that lights up when your pushing too hard. It is compatible with 5 different brush heads that supposedly do different things. I don\'t know if this is just a selling point or what but I find it pretty handy. Overall, there is not much difference in the 1000, 1500, 3000, or 5000. Just a couple additions the higher the number but the basic stuff is going to be there with all of them. If I had to do it over I would have gotten a cheaper one. I thought getting the biggest and best one would have more advantages. It\'s still a good buy and I have no complaints as of yet."

But to my delight, I found these replacement brushes. So now my toothbrush is still working as well as it did when I first bought it! I also like it that the set includes the tiny brush for cleaning between teeth too! I would say this is a little pricey at $20, which averages out to about $5 per brush, but it was worth it to have them so I wouldn\'t have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush--and a brush, I might add, that is my all-time favorite, especially since it has the \'sensitive\' teeth speed.

I didn\'t weigh them, but the Pulsonic is definitely lighter than my Sonicare brush. I also appreciate the fact that the Pulsonic comes with an extra brush head for deep cleaning, along with the standard charger. The basic brush head\'s shape does more for me than the Sonicare\'s as well.The Bad: Unfortunately, I just never felt like the Pulsonic was vibrating/cleaning as hard as my Sonicare. Instead of holding it in place and letting the brush do the work, the Pulsonic requires a fair amount of manual manipulation, during which the brush head can disengage from the main unit.The Verdict: It\'s slicker and cheaper than the competition, but in this case I think you\'re better off spending your money on the deeper cleaning, more reliable Sonicare line."

It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than \'brushing\' like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).2- It\'s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.3- If it pops out of your mouth while it\'s running, it doesn\'t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.4- It doesn\'t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever?

And then, there is the rare product that comes along which goes beyoyond the hype and acclaim. And which exceeds all expectations. Allow me to introduce to you the latter, the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush. I will not take up too much time by reiterating all the 5-star reviews. But do read these reviews; because they are right on the money. One review in particular claimed how using this product cured his bad breath problem. This claim really got my attention. I too suffered from bad breath. And no amount of brushing or tongue scraping would solve the problem of bad breath. So this claim along with many of the other positive reviews persuaded me to give the Oral-B a try. Results...Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Upon initial use it felt like I had been to the dentist office for a dental cleaning (and like so every time after use). And yes...no more bad breath...simply amazing!  Is the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush worth the price? Consider the convenience of getting a truly professional dental cleaning (at home) without having to go to a Dental Hygienist. Also, consider the cost involved of going to a dental hygienist for cleaning every six months or so. The Oral-B is worth the price many many many times over.  Note: If you have not had cleaning for a while (or not good cleaning), you may experience slight bleeding of the gums for a couple of weeks of use. As the toothbrush rids your dentals of the old and new trapped food particles (which will turn to plaque via bacteria if not cleaned of), you will experience bleeding less and less until no more. Be advised, the sticker that attaches the timer/clock to a surface, like a wall, is of industrial strength. When it sticks it stays sticked. You may pull away some of your wall, or other used surface, if you try to remove it after sticking it on. Like me, you may choose not to use sticker and just place timer/clock on sink counter-top (or a stand for eye level). However, I now use the timer/clock as a bathroom clock mostly. Because the the Oral-B toothbrush device also has a built-in timer guide. The quadrant cleaning method illustrated in the user manual seemed a bit tedious for me. I have developed a more desirable method for myself. This procedure is as follows: starting from the top chop going left outer...moving to back then going inner around to other side until at that back then around that outer side to where I started (spending a second or two on each tooth). And likewise with my bottom chop. Time-wise, the whole procedure takes around two minutes or so. You can follow the user manual guide or develop your own strategy. The main thing is to make sure that you reach all tooth and gum areas (top and bottom chops; inner and outer surfaces, and top of dentals).  Now then! How quickly should you get the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush? Don\'t walk. Don\'t skip or hop! Don\'t even run!! But warp-speed!!! And seek a desirable  merchant to acquire this dental magician."

Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  The icing on the cake is the low price of this brush. Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  This is an excellent product. 4.5 Stars*** Positive Points: ***- Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)- Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3). The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).- It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base. You simply stick the raised portion of the charger into the end of the brush.- Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries- Brush vibrates to let you know when you have gone over the recommended 2 minute brush time.- 2 year warranty*** Negative Points: ***- Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.- There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.- The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouthOverall:  This toothbrush cannot be beat for its price.  I deducted half a star because there is no indicator light telling you the battery status, though this is a minor issue."

That brush does a great job, but brush heads are expensive and a little on the hard side.  Every time I brush my teeth with that one, the sink looks like a crime scene by the time I am finished.

If this toothbrush is anything like my previous Oral B purchases, it will be with me for a long time.One should keep in mind that the replacement heads for these toothbrushes is not cheap. I would also compare them to the price you pay for cartridges as the manufacturer looks to minimize the initial outlay (as is the case with printers) while cashing in later. I still think that this product accomplishes much more than a conventional toothbrush and that in the end it does not turn out to be as expensive when compared to how long these refills last."

I thought it might be time to try something new, and I am glad I did. This brush is far better than my previous one, to the point that I have to order a second one since my wife already stole mine for herself!Here are the details, mostly in comparison to the Crest SpinBrush I was using before.The good:* Rechargeable - big plus for me. I\'ve gone through a lot of batteries on the Crest brush.* Variety of replaceable heads - currently using the Vitality Floss Action but like the availability of other styles* 2-minute timer - automatically tells you after 2 minutes of brushing, great way to build that habit* Good speed, not too fast or slow, just feels right* Mouth feels cleaner after this brush than with my previous spinbrushThe Not-so-good:* No indicator for battery life - It is designed with the expectation that most people will leave it plugged in all the time, but I prefer to run my batteries down between charges and I didn\'t get much warning when it quit in the middle of a brush one night.Other than that, I love this brush. I\'m glad it came with an extra brush head since my wife wanted to try it as well. Now I just need to order one for her so that we can stop trying to share. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a low-cost electric toothbrush."

I don\'t know if newer Sonicare toothbrushes have a different design. I used the Sonicare Elite for many years until the nickel-cadmium battery died. I didn\'t notice the inferior design of the Sonicare until I started using the Oral-B 5000. The Sonicare has fat plastic at the brush end which is not as comfortable as the slim Oral-B brush head. The Sonicare has a fat and elaborate interface between the base and the removable brushing unit, which is not as easy to keep clean as the slim and simple interface of the Oral-B. And the Oral-B brushing part of the two types of brush included in the box does a better cleaning job. Finally, we have battery disposal. The Sonicare has a non-removable Ni-Cad battery, so that in order to dispose of it properly at a recycling center I had to cut the base to access the battery. The Oral-B has a provision for removing the nickel-metal hydride battery (better than Ni-Cad), although the manufacturer wants you to stop using the unit when the battery dies, not to replace it."

It gets every speck of plaque off of my teeth, even in the hard to reach areas.  Unlike an old powered toothbrush I once had, it doesn\'t require a special toothpaste, and can use your favorite kind.  Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  I\'m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time. (You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about oral hygiene.)The toothbrush comes with a sealed plastic charger, which will charge the brush overnight.  A full charge will give you a week\'s worth of brushing. (14 x 2 minutes) This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.  You can also store the brush on the charger, but this isn\'t the most ecological way of charging the brush.  It also comes with one refill, and additional refills are available here on Amazon."

But after adjusting to the weird feel of something electrical in contact with the moisture in your mouth, and the buzzing vibrating sensations on your teeth, it didn\'t take too long to get the hang of it.You still need to do some serious flossing, and ?I think this device might even be pushing some food particles into those post-molar crevices, so don\'t forget to use the Interdental brush and floss in there too.So far, it seems like an easy modern way to ensure basic dental hygiene, and I\'m satisfied with the results.

From the first time I brushed with this Oral B 5000, I was astonished at how clean my teeth felt.  I honestly think they felt even cleaner than when I would have them cleaned at the dentist.  I even find myself brushing a third time some days, just for the great feeling.  My only disappointment with the unit is that I didn\'t clearly understand it only came with one brush head.  My husband utilized that Floss Head while I waited a few days for our set of 4 Precision Clean Brush Heads came in.  (I think that the floss head would have been too large for my mouth, so I did not order those for us.)  Using the simple Precision Clean heads, my mouth feels terrific.  While I have had gum problems in the past, I find less bleeding with this brush than my manual toothbrush which I had been using.  As some others have noted, my teeth are markedly whiter in perhaps only a week of use, with my usual whitening toothpaste I will add.  I do like the little remote timer.  I thought it more for my kids, but I truly like seeing the time rack up.  I now think I will be using the Deep Cleaning (3 minute) setting as I am never quite done with each quadrant before it beeps and pauses to alert me.  I am unsure how the whitening (pulsing mode) helps, but I use it after a full brushing, and it certainly isn\'t hurting.  My family of four is now happily using this unit.

I originally had planned on purchasing a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush but after reading many different reviews, decided on the Oral-B instead.  The clock/timer is a nice feature, makes me more aware of how much time I spend on different sections of teeth.  The motor hesitates when too much pressure is applied which is also a plus for me as I have a tendency to press too hard.  I\'ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don\'t use the stand that it came with but it\'s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn\'t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I\'ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.

It also helps you not to hurt your gum, becease if you put to much pressure on your teeth, the viewer make an alarm to help you to know when to stop.  I use the toothbrush when I am in the shower.

It just died before Christmas, and I decided to try this Oral-B.  I was not unhappy with the Sonicare, but now that I am using the Oral-B, I feel this one is far better.  I like how I can actually feel the round toothbrush clean each individual tooth.  I like the little timer that tells me when to go to the next section of my mouth.  It really goes by even faster that way- I thought it was going to be complicated, but it is much easier.  I like how the top part removes easily.  I pop it off after I use it and put it in its covered little tray.  This is an awesome toothbrush!  I am so glad I bought it!  And the price was very reasonable too!"

The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  There are no recesses to collect toothpaste, moisture etc., so it is easy to keep clean.  I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...my whole mouth.  It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone. I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \'between\' brush would be a good thing to use. The only change I would make would be to slant the head a bit to enable reaching inside surfaces.  All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...in fact it is still working. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the Sonicare, but for the money, this is the best buy. After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  AND, I do not work for Oral B.  Come on...get real paranoid people...09/10/09:  I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  I have not had this problem.  I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed and I can see where that might create the above mentioned problem.  I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  Just food for thought if trying to decide on this product.  I still love it."

Then we went back to manual toothbrushes for a while.  We realized that the manual toothbrushes didn\'t leave our mouths feeling as clean as the rechargeable toothbrushes, so we decided to purchase a Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.We purchased the Sonicare from Amazon and tried it for a couple weeks.  At first, we thought it did a very good job cleaning our teeth and gums, but it started feeling weak.  I\'m not sure if the toothbrush lost its full power after the first week, but the pulsating just didn\'t seem as good as our older Oral B.We returned it to Amazon as it seemed defective, and purchased the Oral B Professional Series 5000.  We\'ve used it for a few days now and it draws rings around the Sonicare.  The oscillating motion of the toothbrush alone leaves our teeth, gums, and overall mouth feeling much cleaner than anything we\'ve ever used; feels almost as good as a cleaning from the dentist.I highly recommend this toothbrush over the Sonicare.  Also, we are using the Oral B Floss brush heads.  They are tremendous and are much cheaper than the Sonicare brush heads as well."

It also helped at the time that there was a 50% rebate from Oral-B (which was received in 3 weeks, not bad for a rebate). So for one, it was a good deal at a post-rebate of $54.99.This was a perfect set-up for my husband and me. It came with a floss head and I already had a whitening brush head. When we unpacked, we set it up next to the counter plug (I don\'t like to have wires spread everywhere) and placed the timer on the mirror at my eye level.The timer shows a round diagram (to represent your mouth) and it times 30 seconds a section. Then you get a big smile and a wink for the time after 2 minutes. The timer display also shows what mode you are like normal or gentle and if you are brushing too hard.The brush has been working well for both my husband and I. The brush does make noise, and since there is not doorseparating our sink from the bedroom, I do have to go into the enclosed toilet/ bathtub room to brush when my husband is sleeping. Also, there is only one brush so you either have to brush one after another or use another oral-B professional brush, which we already had (the Professional 1000).My husband dentist thanked him for flossing (which he doesn\'t), and my dentist said that my gums looked a lot healthier and my teeth were very white. My dentist even is going to order me 2 new brush heads every time I come in (about every 6 months) instead of the standard toothbrush.I would recommend this brush to everyone. I know that all can\'t afford them, so I tell them to watch for rebates, when you can get them cheap. They save you at the dentist (with less cavities).

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $19.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are three of them).

A crest representative came to my office, presented information that made sense and had literature that this brush was the only toothbrush to show increased efficacy in independent testing.  Anyway I bought several for my parents and myself and have been impressed.What I like:-Makes your teeth \'feel\' noticeably cleaner, like they feel when they\'ve just been cleaned at the dental office-Wireless display motivates me to brush longer than I normally would, I\'ll be honest I don\'t know where they got the recommended 2 minute timeframe, but I do it to see the smiley face on the indicator-Wireless display has PRESSURE INDICATOR; I diagnose wear on teeth at the gum line multiple times everyday.  If this is an issue for you get this brush.  It\'ll save you money at the dentist and stop you from harming your teeth-Well made, handle is thin and ergonomic, charger has a small footprint on the counter, no electrical components exposed and everything feels sturdy-Wide selection of brush heads that are reasonably priced ($40 for a 2 year supply at Costco).  Two heads stand out to me.  The first is the funky looking one, which actually provides a floss like action between teeth.  NOT a substitute for flossing but I have noticed considerably less debris removed when I do floss after using this brush.  Also there is an orthodontic (braces) brush that gets in-between the teeth and the braces.  If you are plunking down the thousands for your child to have braces get this brush / attachment, otherwise when the braces a removed there is a good chance the teeth will have unsightly white halos around where the brackets were which is actually decalcification which is the start of cavities.Overall I\'m very impressed with this brush so it is most defiantly \'dentist recommended\' by myself.

The order came from TeethNthings.  The product was packed ok but I received it banged up.  The postal worker wanted to blame it on poor packaging but it was packaged fine.  The product itself was fine.I have been using this product for a couple of days now so I must report that I am overall very happy and satisfied with it.  I read over the instructions twice, and when I used it for the first time, I was puzzled when I felt it doing small pauses.  The instructions are ok.  They could have broken it down dummy-style for some of us but oh well.  I was a bit confused about how to set the timing part, but I figured it out.  It could have been the excitement.If you buy this product, it will do these short pulses every two minutes.  After two minutes of brushing, the smiley comes up and winks.  So cute.  If you reach 4 minutes of brushing, it will do the pulse thing again.  There is a DVD that comes with it to explain their brushing technique of using the brush.  They break it down in 4 quadrants, 30 second intervals, two get in at least 2 minutes of brushing.The toothbrush itself is a tad bit noisier and heavier than my old ancient basic one, but let me tell you, boy does it go.  I feel like my teeth are getting a serious dental treatment, Spa Dente\'.  I don\'t know what this toothbrush will leave for the dentist to do, besides exrays.  To switch between the different brushing styles, you will push the triangle button while the brush is on.  The detached screen thing will tell you.  I use it in sensitive mode.  If you are brushing too hard, it will flash red.  Be careful not to push it while brushing, as it would seem easy to do.I really really love how they have the charger.  It is small and not bulky, which is perfect for travel.  Pretty smart how they did that.  The charger base is your travel base as well.  I really really love the blue travel case that it comes with so you can store two brush heads.  That is so neat.The best thing about this toothbrush is that it really gets your teeth, gums and mouth clean.  The smell of my breath has improved also.  It does a wonderful job.

151,154,20100609,B00006ANDK,4,"June 9, 2010",A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX,"Gentle, but wish it was recyclable, like Preserve","I am a huge fan of powered toothbrushes - my mouth just doesn\'t feel as clean when I use a manual toothbrush. I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that\'s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference! I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads. They feel softer on my gums and so I think they are a gentler choice. I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth. I have been using these heads for almost 10 years and often get compliments at the dentist. Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums. Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best. I\'m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn\'t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth & gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.I do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect. I\'ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months. I find that the blue begins to fade after one month. I think I\'m an average brusher (twice or more daily) and I even have two toothbrushes I switch between (depending on which is charged & what bathroom I\'m in), so I would think that the indicator would last longer.This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE! Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (& recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual. (If you\'re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve. They sell plates, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, razors, etc. & I do really like their razors) I know that plastic recycling isn\'t the best thing for the environment, but it\'s gotta be better than throwing all these heads in the trash/dump/ocean... I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they\'re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.) But, I can only keep so many. Anyway, that\'s why I give this product 4 stars, instead of 5. Gentle, but wish they were recycled & recyclable.Many thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)"

I have a very expensive Sonicare which has the major drawback of being very bulky. This Oral B Pulsonic is such a nice alternative. The size is perfect. It is only just a tad larger than a regular manual toothbrush. It is great. It is very comfortable to use, the head size and shape is great and it works very well.

I never thought I would choose anything over my Sonicare, but this toothbrush by Oral B was a pleasant surprise and I do now prefer it due to it\'s slim design and comfortability.5 stars!"

3015,3098,20100824,B003UKR67M,4,"August 24, 2010",APP35M28G2U51,"An Excellent Electric Toothbrush, At A Very Reasonable Price","I\'ve been using an electric toothbrush for almost 3 years now, and would never be without one.I\'ve used Oral B products before, but never their electric toothbrushes, but I have been curious about them.So, when I was given the opportunity to try this product, I decided to go ahead and order this.  I wanted to see if a less expensive electric toothbrush, if it was comparable to the more expensive electric toothrushes, like the one I have been using for years now, and have been very satisfied with.This electric toothbrush doesn\'t have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive electric toothbrush, such as the ability to choose from more than one setting, or a UV sanitizer.I have to say tho that this electric toothbrush made my teeth feel like they were really being scrubbed, so when I was finished using it, my teeth felt very clean.  This electric toothbrush came with 2 brush heads, which seem alittle bigger than the more tapered ones Iam used to using, and this motor seemed to be alittle louder. It actually would slow down, then rev back up.  The automatic timer on this electric toothbrush is supposed to run for 2 minutes, but mine seemed to run for much longer than that, so I went with it.My other electric toothbrush runs for 3 minutes at the setting I use, so I didn\'t mind this.  You always have the option of just turning it off when you want to.I wish this electric toothbrush came with some kind of cover for the toothbrush heads, and some kind of travel case, but for the excellent price of this electric toothrush I can\'t complain.  It does come with a rechargeable stand, which I just leave my electric toothbrush always plugged in, and on the rechargeable stand.  That way it is always ready to use when I need it.I also like that in reading the information that came with this electric toothbrush, that you have like 5 different options for brush heads, depending on the kind you like.  The brush heads seem to be alittle more reasonably priced too, as I always like to buy a minimum of 3 brush heads at a time.  With this electric toothbrush you can even buy them in a quantity of 6, if you want to.  I like to have enough for a year, which they recommend you change your brush head every 3 months, which I agree, so I do that.If you\'ve always wondered if you would like using an electric toothbrush, but didn\'t want to spend the big bucks, you should try this electric toothbrush.  It works very well, at a reasonable price.The major reason to use an electric toothbrush to begin with is to really clean your teeth and gums, which this one seems to do that as well as my more expensive electric toothbrush.Having healthy teeth and gums is so important to your overall health.  Everyone should be able to afford to have an electric toothbrush. I know some of the electric toothbrushes are cost prohibitive, at over $100, but this Oral B electric toothbrush is under $30, much more doable for alot of people.I will continue to use this electric toothbrush, along with the other electric toothbrush I already have.Iam very happy that I was able to try this product, and very satisfied with the results I got."

2975,3056,20101113,B003UKR67M,2,"November 13, 2010",A13700AF4X40YG,Small Step Up from Manual Toothbrush,"I got this toothbrush thinking it might be a less expensive alternative to the more expensive sonic toothbrushes that I\'ve been using.  While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I\'m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn\'t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don\'t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I\'d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I\'ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I\'m not a dental health professional, so I don\'t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn\'t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it\'s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can\'t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I\'m afraid I don\'t care for it enough to do even that).If you\'re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I\'ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn\'t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums."

I brook down and bought the version with the SmartGuide. My thought was what the heck even though I thought I did not require it. I have say that there have been times when I would have stopped brushing before 2 minutes are up because I thought 2 minutes had gone by. Note that the toothbrush pulsates every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants and pulsates three times at the two minute mark, so you don\'t really need the SmartGuide. It is still nice to check while brushing and the clock is a nice feature as well. For Christmas I got my wife the same toothbrush, but it now seems to be called the 5000. I have to say it is hard to figure out all the models and sets Oral-B creates. I told my wife that when you first use the toothbrush you will feel as if your teeth are going to shake right out of your mouth and she agreed. After a couple of uses, you become totally use to the brush. I have read negative reviews in which people stated this toothbrush makes their gums bleed, I can only assume they have gum problems and brushing action was too much for their gums. Without a doubt my teeth are much cleaner with this brush. I am not always good about flossing, and I would notice that when I got around to flossing again after period of not flossing that my gums were sore the following day. I noticed tarter build up as well. With the Triumph/5000, I never notice these problems now. Of course this toothbrush is not a substitute for not flossing, but I feel it really helps if you don\'t always floss. Our kids have now used our toothbrushes as well for the last few months and most importantly they are brushing for a full two minutes. Prior to this my son was closer to bushing for 10 seconds than 2 minutes. I figured too that the newness of the brush would have worn off with them, but they still seem to like it. Battery life is good as well. I get about 11 days between charges, but I also brush between 2.5 minutes and 3 minutes every time I brush. With that factored in I would say a 2 minute brusher would get pretty close to 2 weeks on a charge. Bottom line is this is a great product. So much so that I hauled it with me on an 8-day trip to Europe, and it went in my backpack not my checked luggage. I still take a manual toothbrush on overnight trips, but I sure hate not having this toothbrush with me."

I examined every part of the toothbrush to see where it could have come from, and eventually rinsed out this tiny little hole towards the top of the toothbrush (which I had never noticed or thought about before) and found, to my horror, that it was absolutely filled with disgusting mold. You know those scenes in lowbrow comedies where a character finds out that they\'ve eaten something disgusting, and desperately try to clean out their mouth until they feel better? Yeah, the scene that followed was kind of like that.Maybe I missed something in the instructional booklet (and I DID read it,) but I had no idea I should be on the look-out for mold in such a random place in my toothbrush. A Google search has shown me that a lot of people have the same problem, and they fix it using things like bleach, hotel towels (\'Because it\'s too revolting to even use my own towels on it\') and an independently-created product that attempts to seal the stupid little hole.Personally, I\'m not going to use a hygiene product that can cause way more harm than good.

With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh. The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline. It\'s not a substitute for flossing, but an additional help. My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven\'t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power. If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better. I\'m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea).

The stupid timer thing is a waste of plastic and will probably end up in the trash.  It\'s useless and not a smart solution.  It waste battery and it\'s bulky.  Sonicare brushes just beeps and stops for a split second to tell you to move to the next quadrant (it\'s built into the toothbrush).  Also, this thing seems to just rotate and didn\'t do too well between the gap of your tooth.  With sonicare, it just sorta melts it was or the bubbles extract the stuff out.If you insist on this type of brush, buy the 4000 version...even if the 5000 is cheaper (which is not)...because it\'ll save having to buy batteries or waste the planet\'s resource.Again, I hate waste, stupid design, gimmicks.I want to see someone else support me on this.

Years ago my dentist recommended Sonicare and I have been a faithful user of them, upgrading when new models came along.  My dental visits have reflected that use.My hygienist prefers Oral-B and we have talked about it over the years.  I wasn\'t persuaded.  Recently Oral-B started a 50% off campaign and with their 60 day return policy I thought I would try them out.I am glad I did.  I very much like this toothbrush and how it works.  It is bigger than my Sonicare Flex, but even so it feels very good in my hand.  I love the smart timer.  While the Sonicare gives you a beep/jar every 30 seconds, you can see your progress with the Oral-B on the timer.  The Oral-B also gives you a jar too.  In fact, this is the one thing I don\'t like about it.  It is too much of a jar, especially at the 2 minute mark.  It is as if your car is about to stall.After two minutes the Sonicare shuts off.  The Oral-B keeps going until you shut it off.  I am finding that I keep on using it for another 30 to 60 seconds.  Now you can select a deep clean cycle of 3 minutes rather than the normal 2 minute cycle, but I find I prefer going through the normal cycle and then concentrating on the areas my dentist has mentioned as needing extra attention for another 30/60 seconds.The brushes seem to be fine.  I have used the ones that came with the package but also the sensitive head.  I like the sensitive head best.  It is a bit more compact and seems to get the job done.I will know how effective it is for me when I next visit the dentist for a cleaning.But for now, my feeling is that I am doing a better job in brushing and concentrating on the problem areas.I am keeping this and sending in for the rebate."

Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson & Johnson5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.This is the regiment he advised me to follow:1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it\'s the best time of day for using fluoride.3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \'glides\' right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \'grips\' the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it\'s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don\'t even think about it!5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don\'t have to wonder \'did I brush good enough\'. It tells you when you are done!CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.

So, you have to use ANOTHER one to get the first one out. Often times you end up shredding that one in the same spot and need to try again using just enough pressure to make it between the teeth, but not too much that it leaves another thread stuck there.

In the past I have only used the traditional small, round brush head. I saw these on Amazon and decided to pick them up. They clean very well, seemingly better than the smaller brush heads. They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft. Also, the \'floss action\' plastic tips around the perimeter don\'t really seem to be flossing more than they are just contributing to the roughness of the overall brushing experience. Overall, I give them 3.5/5UPDATE: After using these for a month now, I have to say that the bristles do become softer over time yet giving you a good cleaning. I give them 4 stars."

Both my fiance and myself use it and we could not be happier with it.Inside the box you will find a the toothbrush, a charger with a base you can separate for travel, a \'Floss Action\' head, a \'Pro White\' head, a travel case, and the Smart Guide (with an additional set of batteries).The charge lasts about 4 days for both of us brushing twice a day. The strength of the brushing on \'normal\' mode is certainly not gentle, but then again, that\'s what the \'sensitive\' mode is for. We always use the normal mode and we\'ve had no issues. The \'Floss Action\' heads seem to work quite well to remove some of the inter-dental debris, but flossing is still necessary.We were a little skeptical about the SmartGuide, but since buying this toothbrush was part of our plan to improve dental hygiene, we decided to give it a shot. We mounted it on the bathroom wall next to the mirror. The thing quickly detects when you start brushing and shows you a diagram and a timer, so you know how long you need to brush. The rest of the time, it\'s a handy clock! We actually really like it. It was worth spending a few extra bucks to get it.All in all, it was a great purchase and a huge step up from using a regular toothbrush. I would recommend it to anyone."

I got it about a year ago from my dentist\'s office, and absolutely love it.  The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...the savings is very significant!).I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn\'t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it\'s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren\'t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don\'t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)"

2531,2590,20101015,B003CP12I4,1,"October 15, 2010",ABGUYO15QL96G,\'Crossaction\' and \'Crossaction Pro-Health\' Look Deceptively Similar,"For almost 10 years I have used the Oral-B Crossaction Toothbrushes with medium bristles and full heads.  I have always loved these brushes because the bristles are so stiff.  They remain in almost new condition for a couple of months.  They do a wonderful job cleaning and brushing is a pleasure instead of a chore.  (I have tooth sensitivity and I love the stiff bristles--soft bristles bother my teeth.)  Today I accidentally picked up the Crossaction Pro-Health and I was certainly disappointed.  I noticed the last set of bristles was green instead of white and the head size said large instead of full, but I thought Oral-B had just done a product makeover.  To my disappointment, the Crossaction Pro-Health cannot compare to the original Crossaction.  I just bought the Pro-Health today and the bristles are softer than those of my 3 month old used original Crossaction brush.  If Pro-Health was in big letters and they didn\'t look so similar I wouldn\'t complain, but the toothbrushes look exactly alike and Pro-Health is *tiny* on the packaging, so small that I didn\'t even notice it until I got the packaging out of the trash to include the UPC in my letter to Oral-B regarding the suspected makeover.  And that is how long it took me to realize that Oral-B hadn\'t done a makeover, I just bought the wrong brush.  Ugh...  Do yourself a big favor and buy the Oral-B Crossaction Toothbrush instead of the Oral-B Crossaction Pro-Health Toothbrush.  Happy brushing Amazonians. :)UPDATE:  The Pro-Health version has replaced the original version and you can\'t get the original.  :\'("
1106,1131,20080428,B000AUIFCA,4,"April 28, 2008",A3VYKXHQDICC6,OK,"I\'ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for the last 10+ years. Usually, I buy the regular, round Flexisoft brush heads. The last time I tried to purchase them, however, the store was out of stock. But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.They work well. They deliver that nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and expect from our Oral-B\'s. In this regard, they are at least the equivalent of the Flexisofts, and they may even be slightly superior.Braun embeds 4 little rubber \'paddles\' into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss. I can not detect any \'flossing\' from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess. It may be that the \'paddles\' do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell. They cause no discomfort. The brushing feels slightly different, but not unpleasant.The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers. Rather than being circular, like the regular heads, it is an oval. The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large. I think that one of the Oral-B\'s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth. That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.When I need to replace these, I will look for the regular Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. In my opinion, those are the best. But if I can\'t find them, I would not hesitate to buy these again.***UPDATE 2/2011: It amazes me, but there appears to be a *thriving* market in counterfeit Oral-B Brush Heads! I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon. Under the price, where it says \'Sold By\' make sure that it says \'Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\' If it doesn\'t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \'More Buying Choices,\' and see if you can find one that says Amazon. Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don\'t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon."

Ok not really but it is a sweet little tooth brush. I love that it\'s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue you can put it on soft mode. The charger you see in the picture can actually come apart so you are left with a tiny stand if you want instead of the big face. The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist saying \'you\'re brushing your teeth too hard\' which can be very bad for you. Finally the cost. You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning. My mouth was a little sore but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \'I bet you haven\'t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\' I actually told him that wasn\'t true...I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing. My teeth feel the same as going to a dentist (plus I floss twice a day), every day..what more can you ask for.Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes... you get what you pay for period. People my age find this expensive, but the investment again is just a win-win that pays for itself right away. Did I mention is also really does help whiten teeth with the special head? yeah that\'s awesome also!...oh and the charge really does last all week"

If they are, someone really dropped the ball at the QC station. The brush heads become loose very quickly. Aside from pinching parts of your mouth in the loosened gap, they will eventually disintegrate in your mouth. I have just ordered the Braun labeled heads and hopefully, they are up to the excellent quality of the originals.

Why it took so long for me to buy an electric or battery powered toothbrush is beyond me. However, I\'m glad I finally woke-up and bought this \'Oral-B Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\', I\'ll never buy another manual toothbrush again.It\'s a Great Toothbrush. Buy it, you won\'t regret it.It comes as advertized with two AA batteries, just plug them in and you\'re ready to go. It has a neat 2 minute timer, which by the way is a long time when you actually start brushing. And that\'s a good thing.I got one tiny, insignificant gripe, it\'s hard to see the (+ -) battery polarity on the side of the toothbrush after removing the battery cap. When I installed the batteries the first time it wouldn\'t start, so I had to switch the batteries around, and now I have to remember the correct installation the next time I add new batteries. It\'s nothing to lose sleep over.Speaking of battery caps, removing the batter cap may be a slight problem for those people who suffer arthritis of the hand but it\'s do-able. You have to \'squeeze hard\' the two rubber spots on the sides, at the bottom of the toothbrush to release the battery cap. With that said, that too can be a good thing, because that means the battery compartment is airtight and waterproof.The ON/OFF switch is covered in some type of rubbery, waterproof membrane and is very responsive; quick on, quick off. The brush itself has a nice weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. Has the right amount of balance as well.The handle is made of two types of materials: rubber and a very smooth plastic, there\'s enough rubber on the handle so you don\'t have to worry about it slipping from your hands, even when wet. The package doesn\'t mention anything about what type of bristle comes with this toothbrush (i.e., soft or hard bristle), however, I felt NO irritation or discomfort what-so-ever.The overall length is 8-inches; brush head length is about 2.75-inches, width of the handle is about 1.5-inches X 1-inches.There are four different styles of toothbrush refill heads available for the \'Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\':1)Oral-B \'Precision\' Clean Brush Head (which comes with this toothbrush)2)Oral-B \'Pro White\' Replacement Brush Head3)Oral-B \'Dual Action\' Premium Power Toothbrush Head4)Oral B \'Floss Action\' Brush HeadI plan on stocking up on all 4 refills.

I give the Oral-B Braun lots of stars for ease of use, dependability and it gets in to those hard to reach places with the small round head. The only negative thing I have is that the new stand for it is not as sturdy as the old one and I miss that little green light telling me it is sitting correctly. All in all its a 5 star item.  Amazon also gets 5 stars for its fast and efficient service, quick shipping and great competitive prices.  Be sure to check out their great prices on name brand items.

Second, despite the fact that I\'m no longer scrubbing my teeth with all my strength (I actually use the lighter \'Sensitive\' setting with the sensitive brush heads), my teeth look and feel much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush, there\'s less noticeable plaque buildup, and I\'ve been able to maintain that just-cleaned-at-the-dentist feeling for over a month (as opposed to a few days before).

It cleaned my teeth and gums so well- the tooth brush head has little flossers in it. These really irritated my gums the first time I used it, but it felt great afterwards (ie, really clean!) and my gums have adjusted to it quickly.The timer feature also informed me I apparently have never brushed my teeth as long as the recommended 2 minutes... the 2 minutes felt like forever the first time!My one concern over this toothbrush is that the replacement heads look like they cost a significant proportion of what the brush itself costs."

But lately, I\'ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \'bristles\' and how they\'d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I\'d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I\'ll be certain to purchase this model again.  Goodbye, Reach!"

It reuses the old heads (so it lets us leverage our existing investment in heads), but is WAY better.  It seems to spin faster and more powerfully; basically, we\'re sure that it cleans better.  There\'s a visible difference.There are some neat features as well.  It beeps to let you know when you can finish brushing a quadrant of your mouth (like the Sonicare), and a bright red light goes off when you push too hard.  Brushing too hard can wear away the gums, damage that can be very difficult & expensive to repair... if it is repairable.  (Unfortunately, we have a lot of personal experience with overagressive brushing.)We\'ve also tried the Sonicare in the past, and found the Oral-B to be superior.  The Sonicare didn\'t really do a good job of cleaning our teeth.  There are some parts, esp behind the front teeth, that Sonicare doesn\'t really do a good job of reaching.  The round head of the Oral-b allows us to reach everywhere.  After switching from the Sonicare to the Vitality, my periodontist told me she saw an improvement.  I can just imagine what she\'ll say for my next quarterly cleaning!"

Despite the name change from \'Triumph\' to \'SmartSeries,\' there are no differences except for the charger-toothbrush-holding-stand, which has changed from a tall rounded design (which was a pain to assemble and disassemble) to a elongated flattened rectangle.  In fact, if you look at the handle of your SmartSeries 5000, it says, \'Triumph.\'  All of these toothbrushes are the same design, except the 9400 doesn\'t interface with the SmartSeries clock.I have noticed that the price point has stayed similar over the years, and now Oral-B is consistently including the \'SmartGuide,\' which is a little clock-like contraption that gives signals (e.g., time, time of brush, too much pressure, etc.).  This toothbrush is convenient and does a pretty good job of keeping your teeth much cleaner and whiter than manual brushing.  My dentist doesn\'t scold me as much during cleanings any more.One caveat: My husband\'s Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries) had a bearing go out within six months of normal use.  The SmartSeries clock would flash the \'red triangle\' (brushing with too much pressure) caution and the toothbrush would buzz uncomfortably throughout the brushing process.  Although the toothbrush originally cost us around $149, we couldn\'t find the original sales receipt in order to claim the warranty.  Finally, after complaining about it for a year-and-a-half, we accepted the hit to the pocketbook and replaced his malfunctioning Triumph 9900 with the SmartSeries 5000... which was surprisingly the same toothbrush despite the name change.In short:- The price at MSRP is the equivalent of 30 regular toothbrushes, but it does a very good job when it works- This toothbrush is a good buy from Amazon due to significant price decrease (major retailers are still selling it at MSRP)- The SmartSeries 5000 (with SmartSeries) is the same as the Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries)- Keep your receipt for potential warranty issues! Better to be safe than sorry, and $160 poorer due to replacement cost (like us)- 10 hours to fully charge, about 10 days of charge at 2x brushings/day- Standalone charger is convenient to detach from brush-holder for extra counter room or to take on trips"

So I spent about 40 minutes at the grocery store agonizing over my choice, and finally picked the Vitality due to its reasonable cost and the included replacement head. So far I really like it for getting my teeth clean without my feeling like I have to scrub. I notice I don\'t put near as much pressure on my teeth and gums as I used to. I still may switch to the sensitive heads, though, as my gums feel a little worn after brushing. I like the timer too.The only things I wish could be improved are the packaging (I almost cut my hand off removing the brush!) and the lack of a charger light. Otherwise I think this is a good buy and am looking forward to good report at my next dentist appointment.**UPDATE:**I did switch to the sensitive head and I like that better. My teeth still feel clean, and the brush is much gentler. I would advise the sensitive brush if you tend to use too much pressure when brushing.Also wanted to note that the instruction sheet is very thorough and gives good information on how to use the brush and how to tell if you\'re brushing too hard."

At first I didn\'t like the size (read: I wasn\'t used to it), but after brushing with it for a weeks, I realize that I like it better because I can be more precise with my brushing (like with a regular toothbrush)The charger has a small footprint, so it doesn\'t take up too much counter space. It is  also understated so it doesn\'t draw attention to itself.Cons:The attachments (brush, floss brush) can come off or loosen during brushing. If you brush in a wrist-twisting motion like me, you\'ll have to change your brushing style or the tops will keep coming off.It only comes with one brush head. This means that unless you\'re a bachelor, you\'ll need to buy additional heads. I haven\'t looked up the price to these, but that\'s definitely something to consider.There is no cover for the brush heads. This can\'t be too sanitary - especially in a bathroom (dust, hairspray, hand-washing splashes, toilet mist, etc)Final opinion:While I do think this could be a good-value alternative to the costlier sonic toothbrush models, ultimately it\'s hard to say if this unit cleans much better than a manual toothbrush. I still end up brushing my teeth like I did with a regular toothbrush  - the only difference being that this one is vibrating as I go.With questionable benefits and so many shortcomings, I cannot recomend this product."

1950,1995,20111102,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 2, 2011",AGSC327PXS3W6,Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 - High end dental care,"The last of my 3 Sonicare Advantage electric toothbrush handles died about 2 weeks ago. I got the idea to try to replace the battery but the case has no easy way of opening and my attempt resulted in a shattered case -- it went in my batteries-to-be-recycled bag. I have an Oral-B Vitality I got cheap for under $20 over a year ago because I like to have more than one electric toothbrush (big house). However, it\'s action seemed primitive to me compared to my Sonicares, so I started shopping. Costco has a current coupon on a pair of Sonicares but I decided to look online and see what I could find out and/or buy.I decided on the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 in spite of the fact that there appears to be no rebate available for it at this time. The reasons I decided on the 5000 are several. Firstly, it appears to be not difficult to replace the battery when the time comes. The replacement batteries are easily found on ebay and several of those listings (and other YouTube videos) feature  detailed instructions on how to do the replacement. You do have to use a solder iron, but I\'ve been handy with one since I was a teenager, so no big deal. I would not buy another Sonicare if I thought it might not be possible to replace the battery.Why get the best Oral-B going in spite of the price? I am a frugal guy, extremely so, but in this instance I figure it\'s time to splurge. I have only one set of teeth. The dentist does not scare me, nor the oral surgeon, but I know that the bills can come to literally thousands of dollars. If I obsess a little on my oral hygiene, so much the better! My wallet, teeth, breathe and smile will all benefit! Oh, and my general health. Oral health is a very important part of one\'s overall health.I discovered that the extra brushes I bought for my Oral-B Vitality will work fine with my 5000, cool!The Smart Guide? Well, it\'s OK, it\'s a plus, but no biggie. The biggest advantage of it is if you use more than one mode. It shows you which brushing mode you are using, and it is possible to be in a mode you didn\'t know you were in unless you glance at the Smart Guide. This happened once to me already. I hadn\'t intended to use other than the default mode, but I\'d inadvertently pressed the mode advance button.When I got the 5000, it had no charge and I set it in the charging cradle but nothing happened and I thought maybe the battery was bad. I\'d looked at the instructions on charging but hadn\'t read down to the short paragraph where it says that the battery icon on the handle\'s LCD may not appear for 10-15 minutes the first time you charge it. I still hadn\'t seen that part of the instructions when I got the idea to place the handle in the charging cradle of my Sonicare brush, thinking the Oral-B\'s might be inoperative. Just a second or two in that cradle gave the battery enough oomph to show the battery icon, I then charged it fully in the Oral-B\'s cradle and everything\'s been fine since.The Sonicares I had would pulse briefly every 30 seconds and turn off after 2 minutes. The Oral-B does the every-30-second pulsing, but keeps on going when the 2 minutes is up. I like the fact that the Oral-B keeps on going and lets me decide when I want to turn it off.I picked up mine off ebay for about $12 less than the lowest price I\'ve seen here. The price here has varied by about $10 (i.e. 10%) just over the last week. If I were in no hurry I\'d have waited for another 50% off rebate offer, however.You have to insert the brush in your mouth before turning it on so as not to spray toothpaste all over.  Likewise, you have to turn it off before removing it from your mouth. After doing that, I place it under running tap water, and while holding it under the stream of water I turn on the brush for a few seconds and let it clean itself of toothpaste, then turn off the tap leaving the brush running for a few more seconds to let it shake off most of the water so it will dry quickly.I\'ve always brushed before flossing. I always use a dental pick as well (strongly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist, it\'s the end of a round toothpick, held in a handle called the \'perio-aid 3\', given me by my dentist). A couple of days ago I started wondering if I should really brush first and did an Internet search on the subject and found out that brushing is recommended to come last because dislodging plaque from the tooth/gum-line gives your fluoride toothpaste access to the tooth surfaces, re-mineralizing those surfaces, making them more resistant to decay. So, now I\'m brushing last."

It doesn\'t last as long between charges (approximately 1/2 as long, 5 days instead of 10 days), and you\'ll need to be careful about letting it discharge once in a while because of the memory effect of NiCd batteries.It also lacks a lot of the frills of the other toothbrush. No LED light to indicating charging / charge full, and it does not pulse at 30 second intervals when brushing. It does pulse at the end of 2 minutes though.The brushing action is also different from the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush. The brushing action feels weaker, though I must admit the teeth feels just as clean afterwards. I tried the same toothbrush head on them - they appear to be interchangeable. I\'ve also tried the original toothbrush head. I can\'t judge effectiveness (they appear to all clean well) but the one that came with the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush feels more comfortable to me - better contact with the teeth.This toothbrush is significantly lighter, but otherwise the construction looks to be about the same level as the other one.I\'m giving it 4 stars despite the shortcomings because it is significantly cheaper than the other toothbrush. I think they balance each other out (I\'d rate my existing toothbrush 4 stars as well).For me at least, an electric toothbrush cleans teeth much better than manual brushing and although I\'m definitely not a dentist, I recommend them."

Also, when using the way the instructions tell you to there is always a glob of un-lathered toothpaste in your final spit out! This tells me that these electronic toothbrushes don\'t work and you are better off with regular old fashioned toothbrushes.

Another feature I like is the pulsing every 30 seconds.  It is supposed to be for those who divide their brushing between 4 sections of the mouth, upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. Since I like to do the back side of my front teeth together, instead I took the first 30 second pulse as, \'Ok, you\'re halfway through the top,\' and the second as a cue to move to the bottom.It\'s amazing, how much I had to force myself to stay on the top a full minute.  I didn\'t even realize I was brushing the lower teeth more.  I recently had a cleaning where I was told my upper back teeth had more plaque than lower. Now I know why!This will keep you even in your brushing time throughout your mouth, feel great, give you a terrific clean, yet be gentle.I was SO pleased that I got one for my hubby.  We have separate bathrooms, or could have easily shared the handle.  He didn\'t do the full two minutes on our old version, but on this one he is.

I\'ve been using it for about 3 weeks, and I\'ve noticed a vast improvement in my teeth.  You know that area behind your front bottom teeth?  You know, the area where you get tons of plaque build-up?  I HATE that spot!  I\'ve flossed religiously, and brushed like crazy to make that plaque go away, and it never really does!  Well, after three weeks of using this toothbrush, I\'ve noticed hardly any plaque in that problem-area!  My husband is so impressed that we purchased extra brushheads for him to try it out and he\'s sold as well.There are three brushing options.  1) regular 2) sensitive 3) whitening.  I tend to always brush on the third level of Whitening.  I really like the light up indicator telling you that you are pressing too hard.  Also, there is a timer that vibrates when you should move to the next quadrant of your mouth.The stand and charger are also a nice perk.  The stand comes with 4 compartments to store the brushheads, as well as the charger stand.  But if you don\'t think the extra part of the brushhead storage is needed, you can only use the charging portion to take up less space.Overall, this is a fanastic toothbrush by Oral B.

I had one in a drawer that cost under $20 that I never used because it was heavy and loud so I always thought I would stick to a manual toothbrush, much to the consternation of my dentist.  After reading a few reviews and talking to my hygenist I decided on the Oral-B 5000 and love it!  At first it seemed like way too much technology for something so basic, but after the short read through the manual and letting it charge I was ready to go and it only took a few uses to get the hang of.  The manual was very easy to read and understand and didn\'t really take that long to review.  Another reason that I decided on the Oral-B was because of the smaller head of the brush.  A friend of mine with another brand toothbrush said that she wishes that she had thought of that when she purchased hers.  It really is a great toothbrush and I do really feel that it deep cleans.  My only complaint about the toothbrush is that it is sort of loud, but on the sensitive setting it isn\'t too bad.  But if you need help waking up in the morning...maybe the noise will help!

I\'ve been using Oral-B for years. My second one was still functional, but now that I use rechargeable AA and AAA batteries, I preferred to get rid of the charging stand. It takes space, adds clutter, and occupies an outlet -- and it\'s especially inconvenient if you can\'t keep it near the sink. This version of the Oral-B was just the ticket! My favorite brush is now free and easy without need of a charging stand. This product is exactly what I expected and wanted, so I have no complaints. And the price is just a steal!Just a word about brush heads. There are various options for Oral-B, but basically two main ones: Precision Clean and Dual Clean. Precision Clean only has the round group of bristles at the tip of the brush. The correct way to use this brush head is to run it slowly over each tooth. This cleans very thoroughly. For people who aren\'t comfortable changing the technique they\'re accustomed to with non-powered toothbrushes, there is the Dual Clean. This brush head has an extra group of bristles that allows you (if you want) to use the Oral-B more like a regular non-powered toothbrush."

Then I tried this DualAction brush head, and loved it even more in about 3 seconds.  Still do.  In fact, I recently ordered 5 of the 3-packs all at once because I\'ve had trouble finding them in stores and I was afraid they would stop making them or change the design.Now, it is true that at first it feels like you\'ve put one of those power floor scrubbers in your mouth, in that it feels kinda big and industrial until you\'re used to it.  But boy does it make your teeth and gums feel cleaner.  And I was accustomed to the different feel by the end of my first brushing with it.  If that sounds potentially troubling to you, I recommend just buying a one-pack the first time.  It\'s not cheap, after all, but for me it\'s been well worth the cost.  Do try it.I should also note that when I mentioned to my dentist that I\'ve been using this, she referred to it as a \'business killer.\'  I take that as another good sign."

The sonic cleaning action is at a higher rate then my old toothbrush and probably provides better cleaning but the head seems very small in my mouth. I prefer the larger head that was on my old Ultrasonex.

It doesn\'t irritate my gum and cause the pain like other traditional toothbrushes do when pressing close to my gum to clean more thoroughly. This is my first power brush and it excels my expectation. One thing I wonder about is that if the charger will be wasted faster if I leave it plugged whole day. To avoid/slow down this process, I try to recharge it only when the brush head vibrates really slow and unplug it after an overnight recharging.

It has a clean and sensitive speed. I can\'t really tell the difference between the two but if you have sensitive teeth I am pretty sure you will. It also comes with a charging stand. It is small and holds to brush heads. It has a small profile so it wont take up a lot of counter space. It also has a mount where you can screw two nails on the wall and mount the stand on the wall. The brush does a great job of cleaning my teeth. Especially between the teeth using the precision tip. The brush heads are very easy and fast to switch. It is simple to clean.

The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage. Obviously Oral-B is trying to cut corners here by offering a newer model with inferior quality.If you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine.

I also like that it is much less bulky and feels more natural in my hand. I went into my dentist four months (and zero uses of dental floss) after starting with the Pulsonic and she said \'finally, you\'re actually using dental floss! I\'m so proud of you\'. I didn\'t want to break her heart, so I just nodded and smiled.My only problem with the refills is the stupid pick thing that you have to buy along with the three heads, and thus the three star review.

I bought the dual clean as the brush has dual heads and thus twice the brushing area.  It does an effective job for me and it is definitely better than a manual brush.

I found the best value on Amazon by BelowCostJML. They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&H for my whole shipment. (I ordered 5x the item of 6 brushes/ea, so 3 bucks S&H for 30 brush heads).Other sellers came somewhat close in pricing but wanted $7-10 S&H fees, not to mention that some would limit you to 1 item (of 3 brushes)/order. So if I wanted to increase the quantity to get the 30 brush heads I got from BelowCostJML, I would have to literally place the order 10 times and pay the ludicrous S&H cost 10x!I\'m thankful for BelowCostJML\'s fair pricing, including S&H and for their great service! The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time. Very pleased with the service!The product speaks for itself, I\'ve been a satisfied user for 8 years and I personally find it gentler in the mouth than Sonicare [I\'ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque (it\'s just a matter of each individual\'s preference)... I guess the \'difference\' would be equivalent to Pepsi versus Coke if you will (not that I\'m encouraging regular consumption of either): they give you the same overall effect, it just depends which one you prefer best. Hope this helped. Happy brushing (and don\'t forget to floss, too). :-)"

The difference can be compared to a Pinto vs. a Lexus.  The Sonic Spin Brush worked okay, and probably if I had never owned a real Sonic Toothbrush, I would have kept it, but it was not the same.

I also bought another Oral-B Professional Care model for myself but without the clock or toothbrush holder as I didn\'t have the room on the shelf where I keep the electric toothbrush in another bathroom, and am just as pleased with it.  However, had I bought the same model, I read in the directions that there was a step necessary so one unit would not interfere with the other if they were too close to each other.

I find myself wrapping my thumb around the handle to hold it while brushing and, sometimes inadvertently, hitting the Mode button. So, I\'ll be brushing in one mode and then the brush will switch to a different mode -- this makes me have to hit the Mode button 3-4 times to cycle back through to the mode I want to use. Again, this is my fault, but I also blame it on the design of the brush.2) I find the brush head bristles to be way too hard/harsh. I have these brush heads: Floss Action, Precision Clean and Pro White. I am going to buy the so-called Sensitive brush head and give it a try.

Kind of like the old vibrating toothbrushes from long ago, except the power behind this is far greater, and much more effective.Sonicare had the benefit of being first with this type of brush, but Oral-B has an advantage in that they can study the other product and make improvements on it.  I\'d say the major difference is that the Oral-B is thinner, lighter, and therefore easier to hold and maneuver around the mouth.  The replacement brushes are also less expensive on this model, which is important as they can really add up if you replace them as recommended by the manufacturer, every three months or so.I was pleased to see that toothpaste can be used with it, although if you use too much you\'ll be foaming at the mouth from the ultrasonics.  It is still pretty foamy, so I recommend staying close to the sink.The recharging base is small, attractive, and wall-mountable.  The power cord plugs into a wall outlet and doesn\'t use a transformer, so it won\'t take up additional outlets. It will hold two spare brush heads behind the toothbrush, and allows the toothbrush to be dropped in facing any direction.  So, when you are done it is an easy matter to drop the toothbrush back onto its base.It actually worked quite a bit better than I expected.  The head is fairly small, so it is easy to move around your mouth to clean each tooth.  The timer lets you know if you are rushing the job (I usually am, but at least now I can\'t pretend I don\'t know that!).  The massage mode for the brush seems like a feature that I\'ll never use, but people with tender gums that are working their way up to the full speed might like it.  I use mine on clean mode all the time and it works well.  It is somewhat annoying that both modes are accessible through the single button given that I never use the lower-speed.  It isn\'t so annoying that it is a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.I was happy with the noise level, too.  Nothing bugs me more than holding something that sounds like a buzz saw so close to my ear in the morning.  Mercifully, this brush is pretty quiet, as these things go.  It is louder than a manual brush, of course, but quieter than an electric shaver.  The pitch is a little high, but nothing I can\'t live with.Overall, I like it and would get it again.

By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations. Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.Looks and size: nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).I would recommend this product to my family and friends."

If the effects of the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) stopped there, I would be merely satisfied, but as you may pick up from my tone and use of exclamation points, I am ecstatic! I used to go on dates with the confidence of a nerdy insecure loser; picture Woody Allen, but with bigger glasses. Now I have the confidence to take on anything! It\'s like I\'m Rambo but not a psychopath and with the cleanest teeth EVER. But wait, there\'s more. The other day I was driving down the street and I got pulled over by a cop for speeding. He got out of his car, came up to my window, and asked me for my license and registration. As I gave it to him, I looked up and flashed him one of those Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) clean smiles. It just so happened that he was a user too.

I don\'t floss, I rarely use mouthwash, and I brush once a day. I figure my teeth can make do. Well after trying this toothbrush my teeth actually feel a bit cleaner than usual. The cost is there though for the initial toothbrush system and I\'m sure replacement heads are equally as expensive so it may not be worth it if you brush often.You do leave with a somewhat polished feeling so it\'s worth a try at least if you\'ve never used a power brusher. It really depends on how much money you want to invest in your teeth. If you\'re like me you\'ll like it but it\'s probably not worth it in the long run."

It\'s lasted an amazingly long time; the battery has just recently started having trouble keeping a charge. (Mechanically, it still works perfectly.) So, I decided to try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush.Compared to the Sonicare, the Oral-b is quite different. It\'s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \'sonic\' movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts. The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \'floss action\' rubber points work quite differently as well. At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth. Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice. I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.(One small issue wroth noting: all the included tooth brush heads look the same. It\'s awkward to share between two people because the different heads look identical. It would be nice to have different colored heads, like Philips provides.)"

2325,2379,20101023,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 23, 2010",ARX9BYBD4DS4,An electric experience,"Once upon a time at a sink far far away I brushed my teeth with teeny tiny sonic waves.  Then one day the evil nemesis time took it all away as my Sonic powered toothbrush ceased pulsing its distinctive sound of a million mad mosquitoes.  My wife, as she is wont to do,never wanting anything to do with my inter-spatial toothbrush saw this as the opportunity to finally throw it in the trash. For days it lay in state at the bottom of the can. It was a vision of pure sadness as I knew that now, once again, my elbow must flex and my hand once again must clench the minuscule handle of (gulp)...a manual toothbrush. The thought of losing another energized brush kept me away so for years I maintained only memories of the mad mosquitoes that once blasted calculus to the oblivion. If I had only had that Sonic brush in Mr. Farkner\'s math class, I often thought, perhaps I would have passed. I spoke often to my wife about finding another sonic calculus blaster but this brought only glares. For, as I have previously stated, my wife hated every tiny sonic wave of it\'s tiny brush and nearly forbid it.As I sat in the body conforming chair of my dental hygiene adviser, mirror in hand, viewing my pearly off-whites the bad news came; word by grating word; \'You\'re a lousy brusher\'. These words came from a mouth I could not even see.  Was it true? Is this why she protected her mouth from mine with that veil? For the second time in my life I learned calculus is no fun as she told me I must return for two whole hours of scraping. And it was all my fault. \'This\' she proclaimed after quickly unveiling her mouth \'is an Oral-B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush. and it alone is the answer to your inadequacy\' Wow, it was a mouthful and I was not even sure I could utter that many words without removing the cotton from my cheeks but I still tried. \'A mmmpphh, mmmphh\'. I gave up protesting further only in my mind. \'But it has no sonic drive!\' I though. Seeming to read my thoughts she smiled and curled my fingers around the handle. \'It has modes, lots of modes, and the brush is big, big enough to massage your gums, and who doesn\'t like a gum massage...right?\' I pondered her words as she veiled her mouth again and scraped her way slowly through my calculus problems.As I left her presence, and all the way home on the bus, her words rang in my head. At the first opportunity I searched the World Wide Web for the best price and found a quick trip to the Amazon was in order. I pushed the right buttons and soon it arrived, wrapped incognito in it\'s brown cardboard box with that winky smile. Inside, nestled against it\'s plastic air pillow my new toothbrush rested from it\'s long journey. The air was electric as I pulled it from it\'s packaging and plugged it in. I hung it\'s cordless timer on the wall. I could hardly wait to massage my gums but the book clearly stated I must so I did. When morning came I grabbed the handle. No more clenched fist around a minuscule handle, this baby was large, form fitted to my hand and pulsed with excitement. I pushed the button . The brush came to life. Gone was the sound of a million angry mosquitoes on a mission of blood replaced instead with a sound of raw rotating power. The sound was humanly audible and no longer called dogs from every outside quadrant. At first my elbow still flexed back and forth, as though I were to do the work, but I soon learned I need only relax, position the brush over each tooth and let the Oral-B work. The timer on the wall counted up the seconds. Thirty seconds later the brushed pulsed on and off and I was off to attack a new quadrant.  In just two minutes I was done. The brush had solved my calculus problems for the day and the timer even smiled its approval. Awesome!"

I like it a lot as I feel my teeth are cleaner and fresher when I am done.  I like the dual action brush as it cleans a larger tooth surface and massages your gums.  This toothbrush removes more plaque than a regular toothbrush and does a better job of polishing your teeth.  My dentist recommends Oral B and so I tried one and use it daily.I have changed the brushing head many times and the base even uses the rotating single action head if you can\'t find the dual action one.  The toothbrush has charged for over 3 years with the inductive charging stand and the batteries are still good.  I am happy with the quality of the product and the way it cleans my teeth.  I recommend it to you as a good product.

The outer bristles are raised about two millimeters above the middle ones- meaning that you have to gnash them into your gums just to make contact between the middle bristles and your teeth. Then there\'s the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush. It\'s like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face. There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience."

It took nearly 24 hours before the green charge lights quit blinking. They stop when the charge is complete. I\'m very happy with how clean my teeth seem after my first brushing session. The sealed box came with one FlossAction brush head.The handle I received says, \'TRIUMPH Professional Care\' and has the green charge lights on a gray background. It is NOT the digital display. My first guess is that this is the older model but some reviewers said they called Oral-B and were told the handles with a non-digital display (like mine) are the newest model, so I\'m not sure. I\'m also not sure if there are any improvements with a newer model - other than the display - that would make me want to be sure and have the newer model? I noticed that Amazon sales of the 4000 model are temporarily on hold while they investigate what appears to be the same issue.For now, I am happy and content with what I have. If anyone knows or learns more about this issue please let us know! The toothbrush seems excellent!Update: After reading through the model 5000 reviews going back to 2009, I now think that mine is a newer model afterall. Originally, they came with a 110/220 volt power adapter with the electronics built into the AC plug which made the plug that goes into the AC outlet overly large (some reviewers complained about the large plug). Mine has just a small basic 2-prong AC plug. Mine is 110 volt only and the electronics are in the charging base where the brush handle sits. Older units came with 2 or 3 brush heads. Mine came with only 1. So, it appears that Oral-B decided to cut some costs by removing the dual voltage and 1 or 2 extra brush heads. They also decided to change the LCD handle display to LED. Hopefully, they also added some improvements?! I\'m still happy."

I have mostly used manual toothbrushes probably for most of my 45 years.  I had purchased a Crest Spinbrush (probably a few years ago), and finally  started using it in the last year.  It cleaned my teeth well enough and didn\'t bother me.  This Oral-B Pulsonic is very sleek and appears to be well made.  Unfortunately, even on the sensitive setting, it hurt on impact, and I\'m not talking a little, I mean alot.  Thinking I was jumping the gun, I lightened up on it and went around the entire mouth.  A third, slower setting may have worked, but as is, I simply cannot use it."

I brush and floss at least once a day, maybe two if I have time.  Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.Then this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information - you find out that the brush tells you how to time your brushing.  It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  Yes, and further, the brush signals you to change.Quick reminder, after you put the toothpaste on your brush, press it to your teeth before turning it on, otherwise you get to spend some time cleaning toothpaste off the bathroom mirror, walls, and perhaps ceiling.  One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over the entire area - front, bottom, back, and gumline.  After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.  I was impressed.After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  I rinsed, and looked in the mirror.  To my surprise, I could already see a change in my teeth.  It was slight, but noticeable to me.  After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost."

I used the Sonicare for years and found it extremely difficult to keep the brush head clean despite following all the various tips you can easily find with a quick google search.  The brush would consistently grow mold over time regardless of how careful I was.  While the Sonicare still has more bells and whistles overall (this could be due to model difference), I\'m willing to sacrifice those little things for what I think is probably one of the two criteria that actually matter: 1) how well the brush cleans and 2) how clean the brush stays.  By the way, the Oral B cleans teeth on par with Sonicare, in my own opinion."

While the packaging looks OEM, the quality of these heads is vastly inferior to ones purchased off the shelf at Target/CVS/etc.  The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  I\'ve used Oral-B electric brushes for over 10 years, and these heads behaved very differently.  After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!) during operation.  Also, I noticed that the \'blue indicator bristles\' never changed color at all after 8-12 weeks of use.  I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  I have noted other reviews echo these same problems.My opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...I am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product."

It\'s very poor performance.  I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger and last very long time (now they no longer make this model).  One difference I could find is that the good one was made in Germany and poor one was made in China.

This not only monitors how long you are cleaning, but, has a little red light that is illuminated when you are brushing too hard. What\'s more, once you have reached the two minute mark, a smiley face appears on the digital timer. So helpful! I look forward to following up with my dentist in six months, to track my progress.

My old one was getting long in the tooth(sorry about pun!) and running real slow, so I investigated buying a new one.  Since they were on a 50% rebate sale, i just bought the top of the line 5000 unit.  I could not be more pleased with how clean my teeth end up - I have never had a brush that cleans as well as this one; my hygienist will be so pleased!I would like to expound on the advantages of this unit over the 4000 or 3000 in cleaning ability, but I have no idea, not having used the others.  If the only difference is gimmicks, then this unit is certainly full of them, and you might be just as pleased with a cheaper unit without the unnecessary gimmicks and modes.One big con: there is a mode button to toggle through the 5 different modes that are built into this unit.  Most people, like me, will probably only use one mode, or at least will predominately use one mode.  The mode button is VERY poorly placed, in a very key position.  It is impossible to use this unit without accidentally hitting the mode key on a regular basis, if not every day.  Very annoying to have to figure out how to get back to your preferred mode.  They could not have chosen a poorer location for this if that was the goal.  Its like accidentally hitting the caps lock key on a laptop, for those who do not look at the screen while we type. What were they thinking, if they were thinking at all?  I like good design.  All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an \'F\' for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO. It was just too big a mistake to be an oversight. A smaller con - the outlet plug is a huge unit that sticks straight out from the wall - takes up space and looks stupid - should have been flush.Yet overall, I gave this 4 stars for the great cleaning and the rest of the design and charger."

In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.This Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more toothpaste.What I do like:>>  The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all.  Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  Trust me on this.>>  The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.>>  I love the rubber grip handle.  My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.>>  Will go over a week between charges.  I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging.>>  Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.What I do NOT like:>>  No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.>>  The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I\'ve ever encountered.

Small handle. It\'s not much bigger around than a regular toothbrush, especially when compared to the monster I\'ve been using. The charger is compact, too, and doesn\'t take up much room on my counter.3. Compact head. Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.4. Soft bristles.5. Vibrates rather than spinning.

Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth. I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore. I don\'t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.7. Stops briefly to let you know when it\'s time to switch \'quadrants.\' (You\'re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.) When the maximum 2 minutes has elapsed, the brush gives a double signal.8. There is a precision attachment to get between teeth and into dental work.9. Does a fantastic job.

The first time I have tried it, it felt a bit unpleasant, but I have gotten used to it very quickly. The best thing about this brush is the bigger brush head as compared to Oral-B Triumph. The brush allows you to use twice as much toothpaste (I have always been concerned that I was not using enough toothpaste with round Oral-B brushes), and it seems that it cleans teeth faster on flat surfaces. Getting into corners requires as much effort as with any other toothbrush.What I did not like: the charger is big and you cannot remove extra brush holders; to turn it off you have to push the power button twice (the first time it switches to sensitive mode); you are supposed to use it in a circular motion, and I tend not to be very good at it. In old days I had problems with traditional toothbrushes as I used to move them up and down and ended up scratching my teeth, so I am afraid this might happen with this brush as well. Finally, the description promises whiter teeth in two weeks, but I cannot see any difference."

At the time I was 3 months pregnant - as any dentist will tell you, your oral health tends to decline during pregnancy, due to various reasons.  Already I had a lot of tartar buildup and some places to watch.  Well, immediately after my check up I started using the Sonic Complete.  I love that it times the brushing for you, 30 seconds per quadrant, so you do a thorough job.  Last week I went back to the dentist for my 6-month followup, now 9 months pregnant, and anticipating the worst - but it was the best check up I\'ve ever had.  The cleaning was a breeze - I had hardly any buildup and everything looked great.  The hygienist couldn\'t believe it, especially given my pregnancy, and agreed with me that it must be the toothbrush.  So I\'m hooked!

2611,2674,20100827,B003UKKH6O,3,"August 27, 2010",AOVROBZ8BNTP7,Low Cost For a Reason,"Overall, the Vitality is a nice toothbrush. If one trusts the packaging, it out performs a manual toothbrush.  If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It\'s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one\'s teeth during brushing.I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one\'s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.So, it\'s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs."

This hole spits out your toothpaste/saliva mix anytime that you happen to maneuver the brush so that this part come out through your lips.  The result is a flow of toothpaste and saliva all over your brand new shirts - this sucks unless you like paying for unnecessary dry cleaning.  The alternative is to lean over the sink so that gravity will pull this flow down into the sink, not down on to yourself.  This is rather uncomfortable after about 2-3 minutes of standing in this awkward position.  The projectile saliva/toothpaste mix is an inevitability with this design - it sucks!

I\'ve always had severe gum problems and have had many gum grafts.  Until it dawned on me that I\'m still having gum problems so I switched to a new Periodontist who informed me that the Sonicare was tearing up all my gum grafts that were done.  He highly recommended the Oral B.  So I switched and what a huge difference.  It goes around the tooth which is what their instruments do at the dentist.  After using it for a almost 3 months, I can see a huge difference!  My gums and teeth feel clean but not all tore up.  I can\'t wait to go back to the Periodontist and show him the difference in my whole mouth.  The ORal B 5000 has a little digital clock that shows you when you\'re brushing too hard which has made a big difference in the way I brush and a 30 second timer to show you when to switch quadrants.  I\'ve always thought that really scrubbing my teeth was the way to go but not so! This brush shows you how to do it right.

2633,2697,20120328,B003UKKHB4,4,"March 28, 2012",AT1A4VABGBB2H,Oral-B and Periodontal Disease!,"Hello All,I figured I would finally rate the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush now. I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this product.First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910. This electric toothbrush was great. I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare. My only gripe was the replacements are a bit on the pricy side. Moving on, I decided to replace the Sonicare (gave to my wife) with the Oral-B 3000. My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line. Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.As an owner of both, I find them similar in a sense, that they are both out (the toothbrushes of course) to perform the same job. The Sonicare did its job just fine. However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch. Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it\'s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.Onto the Oral-B. This brush has performed great. The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease) so I don\'t bleed as much. The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare and I really see no difference other than the size of the head. Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean). I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip. Although, it\'s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work. Plus, I always rinse the brush afterwards with hot water.The battery life appears to be great. I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days. The vibration and strength is great the company claims (40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute). The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \'off\'.The toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation. The build quality seems good to me. I have dropped this toothbrush three times over the span of three months and the electric toothbrush survived without any visual damage or cracks.The charging does take quite some time until it is fully charged. However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night. Therefore, the brush has hours of charging before its next use. One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG. This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first. Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit. Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don\'t even really notice it.In closing, I like this toothbrush. I gave it four stars because while I think it\'s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let\'s face it, it\'s a toothbrush right? Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road). Both the Oral-B and the Sonicare, have their difference. But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease. I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I do.And remember, I do NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can\'t go wrong either way."

Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use. Why the three stars and not just one? It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip brush.I have both a Oral-B Triumph and a Sonicare (can\'t remember the model number), and find both to be excellent performers. They are different, and each has its strengths/weaknesses, so I alternate between the two. The one shortcoming neither address well is getting between teeth to get out tea and coffee stains (and the occasional cigarette). For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside. My 6-month dental cleaning/checkup gets rid of them, but by month 4 or 5, they\'re back.Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it\'s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains. The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great. After brushing with either the Triumph or Sonicare, I finish with a 30-60 second run using the Precision Tip. Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth using.For everything else, the Pulsonic is a so-so performer at best. Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I\'ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.If you\'re looking to stop or get rid of in-between teeth stains, get this model and use it in combination with another model. If in-between teeth stains are not an issue, don\'t even bother with this. Pick up a different Oral-B or a Sonicare -- you\'ll be a lot happier with it than the Pulsonic."

It\'s twice-daily battle, with everyone ending up disgruntled in the end. While this toothbrush won\'t necessarily change the aggravation factor for kids, it WILL make sure that the visit to the dentist doesn\'t up YOUR disgruntlement.We got this toothbrush for our 9-year-old, who not only hates to brush his teeth, but has more than his fair share of issues with said teeth. Put simply, his orthodontist bills will be horrendous. And while he still hates to brush his teeth, I can feel confident that the dental bills won\'t outstrip the orthodontist. The two-minute timer is especially helpful for everyone, as Son knows when he\'s done and I can listen for the toothbrush to signal rather than digging up yet another destroyed kitchen timer. The action on the toothbrush head is much better than what he can do himself, though I have no idea whether it actually removes any staining (he\'s a little young for coffee and red wine issues).The price is very reasonable (particularly considering the cost of some other rechargeable toothbrushes) and the cost for the head replacements is not bad either.

I was truly sad when the poor ol\' guy bit the dust. After a week without an electric toothbrush I realized I needed to get another and researched Sonicare vs. OralB/Braun. I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn\'t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 & 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I\'m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn\'t expecting that big of a difference.The only thing I don\'t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn\'t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn\'t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.

The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth.  The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design.  It was worth trying and I\'m not disappointed but will probably be going back to the easier to maneuver regular version next time.

I would turn it off.....and set it on the recharging base....then after about 2 minutes it would turn on by itself.  Really bizarre.  Worst craftsmenship ive seen in any toothbrush.  The brush would no longer turn off when coming in contact with the charging base.  So finally after an hour of letting it run i finally just took it apart....and all the wiring inside was corroded.

She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself.

Wish I had read more reviews before buying two! This happened to me and my husband when he tried his...it is really easy to twist ever so slightly while brushing which pops head off. It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on. Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth. Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode. Returning two of these and will probably go back to Sonicare for next purchase."

I asked several dentists if they had any preferences. One thing I was told by two dentists is that electric toothbrushes are bad, because people tend to brush too hard when using them, ruining the protective enamel on their teeth.Well, I like to judge things for myself, so I did get one, an Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush. And I like it. I\'m careful not to press down too hard when I use it, and I don\'t believe it\'s harming my teeth. I\'m not as confident about that with the Pulsonic. I also prefer the battery-operated Advance over something that takes up more space around the sink and takes up an outlet. I get compliments for how white my teeth are, and I think the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is partly responsible.The Pulsonic is probably a better toothbrush, but considering the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is just $14.99 and does the job for me, I can\'t say it\'s worth the difference."

The winner for me is Oral B Essentials. Very smooth - perfectly thin. Gets between the teeth with no trouble at all. Quick to do the whole mouth. Never cuts my gums. The floss can shred a little bit, but no worse than any other I\'ve tried, I won\'t bother deducting points for that. Besides all that, it ends up being cheaper than any of the other flosses I was buying - and has just many feet or meters of floss within. What\'s not to like? I hope they make it forever."

I know most people don\'t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn\'t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!Ok now for the research details:1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it\'s time to brush on another side.6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you9. It\'s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn\'t like to brush or doesn\'t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. It guides you so you know you are getting a great cleaning. Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it! So as you can tell I love it and I am very satisfied with my purchase! Good luck and hope it works amazing for you as it does for me and my family!"

Also, I like that it warns you if you are pushing too hard.  I got it, in part, because my dentist said I was brushing too hard.  You just barely hold on to this and let it do all of the work.  It also warns you if you are pressing too hard.3. It comes with a very handy travel case, so you could travel with it and two different heads.4. The charger base and extra head organizer if a nice touch.Cons:1. I wish it would remember the last mode you use and start in that mode.  I use the gentle mode most often, and I wish I didn\'t have to hit the mode button each time I start it to get to that mode.  That being said, it\'s very simple to do and a habit not.

The kit includes two ProWhite brush heads designed to remove surface stains and polish teeth bright white.  There are three types of brushing fibers in the ProWhite rotating brush, blue, white, and green, each with a different stiffness.  The longest and least stiff blue fibers gradually loose color with use indicating the remaining life of the brush (listed as 3 months).  There is a deep cleaning orange rubber center in the brush for deep cleaning of stains.  I have noticed a clean difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums after a week of using the ProWhite.The handle of the device fits the hand nicely because of its large diameter and a ribbed blue rubber grip covering the back of the smooth light blue plastic cylinder. The cylinder has a battery that is recharged by placing it upright on a plastic stand. The unit fits on the stand with a plastic receiver on a plastic plug, so electric shock to the user is avoided. The entire hand device can be rinsed completely (not the recharging stand).There is a built in timer on the Vitality that alerts the brusher when the recommended brush time of two minutes have elapsed with a noticeable pulsing action of the brushes and the accompanying change in sound from continuous to intermittent. After the timing alert, the device resumes continuous brushing.I highly recommend this rechargeable toothbrush.  I have switched from a regular brush to the exclusive use of the Vitality. I will order the four other brush heads each with a unique cleaning function. A $3.00 coupon for these heads is included in the kit.

Amazon claims that \'The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\'  But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush. The toothbrush does work, however. I have two identical Oral-B 3D excel toothbrushes purchased on 8/20/01.  To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  I run the battery down to zero on the one I\'m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it\'s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle itself.Some reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that\'s hard to imagine:  there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  It\'s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it. It\'s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better."

It has a long-lasting rechargeable battery, which charges whenever not in use, and does a great job on teeth with a head that is shaped for hard-to-reach areas.  But the best part of this brush is the little timer that has some kind of remote signal.  It is a clock when not in use (and gives the correct time) then becomes a timer when you start to brush.  I can walk out of the room, even, and it continues to time me.  Dentists recommend brushing at least two minutes - and you get a little smiley face when you hit two minutes, or a big smiley face (sometimes a wink) if you brush for 2:30.  My kids want one ot these now, too, but I\'d say it\'s a bit too powerful for kids.  It\'s a great buy and, while it costs way more than a standard toothbrush, it holds up beautifully and works hard.  It also comes with a carrying case for travel, which I love because power toothbrushes never fit into standard cases.  The battery charge lasts two days off the charger, so you can go away for the weekend without carrying all the gear. Love it."

You will have to stand over the sink while using these, but that is not an issue for me.  If it is a problem for you, I\'d definitely recommend the FlossAction over the ProWhite.  The Dual Clean heads don\'t fit in the traveling case, so I still purchase the FlossAction for traveling and when my mouth was swollen and sore after getting some wisdom teeth pulled.

I ordered the retail version (should have gotten the Frustration Free which came with extra brush heads!).It comes with this extra guide that counts to 2 minutes (which is the optimal brushing time) and flashes a smiley face after you\'re done. I don\'t really use it, since the brush reminds me of the time every 30 seconds by stuttering for a couple seconds. After 2 minutes it stutters a little more to let you know that you\'ve been brushing for 2 minutes.The other triangular button on the brush lets you switch between modes: normal, sensitive teeth, and whitening? I\'ve only used normal, but the different modes would be great for people who may have sensitive teeth!I LOVE this toothbrush. My teeth are noticeably whiter and definitely less tartar-y.BUY IT! Highly recommended! Amazon shipped my product super fast too, props to them! Got an extra 50% off rebate from Oral-B as well.

I\'ve had a Sonicare for years and I thought nothing could compare. I was wrong -- this one works great. I received the head that has floss action and I\'m planning to try a couple of the others. That\'s one big advantage of the Oral B -- you can buy different heads to use for different purposes. The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.My only complaint is that there\'s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it\'s fully charged or when the charge is low. It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors. When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working. Now I\'m never sure when to recharge -- although it seems like you can go a long time (a week or so?) between charges."

We really, really  like the smaller brush head which seems to  be able to clean teeth in  places that a longer, straight brush does not.  Our  older  straight brush seemed to coast  along the front while this brush gets into crevices.  Neither of us is sure that we\'ve ever had a problem because of brushing too hard.  Nonetheless, the warning light for that is a nice safety factor.  High on our  list of positives are the brush head indicator  bristles that let us  know when to change the brush head.  That\'s one thing that we\'ve been unsure of and procrastinated about in the past.  Sorry to say that our teeth don\'t appear to be any whiter so we continue to use the Crest strips."

When I first used it, I could almost feel it break up any buildup on my teeth.  It truly felt like I just had my regular cleaning at the dentist.Besides the fact that the brush actually delivers on the results, the design is very well thought out.  The handle is slim and light and as easy to hold as a regular toothbrush.  The head vibration is well isolated from the handle and does not cause any discomfort.  The whole brush is completely water proof and can be washed easily.  There are no visible contacts for charging.  It just sits in the base and charges (I assume by induction) perfectly fine.It has a couple of settings for brushing or massaging and although I prefer the brushing setting for regular brushing, the massaging setting felt nice on my gums.  It has a reminder in the form of a brief pause every thirty seconds to facilitate proper brush timing.The brush comes with an additional smaller head that is meant to clean between the teeth.  It also does an excellent job at breaking up any particles and cleaning the space between the teeth and along the gum line.This is a very well built and thought out brush and I highly recommend it."

NOTE: the annoying part about the smartguide is taking off that darn battery cover! other reviewers weren\'t exaggerating about that at all! the clock on mine is still an hr behind since i couldn\'t remove that stupid battery cover to adjust the time.i\'ve only used two brush heads so far, whitening and floss-action. i\'m not sure if the whitening head really whitens like a whitening strip, but at least mine aren\'t staining even without using whitening toothpaste. the floss-action one doesn\'t really \'floss\' well. when you start off, it might be a good idea to use the sensitive or whitening head since the bristles are softer and more gentle on your gums until you\'re used to the \'power\' of an electric toothbrush.overall, i do love the toothbrush and even bought a couple additional ones for my family as gifts. so, i definitely recommend it."

In fact, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.  For regular toothbrush users, the difference is huge.  I could never go back to a regular brush.However, I have a huge gripe with people who post products for a ridiculously cheap price only to essentially double the cost with shipping.  In this case, $16 for the heads and $11 to ship them.  I can\'t imagine from their weight, that they cost anymore than $2-$3 to ship, so how someone justifies the extra $9 is beyond me.Bottom line is that this is a fantastic product that I have been extremely happy with, but the seller\'s price is (in my opinion) misleading at best and probably could be more accurately described as downright dishonest."

It feels like you just left the dwentist after a very thorough cleaning each time you use it.If I could offer one suggestion it sould be that they should inform the purchaser in a much more prominant way that when you plug the charger in and put the unit in the base there is no indication it\'s getting any charge. I was about to return the unit thinking it was defective when, to my amazement, the charging indication finally came on AFTER the unit had been in the charging cradle for about 10 minutes. I would imagine that many folks will plug it in, put the unit in the charger, see no indication of charging and promptly return the unit as \'defective.\' it\'s not. That\'s how long it takes when you charge it for the first time to \'connect\' with the charger.

Bristles packed tightly and of the correct color, serial number intact, 2 color rings included with each brush and packaging checked out with what the genuine manufacturer produces.I know amazon can have multiple vendors for one listing and the subheading should disclose the info at time of order.

I\'m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that \'just came from the dentist\' clean feeling.I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in \'timer\' that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  I don\'t think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you\'re done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush, I purchased five heads for the price of 3 of the brand-name ones.The only feature I don\'t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you\'re using too much pressure when you brush.  I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on, I can\'t imagine most people normally brush that hard.  So for me this was not a necessary option, it\'s just there though and doesn\'t interfere with the use of the brush in any way.I only wish I had discovered the ease and pleasure of having such clean teeth earlier - I definitely recommend this brush!"

The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.

It\'s not that I didn\'t brush after every meal when I was doing it manually; it\'s that these toothbrushes do a significantly better job. Furthermore, although their use has never actually whitened my teeth, it slows down the degree of stain accumulation from tea, coffee, etc., so that I do not have to bleach my teeth as often.Having said all that: This model does not work any better than my trusty Oral-B S-200. It also has the same drawback, that the rechargeable batteries do not last forever and when they give out, you must buy a whole new unit. When in use, the toothbrush sounds louder than the S-200 and different, resembling a dentist\'s drill.  For anyone thinking of using older heads they have around, my S-200 heads do not fit on this model--the shaft is different. The brushes themselves are round instead of the traditional oval--I can\'t see any advantage to that but perhaps a dentist can.Is this toothbrush worth using?  Absolutely.

It was a loud and eventually became sloppy in holding the spindle from turning around requiring the handle to constantly be rotated. It still was very effective and still holds it\'s charge without fail.Long story short, I did research and ended up choosing the professional care 5000 over the 4000 as a replacement.  The sticker shock held off the purchase until I found a 50% rebate and free priority prime shipping.  I really prefer the \'polishing\' heads and bought 6 extra.  Net cost was about $55 which is about + price of the additional brush heads.There is no comparison between this and our old model.  It is quiet and has some cool features.  There is a visible battery (fuel) gage on the handle, and a transmitter to communicate with a seperate remote unit.  This thing times you, is a clock, and even blinks if you brush too hard. The travel case is well constructed and useful. Buy one...rebate took about 2 weeks...mine was a $55 check.PROS:  quiet- cool features- teeth feel like you just had a cleaning...squeek and all- noticed definate whitening almost immediately- find myself brushing more often by choice, angled position allows makes getting to back teeth a non-issue. We love it and highly recommend it.Check out the polishing heads which have a yellow rubber center. It saves the outer bristles and you still get more than adequate flossing and unbelievable plaque removal. It really extends head life especially if you brush hard, like my wife. Trust me on this; I smoke cigars.NEGATIVES:  Really none..somewhat pricey heads, but more gental than even soft hand brushes."

I have been a Sonicare user for close to 10 years and recently bought another Oral B prouduct that has a rotating brush.  The product was good but I missed the Sonic action I have been use to.  The toothbrush is a great value over 50% less than Sonicare products and seems to work exactly the same.  Oral B and Sonicare has a 2 minute timer but Sonicare turns off the device while Oral B as a pulsating \'notice.\'  I have not purchased replacement heads but so far I have been very happy.Additionally I travel a lot and the toothbrush easily keeps a charge for at least a week and is compact.  I never travel with the charging attachement.

My dentist says that most mechanical brushes aren\'t any better than manual ones, except in the case of circular ones like these.  They don\'t last as long as I\'d like them to, maybe 3-6 months if you use them very frequently.I\'d rate these a good purchase.  The replacements brushes work for several different models of toothbrush.  They even work on my older model toothbrush that is so old it isn\'t even listed on Oral-B\'s website any longer.  At least it\'s good to know they don\'t phase the old brushes out and make you buy whole new toothbrush every couple of years.  There are some alternative specialized brushes you can buy, but I like these general ones best."

I was destroying regular brushes and not doing a great job.  A friend suggested the Oral-B and when Amazon had it on sale with the 50% rebate I jumped on it.  To be Honest, this is the best toothbrush I\'ve ever owned.  I have been using the floss head with the braces and my lord does it do a great job! My teeth feel like I just got out of the dentists office, and it gets anything out of my teeth that get stuck due to the braces.  Another huge plus is that its able to get in everywhere with hardly any pressure which is great because I had concerns about bleeding, plaque buildup + getting white streaks on my teeth.  Overall the Oral-B is easy to use, the silly little smiley face lets you know when the 2 minutes are up as well as the brush heads pulsing. I rinse off the unit and remove/rinse the head and keep it in the holder and everything stays nice and neat.  This is one of those gadgets that your unsure of buying, but once you take the plunge you\'re very happy with your purchase because it just works great and is super easy to use."

I started with the \'cheap\' models that you can find at any pharmacy or grocery store and was rather pleased with their performance. My last model was sold as a two pack from a membership-based big box store. Those lasted my family about 2 years before the batteries started to loose their ability to hold a charge. I purchased this when it was a featured \'gold box deal\' and do not regret it one bit. Although it comes with a higher price, the performance is remarkable. I fell as if I am leaving the dentist office after each time I brush my teeth. The timer is more of a novalty than anything, but I do like the visual feed back to know when I\'m applying too much pressure while brushing, etc. Having a clock in the bathroom is also a nice bonus. I would recommend this without any reservations. Paired with the floss-action brush head has been the best expierence for me."

It works for me and I have noticed a difference after a month of usage.But again, as other have noted, it does irritate the gum line. The floss heads are a little rough along the gums, sometimes causing a bit of bleeding if too much pressure and time is put to the gum areas. One simply has to be careful to not over-brush the gum line and all will be well with the rest of the mouth.The one star out of the five I took away for this review is because the brush has the problem with irritating gums, everything else is fine.The charging base is convenient, and the feel of the brush is solid.I recommend this product as a budget brush. I\'ve used the higher-end Oral-B professional unit, and I notice almost no difference with results between the two brushes."

I am happy to report that this is not the case in this instance.  In fact, I\'ve signed-up for the automatic delivery, and have not been disappointed.  Since I am predisposed to periodontal disease, I need a brush that will keep the gumline free of plaque and be able to reach under the gumline into the pockets.  This brush is ideal for that, and I have had no problems dealing  with this company.  So, you can rest assured that you will be getting the \'real thing.\'"

2170,2220,20110219,B002HWS9GG,5,"February 19, 2011",A2YE1AL84HPJ71,One of the best purchases I ever made.,"My dentist recommended that I start using an electric toothbrush. I  was not keen on the idea since my experience is that a machine toothbrush can eat up the gums. However, I shopped around at CVS, online and decided on the Professional Care Oral B brand. I just love it. It was easy to set up even for me not a gadget freak. It has a timer and action in the brush to let you know when to stop brushing. The brush heads will set you back, but you can find them on sale as well as cheaper generic versions. One caution, do not use an electric toothbrush more than twice a day and do not use much over the recommended two minutes otherwise you risk scratching the enamel on your teeth, not a good thing to do. I keep my manual garden variety brush on hand for brushing between meals and for air travel. I would hate to be the one to halt takeoff because I did not disable my toothbrush, see instructions that come with the brush."
