1,1,20120314,B0012IYKOG,5,"March 14, 2012",A37553726TM67U,GREAT,"I love the extra protection of length with these pads - I use them in daytime, for they don\'t feel bulky at all.  This is a very good price.  Very happy!"
2,2,20110524,B0012IYKOG,4,"May 24, 2011",A2T8JLXZ1WMXSU,The Best Value For The Money,"This price is the best I\'ve found (for 76 pads!!) I\'ve been using Always pads for years. Every time I\'ve tried other brands, I\'ve been disappointed. In my opinion, these are the best. However, calling them \'overnight\' is a bit of a stretch. Unless you are quite slender, with a light flow, one of these will not be sufficient for overnight use. But they are the best choice for daytime use in my opinion. They are ultra-thin and do not appear bulky under jeans or pants."
3,3,20080716,B0012IYKOG,5,"July 16, 2008",AP5BE47QGEXK0,Thank You,Thank you very much this is the only place that I could find this product at a reasonable price.

5,5,20110613,B001DWNTBG,1,"June 13, 2011",A18N6D7KETWNCB,I\'d Love to Describe Them... but I Never Received Them,"Like the other reviewer described - these just simply never showed. It stinks because when I ordered them, I got a message stating that the estimated ship date was more than a month away. That month came and went and nothing doing.You might want to order these elsewhere."
6,6,20101226,B001DWNTBG,4,"December 26, 2010",AZ1ICREELJZL0,"No wings, but still A-OK","I am not a pad-snob.  I usually buy what is most affordable (although I do avoid the really cheap pads).  I bought these only because of the price, but have been pretty satisfied.Nope, they don\'t have wings, but I experienced very little pad migration or movement.  These have stayed fairly secure; exactly where I place them.These pads are also decent absorbers.  I absolutely hate the cheapies that leave you uncomfortable during heavy flow, after a short period of time.  I don\'t remember having issues with these.  Good absorbers are sometimes too darn bulky, but I don\'t remember wearing these with close fitting pants and freaking out.I can also say these work pretty well for younger girls with less placement experience, which I wondered about when purchasing wing-less pads.In summary, while I can\'t say that I paid real close attention to this pad\'s performance when using, I can say that I don\'t remember making a mental note not to buy these again, no matter what the price was.  So, thumbs up, especially if you get them for a great sale price."
10,10,20110225,B001G7QSGQ,5,"February 25, 2011",A2KCD2PFUDXPPX,"Great product, excellent price","Always is a good brand, it holds up well, definitely superior to \'generic\', and the price is amazing, especially when you get a 15% discount for having it sent to you regularly. How convenient! And there are 3 packs of 44. No running to the store and paying a lot when you run out."
11,11,20081214,B001G7QSHU,5,"December 14, 2008",A17GK9E70O7Y9R,very best,"I have reviewed this before.....I have tried others, but this is the best.  Except for a subscription delay on this product, I have no complaints"
13,13,20090825,B001G7QUYQ,5,"August 25, 2009",A22RIIYSPA3EDH,This is the brand discriminating youth deserves,"Feminine products have come a loooong way since I was 11 and our choices were less than desirable and limited.  These pads are designed to cover every conceivable area that could result in embarrassment or unwanted staining, are extremely absorbent and not bulky to boot.  Even if one uses tampons, some may prefer using pads at night.  We find that the duration of our cycles is shortened and intensity of flow is lessened by doing this.  With 3 daughters, we know our way around feminine products and Always has always been our primary choice ever since it came to market.  The subscribe and save feature is so convenient and we love it.  No more last minute rushing to the store because you run out.  Recommend."
23,23,20111114,B001GCTTJY,5,"November 14, 2011",A18FTRFQQ141CP,Great!,Great pads! Not for heavy periods they are very think. I really did like these pads not Like the other maxi pads they give you a rash.
24,24,20111111,B001GCTTJY,5,"November 11, 2011",A1S73WZTW3PP8M,Love these for Postpartum Bleeding,"When I had my daughter 3.5 years ago these were the only pads that ended up not making a mess and could contain my postpartum bleeding.  I\'m not normally a pad fan, but the extra coverage made sure that I wasn\'t having to scrub panties by hand. I am due to deliver my 2nd in the next month, and trust me these will be the only pad I bother with. I cannot count how many I pitched in the trash before we found these."
29,29,20110706,B001GCTTJY,5,"July 6, 2011",A1PDR7PXW0CWQ1,so glad this is on amazon,"These are  perfect for me, and I am very happy to never go into a store again for these. I hope they stay on Amazon for a long while!"
32,32,20101111,B001GCTTJY,5,"November 11, 2010",A2M115XQ062TVX,Going with the flow..,I\'m allergic to most adhesives and bleaches so buying pads is pretty much not a happy thing for me - Always is the best on the market. I can use them without worrying about horrible rashes in places I don\'t want rashes to be.My one big complaint though is that it takes longer to process these for shipping than a regular order. seriously people..they\'re a little bag how long can it take to move the little bag from it\'s stack into a box?
36,36,20100508,B001GCTTJY,5,"May 8, 2010",A7ED6BJO320TG,These are just wonderful for overnight and for very heavy days!,"Always with wings, in general are wonderful. The wings keep from accidents and the cover keeps you dry feeling. The overnights are fantastic. They are extra long, very thin, and really keep from stains at night. Also for heavy days, they are extra protection what you can\'t feel at all. These usually cost a little bit more that the average pad but highly worth the peace of mind and less laundry."
38,38,20110605,B001LK6Q6K,5,"June 5, 2011",A1SM5FFHEAAHDQ,great price!,This product came just when expected with Prime Shipping and it was the best price that I\'ve found online or in stores.
40,40,20100716,B001LK6Q6K,5,"July 16, 2010",ABWWX6IWGD663,Great product,This is the only brand that I have been using for the last several years. No complains!
41,41,20101126,B001LK6Q92,5,"November 26, 2010",A40ULZ7N0PKXZ,good product,I have been using this brand for long long time but this was the first time that I ordered it online. The shipping is FAST! I got it after I placed the order two or three days after. The overnight Always is incredible. It is very long but you will still feel very comfortable since it is very thin. It gives you 100% protection at night and even day time. The price is very reasonable as well. I usually buy it online but now I am considering to get it from this website. Great product.
44,44,20120129,B001LK6QJW,5,"January 29, 2012",A1EHVHK8LA8LVF,Totally don\'t feel it,"These are great because you really don\'t fel them at all. Invicible and absurbing - I used them right after I had a baby and it held pretty good. A year later - still using them - not for heavy period of course, just every day."
50,50,20101118,B001LK6QJW,1,"November 18, 2010",A3VMF1KVRGUR6U,TINY!,"I use these for spotting but they\'re so thin and so tiny. If my panties move or bunch up, forget about it! Wish I hadn\'t bought a 240 pack!"
55,55,20090908,B001LK6QJW,3,"September 8, 2009",A39FXOW0UFENSL,Not what I thought it was,These are too small for my needs.  I thought I was getting something bigger.  Be careful to check your purchases thouroughly before buying!
56,56,20090514,B001LK6QJW,3,"May 14, 2009",ALNFHVS3SC4FV,Not For That Time of The Month,"The Always Thin pantiliners are a small, paper-thin liner that you won\'t even know that you are wearing. It\'s like the Carefree Breathables in that it doesn\'t have a plastic backing. If you are wanting a liner to keep you and your underware fresh on non-period days then this is a great liner.If you are wanting to use on days that you might just be spotting or as tampon backup, then this liner is not for you.I used one after my period was over, just in case, and sure enough, I spotted. It ruined my underware. It didn\'t leak off the sides but just soaked through.Just beware, these are just for refreshment only, not for that time of the month."
59,59,20110829,B001LK6XG8,1,"August 29, 2011",AHILADYPCTEJF,Two boxes contained defective products!!!,Two of the three boxes contained defective products. The liners were cut down the middle and tore easily while wearing. VERY UNHAPPY!
65,65,20120425,B00284B4PQ,5,"April 25, 2012",A1OUTBBULVU8N,Flexi-pads always difficult to find,"After searching in various cities, I have succumbed to buying these flexi-pads online.  They are so hard to find in stores, and like anyone else, I have only so much time to waste in brick and morter stores anyway.  So glad to have found them online."
67,67,20100325,B00284B4PQ,5,"March 25, 2010",A358D87VUQT72,Great Product,these are the best idea yet.  They fit regular panties and thong...plus they are the perfect thickness for everyday wear and those awful leaks.  So flexible you forget you\'re wearing one.
70,70,20100212,B00284B5AK,5,"February 12, 2010",A703NBX12U2JX,Just right!,"Always Dri-liners work perfectly without being too bulky. It fits nicely and stays put.Overall, I\'m very pleased with this product."
71,71,20120301,B0029NYPUC,5,"March 1, 2012",AOB9IYQVOA76U,this pad is \'growing\' with me.,"I am now 24, and am basically the same size I was in high school (smaller, actually). The design/doodles on the packaging seem to market these pads towards teens/smaller girls who are just starting their periods. I am a size 4-6, and these pads fit really well in my panties. I wear normal bikini/hiphugger panties that cannot seem to \'fit\' standard thin pads, with or without wings. This is the first pad where I actually was able to use the wings simply to secure and hold the pad in place...as opposed to normal/larger pads, with which I tend to use the wings as a \'belt\' to strap the pad into place, so that the wings significantly overlap on the outside of the panty material. really annoying, uncomfortable, and does not offer much leak protection. These slender pads are great - they do not seem to wick away moisture as well as some other pads with a cotton-y surface that remains dry while pulling moisture into the \'core\' of the pad. in fact, the \'mesh,\' surface layer of these pads seems to pull away from the bottom/stick part of the pad if they are too saturated. however, obviously, if your flow is that heavy, you should be changing your pad more often...lady life lessons!bottom-line though, there is no fault of these pads that outweigh the advantage of the appropriate size and \'stay-in-place\' fit. I hope to find them in other sizes/absorbencies, but for now, these are my go-to pads. GREAT price on amazon, these are often hard to find in my local stores and even with the regular P&G coupons, the price is better (with no trip to the store!) from amazon. couldn\'t be more pleased."
72,72,20120119,B0029NYPUC,5,"January 19, 2012",A769CQ59B7M26,Always Ultra Thin Slender,"Being a slender woman; these work just fine for me.I would prefer to buy Seventh Generation\'s chlorine free pads but they don\'t have the option of the slender fit.Otherwise, this product works for what\'s necessary."
74,74,20110925,B0029NYPUC,5,"September 25, 2011",A3AGVZC564PM6D,great for lighter days,"these are very petite, which works great for me on lighter days. it keeps me dry and doesn\'t leave any fun odors. win!"
76,76,20110517,B0029NYPUC,5,"May 17, 2011",A3SP7Q41PG4ZGP,Excellent for teenagers or petite frames,My teenage daughter really loves these.  She is very thin and has a very narrow frame.  Basically she\'s 5\' 5\' and a size 0.  She didn\'t like the standard Always Ultra Thins because she felt they were too wide.  I was thrilled to have found these on Amazon.com.  They work very well for her.
78,78,20120324,B0029NYPXO,5,"March 24, 2012",AYMRN27MH5IJ0,Good Product,The wipes could stand to be a bit bigger but overall its a good product.  Does what it\'s suppose to do and its a GREAT deal for the price. I ran out and decided to look on amazon to see if I can get it at a good price and yes I did. I keep a few in My purse at all times.  Good product if you want that fresh feeling at all times.

I keep them on the back of the toilet and use them as a way to quickly freshen up, or for clean up...after... :o)  My boyfriend even uses them for himself.  I won\'t go without having wipes in the bathroom anymore.  I\'m not a huge fan of the scent, but oh well."

98,98,20110714,B0029NYPZ2,5,"July 14, 2011",AS1B3PEWQWLDV,Great feeling of freshness after each use!,"Don\'t know what to say about this but i like it a lot. Each one comes in their own container. The container is good because it helps to preserve the liquid in the wipes without drying out. I use these quite often when I need to feel fresh after using the bathroom. Because i like it so much, I bought the To Go ones as well.For anyone who is worried about possible infections, that was my original worry at first, but I\'ve had no problem at all.I would definitely recommend this to anyone."

Our grocery store was was out of overnight regulars, but had the infinity.  I had seen it advertised on TV and thought whoo hoo a slender reliable product, NOT! I will Never buys these again!"

118,118,20120221,B0029NYQ2E,2,"February 21, 2012",ANDSFDPKUQ1Q4,Not absorbent enough for me!,"Seems like mixed reviews for this, so I thought I should put my 2 cents in to add to the confusion. I was impressed with the quality of the pad; definitely explains why it cost more. Its actually quite thin compared to other pads that claim \'heavy absorbency\' , and the texture/density reminds me of  a makeup applicator sponge. The double wings was a good idea, but like some of the reviewers have mentioned- it did not seems to stick as well to certain underwear, and if it can\'t be relied on to stick well on EVERY underwear in your drawer, well- the reliability issue is moot already! And reliability is important if your are out and about, in and out of chairs, meeting with people constantly, and can\'t always run to the restroom when you feel that doomsday leakage- b/c then,  please don\'t rely on this pad.  When I have a heavy day- its heavy like Niagara Falls heavy where it feels like 1/2 pint just unleashes in one split second (sorry for the graphics, but I\'m trying to make a point, and those who have my type of heavy will know exactly what I mean), and this little fella just did not do it for me on a busy day when I don\'t have a restroom to run to. The absorbency rate on this high-tech pad is TOO SLOW for my type of \'Unleash thy furry\' Heavy days, and it just seemed to spill over the side like a shallow raft that can not contain its occupants (while going over the edge of Niagara Falls).  Every time I wore it on a heavy day, my underwear was dirtied to the extent where an extra pair of underwear was necessary! Does it sound gross? Yes- it was.  It you want to avoid grossness, do avoid this pad!  I saved the pad for my guaranteed light days and was able to finish my high tech pads in that manner, but I would not buy this again. Too bad- it does look and feel promising.  Hope my frank and honest review helps out any undecided non-tampon users."
119,119,20120117,B0029NYQ2E,5,"January 17, 2012",AHUIJO0GPTZGO,Best ever for post-partum flow,"I am not a pad user generally, but I tried these pads after I had my baby.  I was amazed at how well they worked for the extremely heavy flow that comes after having a vaginal birth.  They kept me pretty comfortable and were a HUGE improvement (comfort-wise) over the pads they give you in the hospital.  They are so thin and light, but still absorb and contain an amazing amount.  I am ordering more to have with me at the hospital when I have this baby."
121,121,20111216,B0029NYQ2E,3,"December 16, 2011",A2SLZMD0UYRT5X,ALWAYS WITH WINGS,These new pads are okay.They\'re a bit short in size.It does hold the volume required.But requires to use 2 pads for moderate protection.
127,127,20110925,B0029NYQ2E,5,"September 25, 2011",A3AGVZC564PM6D,i can never go back,"i thought these were just expensive versions of the regular Always pads, but i was so wrong. whatever sponge thing they use in these is kind of magical. you feel so dry like you\'re wearing regular underwear and they can take in a lot. it\'s almost like it\'s sucking it out of me. i don\'t think i can ever go back. i almost look forward to using them. ALMOST."
128,128,20110917,B0029NYQ2E,5,"September 17, 2011",AWNQ2PULUBHDH,Amazing and worth trying!,"I can\'t believe I\'m actually writing a review for this, but I\'ve used Always Infinity for about a year now and I have to admit that I actually stock up on these pads.  I\'m really sorry that others haven\'t had the good results I have, but I can\'t help wondering if they didn\'t read the **UNSCENTED** description or what.For the convenience and absorbency of these pads, they can\'t be beat (trust me, I\'ve tried them all for almost 3 decades now)!  These are made from what I can only describe as a \'Dr. Scholl\'s-like\' material.  The pad is VERY comfortable and definitely breathes.  If you\'re an active female, or have an extremely heavy flow, then you should definitely be conscious of having to change out the pad throughout the day.  These Infinity pads are SUPER absorbent - what\'s seen on the surface of the pad is only about 1/3 of what\'s actually being held.  So please keep that in mind.  I normally have a heavy flow and sometimes had issues at night (I sleep on my belly) and that was always a big problem during \'my time\' when the pad I\'d use would leak.  Not at all the case with these!Always Infinity DOES tend to cost more than other brands, but if you keep an eye out (as I do) you can find a decent in-store sale.  For the convenience of having these delivered, the Amazon price is on-par with what these are retailing for."

Even though they are expensive I always luck up on a coupon when I need more. Now that i have found these on amazon I will start buying them from here instead of from the store. Since if I buy these in the store I would be paying $14.00 for two boxes. Great save, great deal, great product."

So every month for 5 days since I was ten, I\'ve had to suffer with basically a plastic diaper in my pants. The itchiness, the unbreathable plastic, the bulk. So a few months ago I got a sample of these in my regular box of pads, and all I can say is that I\'m hooked! No more plastic sticking to your butt. No more wet diaper feeling. No more bunching up in your underwear. No more wishing I was a bigger girl so that I could enjoy the freedom of tampons. The only thing that would make them better for me is if the had a wingless version, (I\'ve never really needed wings on my pads,) and a smaller, light flow day version. They are slightly longer (and wider in the rear) than the average pad but for me that is an improvement as I have felt that many pads available were too short, meaning I had to be careful how I sat/reclined when using one. Girls with heavy flows may still find these inadequate but as a moderate flow girl I find these to be better than the regular maxi pad. Did I mention They\'re so much more comfortable? Love, love, love."
136,136,20100728,B0029NYQ2E,5,"July 28, 2010",ARV4ZFNASFQAM,Comfortabel and Absorbant,There is a very noticeable difference in the comfort level between infinity and the previous ultra thin pads. The infinity is much more comfortable and thin so it doesn\'t feel bulky and you you hardly notice it\'s there. It is very absorbant so you don\'t have to worry about leaks. And the wings are always a plus. It hold in place very well.

So SOFT, GREAT PROTECTION, Doesnt irritate like others!","First of all, I love these because it doesnt irritate you like all other pads out there. I love Always, and have always used this brand, but now I will never use anyother class from Always except the Infinity. These Always infinity does its job! I use to use the bulky kind the first few days, as I am extremely heavy, then the regular thin ones the last couple days, but they would irritate me so bad! I would literally have a \'diaper rash\' down there. But one day I sent my husband to the store to buy me some, and he brought me the Infinity. I was at first disappointed because they were so thin! I did not expect them to work so darn well! My husband was so scared that it wouldnt work and that I would be upset with him for buying the wrong ones, but I am now soooo glad he did. I will never use anyother ones besides these Infinity.Mainly because they are so soft. It feels like those packing styrophome thin sheets that they wrap around the TV screen when you first open the box. That type of smooth and cushiny type feel, just thicker than this sheet. And when I finally ran out, I had to borrow my moms other thins pads (not the infinity) and I only used it for two days and it irritated me again. So if you have that problem, get these. The really really absorb and are exremely soft! Its like magic. I dont see how its possible that it can absorb so much but it does!"

This time around I decided on trying Infinity based on the description and a sale at the grocery store.  I was amazed.  They are thin, the top stays pretty much dry/a bit damp, and they absorb a lot.  Of course, each woman\'s body is different so this may not be the same for you.I travel and live a lot in countries where I may not be able to make it to a washroom to change my pad for quite some time, and these have held up immensely.  Even plane, train, automobile travel - no issues.  I started passing out a couple at a time to friends to try because I find them so revolutionary."

What I didn\'t like is the chemical smell that it had when I first started buying them (the ones I\'ve bought recently doesn\'t have this smell anymore).

I LOVE THESE.They are so comfortable that you will forget they are there. The shape is unique and REALLY fits. You gals know what I\'m talking about when I say the regular pads always bunch up. These just don\'t.These puppies also do NOT stick to you. That\'s another thing that some pads do -these have not stuck once. They are plenty absorbent with absolutely no leakage at all.Once I went to these I just could not go back to any other type. I tried. I really did. In the end I put the other pads in the closet for emergencies and these front and center for monthly use. Highly recommended!

I just thought that I was going to be stuck changing my sheets and morning messes for the rest of my period life. When I first tried these I was like these are really long but they really really work. I have no more messes and everything is caught by the pad. I told my friend about them and she laughed at me when I told her how long they were and how they had like 4 wings. I let her try one and she now buys them. I am so glad I found them here so now I can buy more at one time for a cheaper price.

I\'ve tried many, many brands but NOTHING worked. They claim they are \'super long\', \'heavy duty\', \'overnight\', but there were still leaks! Luckily I found this one. It\'s the only pad that really works!!! It\'s amazing. Some reviewer complained that it\'s like a diaper, I guess she does not have heavy period like me. It works because it is long and thick - thus looks like a diaper. I\'m so happy that I\'ve finally found THE overnight pad for me."

They truly provide maximum protection! As the other reviewers before me stated, I too had to use towels, double up on overnight pads and use a tampon just to go to sleep without the worry of staining! I am truly glad Always decided to make a product that delivers! I hated going to bed with a tampon, risking getting Toxic Shock syndrome, but it was the only thing that somewhat worked.There is nothing bad to say about this product! I don\'d mind the bulkiness of it, nor do I mind the length of it.Side Bar: But one thing I do have to note is that my menstrual started getting lighter since being diagnosed with anemia and taking iron pills daily. A heavy period is not normal, so for those experiencing a heavy cycle, check with your doc.A lot of my symptoms (extreme cramping, heavy clotting, heavy flow, etc), besides PMS, have subsided since taking iron pills, working out and eating more healthy foods. I keep these pads on deck and only use these pads maybe once during my cycle on my most heavy day, which isn\'t nearly as heavy as it once was. So they have lasted me for quite a while.Sorry for the side bar, but I had to add that in there in case some of you have been wondering why you are having such heavy cycles.At any rate, this product works! Go out and get it and keep it in stock for your just in case days!"

They worked very well, but the wings could be a bugger to get set right sometimes especially if the folded or something while you put them on.As an alternative, I do recommend cloth pads (there are some really great ones available out there.) They wash up really easy in my experience and you don\'t have to worry about chemicals. I also end up having less leaks, less itchiness etc when using cloth pads.Another alternative that I highly recommend is a menstrual cup. I have a seriously heavy flow and menstrual cups work wonderfully. (I\'m talking about the silicone kind that you wash and reuse)They hold about twice as much flow as a tampon and I wear cloth pads or liners for back up. I can wear a menstrual cup comfortably but I\'m unable to wear tampons. Most tampons are also full of icky chemicals.Natracare is a good brand of disposable menstrual protection that doesn\'t have all the icky chemicals if you just can\'t bring yourself to try the other things or if you need something disposable sometimes."

They absorb quickly and keep you feeling drier and the wings are wonderful for providing extra protection.  I just wish that pad makers would stop making the outside wrapper so bright in color.  It\'s hard to be discreet with a bright green wrapper announcing to the world that you have your period.JUST A NOTE: I didn\'t write this review - my wife did."

I usually don\'t like improvements because to me that is usually code for taking away something good about the product in order to make a cheaper product to produce and cut back on the quality.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with how well the new technology worked to absorb away from your body. Even on my heaviest days I didn\'t have any leaks and I didn\'t feel bulky as I sometimes can feel. The new design has a wider back and channels that help with faster absorption. The only problem that I have with this product is that the adhesive is not strong enough on the wings, but besides that I think I can finally say I\'ve found an improvement I like. Great job Always."

They are of the thin absorbent variety, which avoids the diaper feeling.  The adhesive sticks well, which is always important.  The new wing design is better shaped to fit the contours of panties than flat wings.  While there are special channels and different shaped openings in the top layer, I am not convinced that the actual effect is significantly different than with other thin absorbent pads. The shape is wider at the back which is good for overnight use.  And while not really significant, the packaging is prettier.  Bottom line, the pads are better designed but I wouldn\'t pay a premium over other pads of this type."

Sometimes the scented pads can be full of irritating perfumes, but this is not bad.  Thus the definition of \'lightly scented.\'  I don\'t want to feel like someone dumped a whole bottle of perfume on me when I open the package.  Especially since I have allergies. Practical product that does the job."

I didn\'t realize it until I tracked the sickly sweet odor coming from my purse to an emergency liner I\'d stashed there. I checked Amazon again and discovered that if you zoom way in on the product photo, you can see \'lightly scented\' written in tiny letters at the bottom. I\'m hoping they still make these in an unscented version, because the scented ones smell like formaldehyde."

The cover is destroyed when I try t remove the pad.  This has happened when I have opened 3 covers to remove the pad and the cover is destroyed and cannot be used to dispose of a used pad.

386,390,20110414,B005P0SMW8,5,"April 14, 2011",AYBUXK93WSTNN,Excellent Product Helps w/ Eczema,"Please read my review, as I hope it helps others dealing with severe skin conditions.I hope Warren Laboratories stays in business for a very, very, very long time.  My son has a severe peanut allergy, and apparently with allergies comes eczema (skin condition that causes open sores).  We\'ve used steroids with limited results, and we don\'t like using it very much nor does my son as it\'s a pretty strong medicine.For some reason, my memory was triggered and I remembered my Japanese mother growing aloe plants and using them on us when we had an injury or received a burn (happens when you grow up on a farm).  I wasn\'t thinking of prevention, but healing his open sores that were getting pretty bad--on his arms, behind his legs, on his feet, and on his inner thighs.  (He is entering his teenage years, and is obviously very sensitive about his skin.  The kids at school always ask why he wears long pants, and not shorts like they do in school and after school).Long story short, I came across \'George\'s Aloe\' and thought what the heck, can\'t hurt.  It\'s a natural product and worth a try.  I also read that Aloe is a natural antihistimine.  We\'ve been using it for a week on our son, and the results are very positive.  It hasn\'t prevented the outbreaks, but it has diminished them noticeably.  I would say upwards of 80% improvement.  The spring is the worst time for my son, and it\'s been very manageable.  My wife and I have noticed a significant improvement in his condition and he drinks a small glass of George\'s Aloe every morning.  I tried it, and it indeed does take like water.  Read the directions, though, as you don\'t need much.I\'ve since supplemented the \'internal\' treatment with an external treatment of the actual aloe plant rubbed on the outside of his body (arms, legs, feet, etc.).  You basically just cut off a very small part of the leaf, and it\'s a gel inside.  I rub that on his sores, pimples, and hives and paired with the Aloe juice, has had a dramatic effect, a definite improvement for the better.  My son is much more relaxed of late, and very happy with the results.  It\'s not perfect by any means, but he itches a LOT less and he doesn\'t have the open weeping sores that he had before.  Again, it\'s not perfect, but a huge improvement.I think for others in the same situation, it\'s worth a try.  I would just make sure there isn\'t some sort of allergy to it--but I\'ve never heard of an allergic reaction to Aloe.Finally, my wife has tried a lot of remedies on my son: lotions, aforementioned steroids, hot showers followed by vaseline to keep the moisture in, etc., and none of them has had the same noticeable positive effect as Warren Laboratories \'George\'s Aloe\'.A very enthusiastic and strong 5 Stars for this product.I hope you find a use for it, too."

I have been on Nexium for 5+ years & get a little concerned about taking it for so long, even though my gastroenterologist says it\'s fine. I have not been able to go one day without taking Nexium until I started drinking George\'s Aloe. A friend of mine heard about George\'s Aloe from her holistic pharmacist. George\'s Aloe has no taste or texture - it\'s like drinking water. I drink about 2 oz. every other day - the days I don\'t take Nexium.Another side benefit is that my hair is thicker. My beautician noticed that my hair wasn\'t falling out like it used to, and we attributed it to George\'s Aloe.One of the reasons I decided aloe might work for me is because when I was visiting St. John, USVI, I went on an island tour. Our tour guide pulled to the side of the road & showed us an aloe plant. He said that when their babies get sick, they put a little aloe in their baby bottles & they get better. Apparently aloe also helps with thinning mucus.So many uses for aloe, who knew? Now you do!"
