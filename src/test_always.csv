They are thin, absorbent, and fit snuggly into my panties just like my other pads.  In fact, they hide my feminine needs from the boys even better.  I now wear one every gym class."

Every time I\'ve tried other brands, I\'ve been disappointed. In my opinion, these are the best. However, calling them \'overnight\' is a bit of a stretch. Unless you are quite slender, with a light flow, one of these will not be sufficient for overnight use. But they are the best choice for daytime use in my opinion. They are ultra-thin and do not appear bulky under jeans or pants."

I bought these only because of the price, but have been pretty satisfied.Nope, they don\'t have wings, but I experienced very little pad migration or movement.  These have stayed fairly secure; exactly where I place them.These pads are also decent absorbers.  I absolutely hate the cheapies that leave you uncomfortable during heavy flow, after a short period of time.  I don\'t remember having issues with these.  Good absorbers are sometimes too darn bulky, but I don\'t remember wearing these with close fitting pants and freaking out.I can also say these work pretty well for younger girls with less placement experience, which I wondered about when purchasing wing-less pads.In summary, while I can\'t say that I paid real close attention to this pad\'s performance when using, I can say that I don\'t remember making a mental note not to buy these again, no matter what the price was.  So, thumbs up, especially if you get them for a great sale price."

I\'m not normally a pad fan, but the extra coverage made sure that I wasn\'t having to scrub panties by hand. I am due to deliver my 2nd in the next month, and trust me these will be the only pad I bother with. I cannot count how many I pitched in the trash before we found these."

I can use them without worrying about horrible rashes in places I don\'t want rashes to be.My one big complaint though is that it takes longer to process these for shipping than a regular order. seriously people..they\'re a little bag how long can it take to move the little bag from it\'s stack into a box?

For women who have a heavy flow, this type of pad can hold up quite well without any spills or staining on clothing/bedsheets."

The wings keep from accidents and the cover keeps you dry feeling. The overnights are fantastic. They are extra long, very thin, and really keep from stains at night. Also for heavy days, they are extra protection what you can\'t feel at all. These usually cost a little bit more that the average pad but highly worth the peace of mind and less laundry."

As a nurse, I have heard every combination of pads and tampons for nighttime coverage.  Conducting some studies myself, I am convinced this is a superior product and will simplify the horrendous nighttime guessing game.  The pad can hold an amazing amount of flow without spilling onto bedlinens and is very comfortable.  Thanks for getting this one right at long last!"

Many years ago, I found pads by Always that were geared for women who wear sizes 14 and up -- and have since had difficulty being able to consistently find them.The difference is that the pads for sizes 14 and up are longer and offer more protection. I found that Overnight pads are about the same length, and can be helpful in a pinch. But this review is not about the pads.Over the last few years, I have been fortunate enough to lose some weight, and with it, find myself with a generally lighter flow. Pads can get costly, especially when they are barely used, and I found the Always Pantyliners, which did me decently well.The last time I needed pads and liners, I found myself (newly unemployed) in sticker-shock at the drugstore. Sometimes, I guess we forget just how much the odds and ends cost when we\'re not thinking about money. So I came to Amazon, and in looking for my products, found the Always Pantyliner - made for sizes 14 and up. I did not know this existed, but I quickly decided to go ahead and make the purchase in liu of the regular pantyliner.The size is slightly longer and wider, and I am so much more comfortable that there is more coverage. I\'m glad Always has taken larger women into consideration, and every plus size woman should know that there is a product out there to protect her, too!"

They are so hard to find in stores, and like anyone else, I have only so much time to waste in brick and morter stores anyway.  So glad to have found them online."

I just bought the Always dri-liners with OdorLock and don\'t like them.  The thin top layer doesn\'t stay put and bunches up, unlike the regular +14 panty liners, without the thin top odor layer.  The store where I usually purchase them had only the ones with OdorLock so that is why I bought them.  I will go back to the +14 panty liners if I can find them."
71,71,20120301,B0029NYPUC,5,"March 1, 2012",AOB9IYQVOA76U,this pad is \'growing\' with me.,"I am now 24, and am basically the same size I was in high school (smaller, actually). The design/doodles on the packaging seem to market these pads towards teens/smaller girls who are just starting their periods. I am a size 4-6, and these pads fit really well in my panties. I wear normal bikini/hiphugger panties that cannot seem to \'fit\' standard thin pads, with or without wings. This is the first pad where I actually was able to use the wings simply to secure and hold the pad in place...as opposed to normal/larger pads, with which I tend to use the wings as a \'belt\' to strap the pad into place, so that the wings significantly overlap on the outside of the panty material. really annoying, uncomfortable, and does not offer much leak protection. These slender pads are great - they do not seem to wick away moisture as well as some other pads with a cotton-y surface that remains dry while pulling moisture into the \'core\' of the pad. in fact, the \'mesh,\' surface layer of these pads seems to pull away from the bottom/stick part of the pad if they are too saturated. however, obviously, if your flow is that heavy, you should be changing your pad more often...lady life lessons!bottom-line though, there is no fault of these pads that outweigh the advantage of the appropriate size and \'stay-in-place\' fit. I hope to find them in other sizes/absorbencies, but for now, these are my go-to pads. GREAT price on amazon, these are often hard to find in my local stores and even with the regular P&G coupons, the price is better (with no trip to the store!) from amazon. couldn\'t be more pleased."
76,76,20110517,B0029NYPUC,5,"May 17, 2011",A3SP7Q41PG4ZGP,Excellent for teenagers or petite frames,My teenage daughter really loves these.  She is very thin and has a very narrow frame.  Basically she\'s 5\' 5\' and a size 0.  She didn\'t like the standard Always Ultra Thins because she felt they were too wide.  I was thrilled to have found these on Amazon.com.  They work very well for her.

I got them for camping, hiking, and backpacking -- those times when you don\'t have the comforts of a bathroom.  These wipes are lightweight, portable, and definitely do the job.

The container is good because it helps to preserve the liquid in the wipes without drying out. I use these quite often when I need to feel fresh after using the bathroom. Because i like it so much, I bought the To Go ones as well.For anyone who is worried about possible infections, that was my original worry at first, but I\'ve had no problem at all.I would definitely recommend this to anyone."

108,108,20111026,B0029NYQ1K,5,"October 26, 2011",A2ZTGDUXSTH50G,LOVE them!,"These pads are amazing! One thing I\'ve always hated about pads is that weird rubbery plasticky feeling they had. These are slim and almost feel like cotton (well, for a pad that is). But really I love them because they seriously absorb everything. The other pads wouldn\'t really absorb everything, making me feel gross and unhygienic. And I\'m not even talking about after leaving the pad on for that long. These pads, I\'m guessing with the help of the \'tunnels,\' absorb everything so it\'s all at the bottom of the pad, away from the body. From now on, these are always my pad of choice."

I\'ve used so may overnight brands during the daytime and had them fail on me.  I tell you, I feel secure riding the train to work and traveling over an hour to visit family.  I will have to admit though that I have to wear two Ultra tampons at the same time (yes two) while I wear the pad.  But if I used any other brand of pads I\'d be in trouble so this one buys me more time in between changes.  I dread using anything else when I fall asleep because I\'d have to get up several times a night. Always allows me to sleep and I only have to change once during the night.  So this will be my lifeling purchase, that is, until I remove these suckers!"

I\'ve used them for two months and have found them to be non-obsorbent. They\'re also too slender, except in the back. I can\'t count how many accidents I\'ve had while wearing them. I would never buy them again. I\'m sticking with Always Ultra Thins and the regular thick pad in the blue bag."

What a difference!  The pad is thin, yet very absorbent.  The wings are perfect, and the material is the softest that I have ever come in contact with. I have many skin allergies, but this product doesn\'t cause a reaction.  I\'m hooked!"

Wish I hadn\'t ... the adhesive doesn\'t stick to anything but itself, so the pad bunches, AND it doesn\'t absorb worth anything.  I ruined the clothes I was wearing for the first time in many years because these things don\'t absorb as quickly or as much as Always Ultra-Thin pads.  Plus, they\'re more expensive than the Ultra-Thins.  Bottom line: don\'t bother."

First of all, I have been a long-time Always pad user, and very happy the wing products.  Thought I would try the Infinity model, to see what the hype was about.  BIG MISTAKE!  The pad LEAKS, LEAKS, runs off the top and bottom (but doesn\'t seem to leak through the pad).  I believe there was another reviewer who writes about a water test, where a significant amount of the fluid ran off rather than absorbing into the pad.  Infinity is definitely not comparable in protection to the Always Wings Super or Overnight variety, which NEVER leaks from any angle.  Second, Infinity feels \'wet\' against the skin, which is absolutely unacceptable when wearing for several hours.  Third, for the cost - get the superior absorbancy pad, the standard wings-style Always super or overnight protection.  I guess if you have very light periods, then the Infinity will work for you.  Anything other than very light - I\'d recommend the Always Wings varieties."

So every month for 5 days since I was ten, I\'ve had to suffer with basically a plastic diaper in my pants. The itchiness, the unbreathable plastic, the bulk. So a few months ago I got a sample of these in my regular box of pads, and all I can say is that I\'m hooked! No more plastic sticking to your butt. No more wet diaper feeling. No more bunching up in your underwear. No more wishing I was a bigger girl so that I could enjoy the freedom of tampons. The only thing that would make them better for me is if the had a wingless version, (I\'ve never really needed wings on my pads,) and a smaller, light flow day version. They are slightly longer (and wider in the rear) than the average pad but for me that is an improvement as I have felt that many pads available were too short, meaning I had to be careful how I sat/reclined when using one. Girls with heavy flows may still find these inadequate but as a moderate flow girl I find these to be better than the regular maxi pad. Did I mention They\'re so much more comfortable?

I MEAN IT WORKED FOR A FEW HOURS, BUT YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE THING INTO THE CREVICE TO MAKE SURE IT\'S THERE. STRAIGHT UP CHEAPIFIED CRAP.

The infinity is much more comfortable and thin so it doesn\'t feel bulky and you you hardly notice it\'s there. It is very absorbant so you don\'t have to worry about leaks. And the wings are always a plus. It hold in place very well.

I don\'t even know what I would do without it. Ever since I switched to using the Infinity, I have seriously not been able to go back to anything else. At a certain level, this is almost a problem. I was staying at my sister\'s for a few days when I got my period unexpectedly, and she doesn\'t use these. So, when I had to use her regular pads, I was in hell for a day and half until I could go buy some of the Infinity pads. But, lesson learned. I stash one or two in every place I can in case of emergencies (ex: travel bags, different purses, cosmetics bag, you name it) so I never have to stress out again. It is just so comfortable, I sometimes forget that I\'m on my period and wearing a pad (leading to a danger of remembering to change). If women out there have not used these yet, I cannot urge you enough to switch to the Always Infinity. It honestly is a miracle for women using pads. I was explaining to a friend how much I like these and used the phrase, \'Magic Pad.\' Seriously, it is. You may laugh but I don\'t think I can EVER use anything else."

Not a big fan of the tampon, but I wore them when I jogged because the thick pads just rubbed me the wrong way. It was nice to find a good exercise buddy in the infinity pad."

So I had to shoot the deer, which left even more blood, deer brain splatter, and mess all over the floor.  My neighbor lady went to the store to get more Maxi pads to clean it all up, but when she was gone, I decided it was best to just burn her house down.

If you\'re like me and always get so paranoid about leakage at night that you end up lying stiff straight on your bed and always sleep badly during your period, then THIS IS FOR YOU.I stumbled across this one by accident, as not all stores carry this particular size (at least not a couple of years ago).  Ever since then there is not a single day in my house that I don\'t have a pack of this stored in my cabinet, it\'s THAT essential.As I said before, I tend to sleep really badly during my period because i\'m so paranoid of moving at night and allowing leakage onto my sheets (which are a pain to wash out!)  Let\'s just say my crankiness during that time isn\'t all attributed to hormones!  After I started using this one though, aside from the usual cramps and back soreness, nothing else would affect my sleep.This pad is almost like twice the size of a normal day-time heavy pad, or 1.5x size of the old overnight pad I used to use.  The best thing about this, is that not only is it super long so that it covers all the way up to the top of your butt crack, it also has extra wing in that back area that spreads out and allows for more protection.  If you ever had issues where the old overnight is long enough, but liquid would leak on the side when you sleep on your side, then this will get rid of that problem.It is a huge pad though (my friend, who never used it before, when she saw me buying it she thought it was as big as a diaper x___x ) but I wouldn\'t want any thinner pad (even in the same shape and size) if only because the thinner it is, the less i feel protected.  And no matter what, I always want to be protected from leakage, not to mention being able to sleep better!also i only use this for the first 2-4 days or until the flow gets slow so that leakage won\'t really happen any more.  during the day or during the trailing part of my period, i switch back to regular sized pads."

I have fibroids now, so I bleed very heavy.  If I didn\'t have these pads,  I\'d flow like the ocean.  So yeah,  these pads are great.  They last about twice as long as the regular pads do.

Seriously, though, these pads are the best available right now for those of us who are tired of the monthly hassles of staining sheets while sleeping and pants while sitting for long periods of time.  I\'ve been using Always pads for years now because I found them to be the most comfortable and effective option on the market, but even their overnight pads couldn\'t keep up with my body on heavy days, not to mention the crime scene-style sheet stains that would greet me in the morning if I rolled onto my back while sleeping.  With these, though, I can sleep without fear!  The pad is very long and provides great coverage for the back of the underpants, where blood tends to flow, especially while lying on one\'s back.  If you\'re used to tampons or super-thin pads, I\'m sure one of these will feel like a diaper, but as someone used to needing to wear overnight pads, I find them quite comfortable and not at all bothersome.  I\'ll keep buying \'em as long as Always keeps making \'em."

No it\'s not thin.  It isn\'t supposed to be.The pad is a GREAT 15\' LONG.  Offering more protection where the flow goes which is toward our buttocks than any other on the market.  I for one am tired of connecting two pads to get any semblance of protection.  Even light flow doesn\'t go straight down, not if you have thighs which meet.  Some of you are complaining that its too big, well there are plenty more petite pads on the market if you indeed need a smaller pad but for those with a heavy flow and for women above a size 14 who have a big booty we need to APPLAUD THIS PAD for finally arriving for us.  I don\'t know why the industry didn\'t realize a century ago that you shouldn\'t be trying to make pads the same dimension when women range from 4\'9\' to 6\'7\'.  A 6-7\' long pad doesn\'t even protect the most direct fluid route if you\'re a larger lady. Lying down, flow goes awry even more so and for a pad to actually deserve the title OVERNIGHT it needs to come with a nice old old fashioned belting system (just a little strip folks) and truly be more like 22\' inches long.  We need a pad to reach from tummy to back of your waist if it is to prevent all staining and allow us to go to sleep without worry.  These pads don\'t do that and I wish they did.I still say manufacturers have no idea what a heavy flow is but I\'m afraid these are as good as its gets when it come to holding a lot blood. Good for postpartum.  If you have adenomyosis, fibroids, endometriosis, are in peri-menopause or GOD FORBID ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS, I\'m afraid even this pad will need frequent changing.  Do Diapers work as an alternative?  The answer is \'not so well\' as they are made of textiles meant to absorb a dilute fluid not a thick fluid.  Until Proctor and Gamble gets it right the natural green brand of diapers- TUSHIES in its largest size helps some with overnight woes.  If you are a tiny woman you might even be able to actually get one on completely, unwieldy to use (nothing to hold them on).  Alas they are kind to sensitive skin.Back to these pads...For comfort no one ever beats ALWAYS.  They have made the best \'tops\', the surface that touches your skin, for over 2 decades.  In other words they feel great and do stay dry.  These don\'t have the texture of their new Infinity line but instead have that sort of plastic lace top Always came out with back in the late 70s early 80s. I wish that they applied the Infinity odor control and material to THIS SIZE.  Layer the INFINITY textile over this pad.  That combination of materials I think would be a SMASH HIT!  Listen to MEEEE P&G.A word about those darned wings.  All they do is channel moisture toward your groin and hold it there against your skin to make you chafe.  They never stay in place.  They don\'t spare your pretty panties anything.  Take them away!  I tuck them under [or scissor them off].This pad has an adhesive strip protector sheet on top, and another on its back. I welcome that.  When was the last time you saw a women wash her hands BEFORE entering a stall?  You\'re handling a pad with your paws covered with every bacteria from elevator buttons, escalator rails, filthy knobs, currency, tickets, and other person\'s hands and then putting all those bad particles there.  That TOP protective sheet lets you get the pad on without transferring all that mayhem to your groin. That area needs to be handled as sterile-y (is that a word?) as you handle your eyes but no one seems to ever say that.  I wish pads were marked STERILE and were indeed that pristine.INCONTINENCE, these are useless for that purpose.  Add Always Max Protection Dri Liners.  They are as thin as a sheet of paper.  And as teeny as they are (really short) they do hold liquid and boost the performance of any pad they are added to.  Their adhesive is strong, stronger even than on these full size pads. They do not come with any kind of wrapper.I\'m switching back to Always from Natracare.  Went there to avoid chemicals and because there was a sort of quiet underground buzz abut Always is just not being sterile enough in their manufacturing and indeed causing infections but with heavy use Natracare\'s SUPER is irritating and their Nighttime Extra Long is woefully not up to par but if you want less of a pad than these they just might be right for you.  I\'m hoping P&G is making these in at least a CLEAN environment despite the fact that you never see the term STERILE in a sanitary product description.  I think it ought to be there especially for tampons.I DO RECOMMEND THESE FOR HEAVIER FLOW DAYS but unless your body is neater than mine you\'ll still stain sheets until manufacturers really bring the pad to waist.  That\'s just the simple unattractive truth of the matter.Finally the pads are WHITE, my flash may be making them look pink or purple.SOAP dot com with their great 15-20% off coupons and Amazon are running neck and neck on price.For Natracare the best price I\'ve found is at Lucky Vitamin  The Nighttime Extra Long was $3.45 for 10."

I\'ve always had a problem with being, shall we say... extra juicy. :) So, pantyliners are a staple item at my house. When it came down to choosing between Always & Carefree, a quick whiff of the package determined the clear winner. Carefree possessed an awful, overpowering floral scent that made me want to gag. It was the same stench that I had detected in many public restrooms, combined with *other* odors I dare not mention. OTOH, Always had a fresh, light, clean scent that was not the least bit cloying. Always is like a gentle breeze, whereas Carefree is comparable to a full-blown F5 tornado... with the lifeless carcasses of a few livestock caught up in the funnel. Always is simply the best choice for any woman/girl who seeks good absorption combined with a *slight* fragrance. The problem with highly-scented pantyliners is that, when combined with bodily fluids, they emit some extremely revolting fumes (exactly what I smelt in the public restrooms). Besides, who wants a pantyliner that will undermine your perfume? Who wants to hear \'Hey, what\'s that smell coming from your crotch\'? This will never be a problem with Always. But, scent factor aside, I also love these because they are thin, stay in place reasonably well (with the exception of profuse sweating), absorb a moderate amount of moisture... and I really dig the light blue wrappers (I hate pink; another reason why I\'m put-off by Carefree). :PConclusion: These pantyliners rule.

They should remark the packages to be small, medium, and long version.  In addition, the pads themselves are super flimsy to the point where they instantly bunch and become uncomfortable.  The flimsiness makes it so the adhesive doesn\'t stand a chance at your backside.  Worthless!RESEARCHERS, PRODUCT DEVELOPERS, AND MARKETERS AT P&G:  Go back to your former SUPERIOR product line!

So in other words, when you check the panit may seem as though there is only a little bit of fluid. However, once you remove the pad you seethat all of the fluid is kept away from sight under the initial layer of cotton. The reason this isproblematic is that it interfere with your ability to correctly judge when the pad is actually FULL.And if you misjudge that, the pad will overflow!Typically all other pads you can visible see how much fluid is on it  and can easily determine when itneeds to be changed. But with infinity, while it may hold a lot, it\'s to scary to trust. To get an accurate understanding of how full the pad actually is, you need to look at the back. I think thispad is best used for average flow. and heavy flow should be left to any other pads in their line thatdon\'t use this \'hide the fluid\' technology."

The directions of Front was a nice feature. The fact that they have wrap on the pads helps that you can store them in your purse or desk. There are so many product to choose from and this company has taken the extra step.
278,281,20110925,B003CP15AE,5,"September 25, 2011",A2X3L31KCXBHCL,Best Pads Ever!,"I hate that time of the month. What makes it worse is all the irritating sanitary products.These pads, however, are not irritating at all. They are very thin, soft and comfortable. Moisture is immediately wicked away from your skin and they hold a lot of fluid. I have never ruined a pair of underwear while using these.The Always Infinity pads are sometimes hard to find, so I am glad Amazon carries them now. And, admittedly, they are more expensive than other pads. They\'re so worth it. No pad is softer or more comfortable than these.For super heavy night time use, they also have Always Infinity Overnights which are the only pads that will prevent leakage for me at night during the heavy time of the month.There is no other pad on the market as good as these."

It feels very much like a cotton fabric. The pads are very thin and do provide a fair amount of coverage. The packaging for each pad is very nice. I tried these and found that for my needs they actually make much better pantyliners than pads. If you are having a very heavy period then I would not recommend these, but on lighter days they are nice to have on, so you don\'t have to have a bulky pad on when you just need light protection."

They work well for heavy periods, making you feel dry even after being worn for several hours.  The shape works well and doesn\'t bunch up even when you are active."

They have a weird dot system that did not stay dry upon use.  The box claims each pad lasts for eight hours, but I seriously doubt it unless it is a light day.  I would stick with the regular Always Ultra thins for the price, and the fact I felt drier with my tried and true brand.NOTE: My wife wrote this review.  I did not, as I have no need for this product personally.  :)"

They are very soft and absorbant.  They are very thin and stay in place well.  I\'ve never had to worry about leaks, even on heavy days or overnight.  They cost a little more, but are well worth it."
293,296,20110914,B003CP15AE,5,"September 14, 2011",A2NUBL2UYWPBWR,Absorbs quickly and surface stays dry.,"These pads are thin (only slightly more than a pantyliner) but absorb liquid quickly and the surface stays dry.How did they do this?1) The inner absorbent material is thin but dense and is good at sucking up liquid.2) This inner layer has holes cut into it to create tiny wells for the liquid to pool once it passes through the surface of the pad.  These wells increase the total surface area that liquid is in contact with the absorbent material and so the liquid not only passes through the surface layer faster, but it also gets absorbed faster by the inner material.Overall, this product does exactly what it claims to do.  Highly recommended for those prone to sudden heavy flow and those with minor incontinence. Pricey but worth it."

They always last the longest, have the best absorbency and stay where they\'re supposed to.  These pads are no exception.  What I really love about them is they\'re thin, like a pantiliner.  It\'s the best of both worlds!The texture however, is a little different than the normal pads/pantiliners, but once you get used to it, they\'re just great.  The best part is, they work, just like the Always products always do.Will definitely buy again!"

This particular style was also a little too short if you are looking for extra long ones (and from looking at the other available types, I don\'t see any that are extra long)."

She found the pads to be less bulky and still absorb quite a bit.  The only issue she had with them was that the adhesive didn\'t hold up as well as she hoped and the product tended to move around somewhat.  When asked whether she would purchase said product, she replied that she prefers this brand, but not necessarily this particular product."
311,314,20110826,B003CP15AE,5,"August 26, 2011",A100ZQDV7L8PVV,Improved wing design and better shaped,"These pads are better designed than most, and it is apparent just looking at them.  They are of the thin absorbent variety, which avoids the diaper feeling.  The adhesive sticks well, which is always important.  The new wing design is better shaped to fit the contours of panties than flat wings.  While there are special channels and different shaped openings in the top layer, I am not convinced that the actual effect is significantly different than with other thin absorbent pads. The shape is wider at the back which is good for overnight use.  And while not really significant, the packaging is prettier.  Bottom line, the pads are better designed but I wouldn\'t pay a premium over other pads of this type."

I never was a big fan of Always pads because of that plastic lining that covered the pads. I quit buying them for many years because of that plastic lining. But thankfully THESE pads do not have that. It\'s a nice soft cottony-like covering that is highly absorbent and comfortable, yet feels DRY! These pads have a desirable thickness level; not too thick, not too thin. Just right. They are very long so they are excellent for people who wear them overnight and sleep on their back (as I do). They wear well through the day, and even during very heavy menstruation, I have never had one of these leak. I have become concerned a few times when they kind of bunched up in the middle, but it did not affect their performance at all. These are really great quality and I definitely recommend them."

It is especially good for those of us who experience a fairly heavy flow and for overnight protection. They have a pleasant, light scent and an \'odor-lock\'.  The \'odor- lock\' seemed to work well and I did not feel like I smelled of a perfumy cover-up either.Overall, I would buy these maxi pads again.  They did a good job!"

It is very absorbent.  It has a nice large coverage area.  The light scent is pleasant and not at all overpowering.  But with no wings, it\'s hard to feel confident in this product for heavy-flow days. And it\'s so bulky that at first I thought I\'d been sent some bladder-control pads by mistake. The bottom line -- they weren\'t bad at all, but I can\'t say I plan on buying them again, at least in the near future."

So, after much research, I kept coming back to Aloe Vera Juice. George\'s was recommended for it\'s taste and texture. I\'ve been using it for a month. It took about a good week or so to really kick in, but I haven\'t experienced any heartburn, reflux, etc. I wasn\'t expecting it to work as well as it does. I would recommend this to everyone with any type of digestive issues. It\'s not instantanious, but it is so worth it when it does work. I drink 2 oz in the morning and 2 oz at night.

Then I developed another occasional and very painful inflammation in my eyes which almost blinded me with pain.  Both are autoimmune problems.I have had every treatment conceivable, some with serious side effects.  Trying to address the burning, I drank this product one night,  and had relief by morning.  It has worked everytime.  For ulcersin my mouth,  I swish it around before swallowing. (These are not herpes...don\'t know how it would work for that)It has been used for centuries for burns.  I trust most folk medicine because it has had thousands of human trials and if it didn\'t work, or killed people,  the treatment would not have survived.This product was such a miracle for me, I tried to research it\'s efficacy.  It seems that aloe contains a substance which inhibits the proliferation of mast cells.
