Most of time, it is comfortable to wear it, but you need to change pads often. This pads cannot hold much, and cannot last long. Sometimes it creates itch. Again you have to change pads often (at least once every two hours)."
31,31,20110306,B001GCTTJY,4,"March 6, 2011",A1AR72Y4M1BYBQ,...,Pretty good price for 4 packs. The price is what you pay and they do seem kinda cheap. They work however.

I can use them without worrying about horrible rashes in places I don\'t want rashes to be.My one big complaint though is that it takes longer to process these for shipping than a regular order. seriously people..they\'re a little bag how long can it take to move the little bag from it\'s stack into a box?
38,38,20110605,B001LK6Q6K,5,"June 5, 2011",A1SM5FFHEAAHDQ,great price!,This product came just when expected with Prime Shipping and it was the best price that I\'ve found online or in stores.

41,41,20101126,B001LK6Q92,5,"November 26, 2010",A40ULZ7N0PKXZ,good product,I have been using this brand for long long time but this was the first time that I ordered it online. The shipping is FAST! I got it after I placed the order two or three days after. The overnight Always is incredible. It is very long but you will still feel very comfortable since it is very thin. It gives you 100% protection at night and even day time. The price is very reasonable as well. I usually buy it online but now I am considering to get it from this website. Great product.

Invicible and absurbing - I used them right after I had a baby and it held pretty good. A year later - still using them - not for heavy period of course, just every day."
46,46,20110716,B001LK6QJW,1,"July 16, 2011",A2XD6KQB1A407W,Great if you have perfectly predictable periods,"I tried these liners and initially liked them since they are so very thin and comfortable. Unfortunately, wearing them on the last couple days of my period during some very light spotting was a huge mistake. I had a sudden, unexpected increase in spotting amounting to less than a teaspoon and they leaked through the bottom, ruining my panties and jeans! They\'re probably fine if you just want to wear them in between periods, but the U by Kotex liners are just as comfy and actually have a waterproof base."
48,48,20110208,B001LK6QJW,5,"February 8, 2011",A2IEK7OUWM4NJQ,Always Pantliner Thin (Unscented),"Hi,These are tiny and barely noticeable. I love them. What I do for my light days is overlap them to make a wide, yet very thin pantiliner. Works like a charm! And it will not leak if you stretch you panties flat while overlapping them. I promise they are not a waste and they will save your panties! I love them b/c I can\'t feel them at all, even with 2 overlapping!And only buy the unscented- the scented one smells like you are on your period! I have been using this for over a year and never had a leaking issue!"

56,56,20090514,B001LK6QJW,3,"May 14, 2009",ALNFHVS3SC4FV,Not For That Time of The Month,"The Always Thin pantiliners are a small, paper-thin liner that you won\'t even know that you are wearing. It\'s like the Carefree Breathables in that it doesn\'t have a plastic backing. If you are wanting a liner to keep you and your underware fresh on non-period days then this is a great liner.If you are wanting to use on days that you might just be spotting or as tampon backup, then this liner is not for you.I used one after my period was over, just in case, and sure enough, I spotted. It ruined my underware. It didn\'t leak off the sides but just soaked through.Just beware, these are just for refreshment only, not for that time of the month."
57,57,20120202,B001LK6XG8,1,"February 2, 2012",A3HRKDM9S54FAO,Hate These!,"The only positive thing I can say about these is they are long.  They are not soft like most pantiliners I\'ve used, but are very stiff.  They are extremely wide.  So wide, in fact, they  tend to curl under along the edges as they are worn.  I ordered through the subscribe and save program. Should have tried them first.  I will definitely be canceling that subscription."
58,58,20110929,B001LK6XG8,5,"September 29, 2011",A1GCOURMTPXKWI,Perfect liner,"I like these so much, that I am signed up for regular delivery.  They are definitely much larger (width and length) than any liners I have ever used, and they are very absorbent, so you continue to feel fresh.  I hope they never stop making them."
59,59,20110829,B001LK6XG8,1,"August 29, 2011",AHILADYPCTEJF,Two boxes contained defective products!!!,Two of the three boxes contained defective products. The liners were cut down the middle and tore easily while wearing. VERY UNHAPPY!
61,61,20110529,B001LK6XG8,5,"May 29, 2011",ABRXECAO6NKBM,More Alternatives for Plus Sizes,"I know it must seem corny to be writing a review of a pantyliner, but for this, I simply must!I have spent a lifetime being overweight and \'Plus Size\'. Many years ago, I found pads by Always that were geared for women who wear sizes 14 and up -- and have since had difficulty being able to consistently find them.The difference is that the pads for sizes 14 and up are longer and offer more protection. I found that Overnight pads are about the same length, and can be helpful in a pinch. But this review is not about the pads.Over the last few years, I have been fortunate enough to lose some weight, and with it, find myself with a generally lighter flow. Pads can get costly, especially when they are barely used, and I found the Always Pantyliners, which did me decently well.The last time I needed pads and liners, I found myself (newly unemployed) in sticker-shock at the drugstore. Sometimes, I guess we forget just how much the odds and ends cost when we\'re not thinking about money. So I came to Amazon, and in looking for my products, found the Always Pantyliner - made for sizes 14 and up. I did not know this existed, but I quickly decided to go ahead and make the purchase in liu of the regular pantyliner.The size is slightly longer and wider, and I am so much more comfortable that there is more coverage. I\'m glad Always has taken larger women into consideration, and every plus size woman should know that there is a product out there to protect her, too!"
63,63,20100911,B001LK6XG8,5,"September 11, 2010",A1B4HIS7NDR861,n/a,"Can\'t find them in stores around here.  Work great.....Love the longer length.  Again, something you can\'t find.  Was Delivered quickly."
67,67,20100325,B00284B4PQ,5,"March 25, 2010",A358D87VUQT72,Great Product,these are the best idea yet.  They fit regular panties and thong...plus they are the perfect thickness for everyday wear and those awful leaks.  So flexible you forget you\'re wearing one.
68,68,20111218,B00284B58M,5,"December 18, 2011",A3TKUFBYNY8SBW,Best Brand,"Alaways is the best brand on the market and my daughters just love them. It\'s not much really say other than that this brand is very, very reliable and comfortable. My daughters and I highly recommend this brand to other young teen girls and women. You can find this product for a great buy on Amazon."

71,71,20120301,B0029NYPUC,5,"March 1, 2012",AOB9IYQVOA76U,this pad is \'growing\' with me.,"I am now 24, and am basically the same size I was in high school (smaller, actually). The design/doodles on the packaging seem to market these pads towards teens/smaller girls who are just starting their periods. I am a size 4-6, and these pads fit really well in my panties. I wear normal bikini/hiphugger panties that cannot seem to \'fit\' standard thin pads, with or without wings. This is the first pad where I actually was able to use the wings simply to secure and hold the pad in place...as opposed to normal/larger pads, with which I tend to use the wings as a \'belt\' to strap the pad into place, so that the wings significantly overlap on the outside of the panty material. really annoying, uncomfortable, and does not offer much leak protection. These slender pads are great - they do not seem to wick away moisture as well as some other pads with a cotton-y surface that remains dry while pulling moisture into the \'core\' of the pad. in fact, the \'mesh,\' surface layer of these pads seems to pull away from the bottom/stick part of the pad if they are too saturated. however, obviously, if your flow is that heavy, you should be changing your pad more often...lady life lessons!bottom-line though, there is no fault of these pads that outweigh the advantage of the appropriate size and \'stay-in-place\' fit. I hope to find them in other sizes/absorbencies, but for now, these are my go-to pads. GREAT price on amazon, these are often hard to find in my local stores and even with the regular P&G coupons, the price is better (with no trip to the store!) from amazon. couldn\'t be more pleased."
76,76,20110517,B0029NYPUC,5,"May 17, 2011",A3SP7Q41PG4ZGP,Excellent for teenagers or petite frames,My teenage daughter really loves these.  She is very thin and has a very narrow frame.  Basically she\'s 5\' 5\' and a size 0.  She didn\'t like the standard Always Ultra Thins because she felt they were too wide.  I was thrilled to have found these on Amazon.com.  They work very well for her.

Does what it\'s suppose to do and its a GREAT deal for the price. I ran out and decided to look on amazon to see if I can get it at a good price and yes I did. I keep a few in My purse at all times.  Good product if you want that fresh feeling at all times.
80,80,20110818,B0029NYPXO,5,"August 18, 2011",A3JCLYDBPZI9S,Great Product,"Thin and easy to take with me. The fragrance is not too strong, and the cloth is gentle but effective."
85,85,20120413,B0029NYPY8,5,"April 13, 2012",A14KEL9HPHMIRI,TMI,A friend recommended these to me over 5 years ago for my delicate tushy.  They are perfect. I don\'t use toilet paper on my bum anymore. I always have a couple in my purse for public toilets.  They flush just fine. I don\'t know about septic systems though.

I keep them on the back of the toilet and use them as a way to quickly freshen up, or for clean up...after... :o)  My boyfriend even uses them for himself.  I won\'t go without having wipes in the bathroom anymore.  I\'m not a huge fan of the scent, but oh well."
91,91,20101206,B0029NYPY8,5,"December 6, 2010",AL77KF4YQVL78,Fresh and Clean,"Always Feminine Wipes are one of my favorite luxuries. Even the softest toilet paper doesn\'t compare to how gently this cleans and refreshes. I prefer Always to other brands because some of the others would dry up and others seemed soggy so, after using it, I had to crouch there for a while to air dry before pulling up my panties. Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient."

The container is good because it helps to preserve the liquid in the wipes without drying out. I use these quite often when I need to feel fresh after using the bathroom. Because i like it so much, I bought the To Go ones as well.For anyone who is worried about possible infections, that was my original worry at first, but I\'ve had no problem at all.I would definitely recommend this to anyone."

Our grocery store was was out of overnight regulars, but had the infinity.  I had seen it advertised on TV and thought whoo hoo a slender reliable product, NOT! I will Never buys these again!"
108,108,20111026,B0029NYQ1K,5,"October 26, 2011",A2ZTGDUXSTH50G,LOVE them!,"These pads are amazing! One thing I\'ve always hated about pads is that weird rubbery plasticky feeling they had. These are slim and almost feel like cotton (well, for a pad that is). But really I love them because they seriously absorb everything. The other pads wouldn\'t really absorb everything, making me feel gross and unhygienic. And I\'m not even talking about after leaving the pad on for that long. These pads, I\'m guessing with the help of the \'tunnels,\' absorb everything so it\'s all at the bottom of the pad, away from the body. From now on, these are always my pad of choice."
114,114,20101203,B0029NYQ1K,5,"December 3, 2010",A9SI2I8F0LB2Z,These are amazing.,"Really.  They\'re incredible.  They absorb thoroughly and almost instantaneously, hold a lot, and are very thin, very soft, and very flexible."
118,118,20120221,B0029NYQ2E,2,"February 21, 2012",ANDSFDPKUQ1Q4,Not absorbent enough for me!,"Seems like mixed reviews for this, so I thought I should put my 2 cents in to add to the confusion. I was impressed with the quality of the pad; definitely explains why it cost more. Its actually quite thin compared to other pads that claim \'heavy absorbency\' , and the texture/density reminds me of  a makeup applicator sponge. The double wings was a good idea, but like some of the reviewers have mentioned- it did not seems to stick as well to certain underwear, and if it can\'t be relied on to stick well on EVERY underwear in your drawer, well- the reliability issue is moot already! And reliability is important if your are out and about, in and out of chairs, meeting with people constantly, and can\'t always run to the restroom when you feel that doomsday leakage- b/c then,  please don\'t rely on this pad.  When I have a heavy day- its heavy like Niagara Falls heavy where it feels like 1/2 pint just unleashes in one split second (sorry for the graphics, but I\'m trying to make a point, and those who have my type of heavy will know exactly what I mean), and this little fella just did not do it for me on a busy day when I don\'t have a restroom to run to. The absorbency rate on this high-tech pad is TOO SLOW for my type of \'Unleash thy furry\' Heavy days, and it just seemed to spill over the side like a shallow raft that can not contain its occupants (while going over the edge of Niagara Falls).  Every time I wore it on a heavy day, my underwear was dirtied to the extent where an extra pair of underwear was necessary! Does it sound gross? Yes- it was.  It you want to avoid grossness, do avoid this pad!  I saved the pad for my guaranteed light days and was able to finish my high tech pads in that manner, but I would not buy this again. Too bad- it does look and feel promising.  Hope my frank and honest review helps out any undecided non-tampon users."
122,122,20111109,B0029NYQ2E,5,"November 9, 2011",A38AHVJOFWP1ZX,Very Comfortable!,"I was skeptical (remembering those original plastic Always pads), but I got a free sample of these.  What a difference!  The pad is thin, yet very absorbent.  The wings are perfect, and the material is the softest that I have ever come in contact with. I have many skin allergies, but this product doesn\'t cause a reaction.  I\'m hooked!"
128,128,20110917,B0029NYQ2E,5,"September 17, 2011",AWNQ2PULUBHDH,Amazing and worth trying!,"I can\'t believe I\'m actually writing a review for this, but I\'ve used Always Infinity for about a year now and I have to admit that I actually stock up on these pads.  I\'m really sorry that others haven\'t had the good results I have, but I can\'t help wondering if they didn\'t read the **UNSCENTED** description or what.For the convenience and absorbency of these pads, they can\'t be beat (trust me, I\'ve tried them all for almost 3 decades now)!  These are made from what I can only describe as a \'Dr. Scholl\'s-like\' material.  The pad is VERY comfortable and definitely breathes.  If you\'re an active female, or have an extremely heavy flow, then you should definitely be conscious of having to change out the pad throughout the day.  These Infinity pads are SUPER absorbent - what\'s seen on the surface of the pad is only about 1/3 of what\'s actually being held.  So please keep that in mind.  I normally have a heavy flow and sometimes had issues at night (I sleep on my belly) and that was always a big problem during \'my time\' when the pad I\'d use would leak.  Not at all the case with these!Always Infinity DOES tend to cost more than other brands, but if you keep an eye out (as I do) you can find a decent in-store sale.  For the convenience of having these delivered, the Amazon price is on-par with what these are retailing for."

It\'s a lot cheaper to buy them in person (obviously)2. It doesn\'t look like what I thought it would... it just looks like a regular pad but with holes in them.I\'m hoping that it will at least work as good as the company says it will.

It was so hard not to prevent leaks with other pads. I would have to change my pad every 2 hours to prevent leaking . I loved always pads so I decided to see what all the commotion with always infinity was about. The pads are super absorbent and I can get more than 4 hours with it (which has never happened!). The pad can hold a lot of liquid. I would recommend this for anyone with heavy periods, who doesn\'t like to always wear tampons, but still has an active lifestyle!"
139,139,20091023,B0029NYQ2E,5,"October 23, 2009",A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,Always does it again!,"When it comes to feminine products, only the best will do. I was a user of Always Ultrathin with Wings before. These came as a sample in one of those packages. What an excellent marketing ploy. I did not think they could improve Always Ultrathins but they have.COMFORTAlways Infinity are oh so soft, thin and dry. Compared to Ultrathins, Inifinity feels more like tissue paper. They keep me drier than Ultrathins by somehow drawing the moisture away from me. With Ultrathins I feel dry. With these, I feel drier. I feel like I don\'t have any pads on.PROTECTIONI will not buy pads without wings. Always Infinity has double wings. Not sure if the double wings are actually better than single wings, but wings are wings and they do protect the sides of the panties just like the Ultrathin with Wings do.The back of the overnight Infinity is longer and wider than the front of the pad for that leakage that seeps backwards. So far, I have not had any accidents. The Infinity regular size, of course, doesn\'t have this added length in the back. I find the regular size adequate for daytime protection.Always Infinity are the most absorbant pads I\'ve ever used. Don\'t know what technology they have, but he moisture is pulled away from me and locked inside. When I change them, I feel they could still absorb so much more. With Ultrathins, I usually think they are at the end of their life.PROS:+wings+thin+keeps moisture away+most absorbant+soft and comfortable+overnights are longer and wider in backCONS:-NONE! Don\'t know how they\'ll improve these!SUMMARYAt the risk of sounding like I work for the company (I don\'t have any ties, trust me), try these. You\'ll be a convert.UPDATE:  Yes, I\'ve been using these ever since I\'ve been introduced to them.  The different lengths correspond exactly to what I need -- regular, heavy and overnight.  There\'s even a little note on each one telling me which side goes forward.  Still haven\'t found any cons."

This time around I decided on trying Infinity based on the description and a sale at the grocery store.  I was amazed.  They are thin, the top stays pretty much dry/a bit damp, and they absorb a lot.  Of course, each woman\'s body is different so this may not be the same for you.I travel and live a lot in countries where I may not be able to make it to a washroom to change my pad for quite some time, and these have held up immensely.

Heavy and extra heavy pads were never absorbent enough. The similar sized (i.e. extra thick) pads would not stay fitted properly and caused leaks. The thicker pads I tried also twisted around to adhesive side up which was both very uncomfortable and caused them to not absorb correctly, so was also messy. I am concerned about toxic shock syndrome so I do not use tampons. I tried every brand of \'overnight\' or \'extra heavy\' pads out there at the time and none of them were up to it. I found these about three years ago and have not tried another heavy flow overnight pad since.With these Always brand Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings I never have to use more than one at a time. I\'ve never had leaks when using these pads and I don\'t have problems with them twisting around to adhesive side up. If you have extremely heavy menstrual flow then you should try these pads.It is true that they are extremely long and very thick. The pad length is such that some cuts of underwear will be too small (or short) in the back if you place the pad correctly. This causes the pad to overhang or stick out of the back of the underwear. This is remedied easily, but can be inconvenient. If this is something that you cannot stand then you should not get these pads.Regarding price, currently Amazon is offering a two pack for about 12 dollars. I\'ve seen big differences in price depending on where you get them (between 12 -20 for one pack)this is the lowest price I have seen so far (about 6 dollars for one pack)."

I like the other Always that comes in the orangy peach wrapper , not as thick and long as the Maxi Overnites but they work (well for me at least)I do like the fact that Always took the time out to construct a heftier napkin.

Finally tired of wearing an overnight level absorbancy pad and a tampon just to be on the safe side, I decided to find another option. I saw a package of Always Overnight Extra Heavy Flow Maxi pads at my local Wal-Mart, and I thought it wouldn\'t hurt to try them out. W-o-w. First of all, this is a VERY long pad. It is about the length of two Always Ultra-Thin Overnight pads stuck together, and it pretty much expands from the top of my underwear to the back of them. Another helpful feature is that this pad contains two sets of wings--one in the middle like traditional pads and another set at the back. While, these pads DEFINITELY prevent leaks, I have a few complaints about this product. First of all, I\'ve noticed that when you remove the pad, it leaves a thin adhesive strip on your underwear that is hard to remove. So, though these pads keep you from having accidents, I still do not recommend that you wear your good underwear while using them.  Also, it is pretty hard to descreetly carry these in your purse, as they are VERY large. But other than that, I feel that they are an amazing product. Surprisingly, these pads don\'t feel like a diaper when I am wearing them, so that is a plus. However, I feel that women who are any smaller than a size twelve or fourteen might find them to be quite bulky, so I would take that into consideration. Also, if you are a woman who is already sticking two maximum coverage pads together just to feel comfortable, this maxi pad has about the same effect, so it will not be anything new to you. But overall, I will purchase these in the future."

First, I do not like scented pads and this is unscented, which is good. What is bad is that it doesn\'t seem to have any baking soda or odor absorbers. Maybe it does and it\'s just not working, but I\'ve never experienced such a smelly pad in such a quick amount of time. When the menstrual blood hits the air it produces a smell and we all know it. You need something to counteract that smell and these pads seem to do nothing for that. You\'d better be changing these pads half-hourly if you want to avoid the period smell. I would not wear this type of pad outside the home due to my insecurities about the lack of smell protection and the need to change them so frequently (due to smell) which is inconvenient.

Only someone who doesn\'t have a heavy flow would think these are bulky.  This is more comfortable than the comparable maxis that also make sure you don\'t have accidents.- Odor control is good, barely discernable (if you don\'t notice any odor, it\'s all good!)- Wide, so even without wings you don\'t get accidents.I\'ve had no accidents with these, and they\'re even good when you come home from the hospital after having a baby and don\'t want to use the monster-sized pads they give you."

It is very absorbent.  It has a nice large coverage area.  The light scent is pleasant and not at all overpowering.  But with no wings, it\'s hard to feel confident in this product for heavy-flow days. And it\'s so bulky that at first I thought I\'d been sent some bladder-control pads by mistake. The bottom line -- they weren\'t bad at all, but I can\'t say I plan on buying them again, at least in the near future."

If you suffer from accidents just like me (for example the bedsheets have blood where I was laying on because I was dripping from the back of my underwear), then this product is for you. I will almost always suffer from this accident, but because the product was long, it covered almost to the back of my panty preventing this from happening. I can\'t really comment on the odor-lock but from what I can tell, it smell a bit less I would guess. But again, I don\'t go out of my way to check if one pad is smellier after use than another since flows vary every menstrual cycle.This product is good if you are accident-prone (you leak from the back when you are sitting because of a heavy flow)"

I found this to be a huge plus, especially when worn overnight.  No chafing or irritation, even when worn while working out for about an hour.- Reliability: No leaks or staining even with heavy flow.  The channels on the pad help to lock in flow plus I found the pad stays in place very well, especially for a pad without wings.- Thickness: Here\'s where these pads lose some points.  A fellow reviewer compared these to a baby\'s diaper - I agree these are quite thick but willing to accept that for the positive factors above.  For overnight use the thickness of this pad isn\'t too big of a deal, but I wouldn\'t recommend wearing this pad under very tight fitting clothing (then again, maybe tight fitting clothes aren\'t such a good idea for the days you need a super maxi!)"

What\'s missing is the wings, I have to agree with other reviewers.  Also, it\'s really thick, in fact, thicker than baby\'s diapers!  I suppose \'super\' is supposed to be thicker, but without wings, they tend to move around (or up in this case)."

Generally, I go for pads that are long and have wings. These particular pads are not the kind I usually go for but I decided to give them a shot. I was actually pleasantly surprised with these!Let\'s talk about the positives first. I generally can\'t go through a period without ruining at least one pair of underwear. I can say that with these, I didn\'t soil my underwear at all. Not even one drop. Also, I\'ve found that pads that don\'t have wings tend to move around a bit but these stayed firmly in place.Now for a couple of negatives. First, as I said above, I like pads with wings. When I wear pads without wings, I\'m always afraid that the pad is going to shift and I\'m going to bleed right through my pants. Although I didn\'t have a problem with these pads, I wish they had wings just for the peace of mind. Second, I don\'t think the light scent did anything to control the odor.Overall, these work pretty well in absorbing and staying put. Although I generally don\'t go for these kinds of pads, it did what it was supposed to do."

I often get what the chinese call \'Liver Yang Rising\', which results in a lot of hot tempered conditions.  Aloe Vera is very Yin tonifying, and it\'s always brought me great balance.  I love it.I was in the Vitamin Store, and saw this George\'s aloe.  I always buy the Lily of the Desert stuff, but this caught my eye, and I bought it. The price was similar in comparison.  I thought, what the heck, I\'ll give it a try.I\'m about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, and I now realize that I notice NONE of the beneficial Yin tonifying effects that traditional Aloe Vera Juice gives you.  Pretty much none whatsoever.  This Aloe tastes like distilled water.  Has no taste whatsoever.  A good part of Aloe\'s medicine is in the bitter.  All medicines in nature have a bitter tasting element to them.  Bitter is healing.  When you remove the bitter, I\'m not so sure it\'s healing anymore.I was reading through the testiominals on here, and they all seem stomach related.  Perhaps it has a beneficial effect on stomach woes, but since I don\'t have any, it did nothing for me.  It had no effect on my Liver Yang Rising, and I feel like the cooling, Yin tonifying effects just aren\'t there with this aloe.Not a big deal, wasted some money, but I\'m going right back to Lily of the Desert."

So, after much research, I kept coming back to Aloe Vera Juice. George\'s was recommended for it\'s taste and texture. I\'ve been using it for a month. It took about a good week or so to really kick in, but I haven\'t experienced any heartburn, reflux, etc. I wasn\'t expecting it to work as well as it does. I would recommend this to everyone with any type of digestive issues. It\'s not instantanious, but it is so worth it when it does work. I drink 2 oz in the morning and 2 oz at night. It has the exact same feel, taste and texture as water. I have a real issue with taste and texture and this didn\'t bother me at all!!!! I\'ll keep you posted if there are any changes, good or bad."

They aggravated all my symptoms and made them worse.  I was in a supplement store and the clerk recommended aloe vera to which I said \'No way, I tried it already\'.  He said \'Oh, you tried the other stuff.  Let me introduce you to George\'s\'.My life improved dramatically almost immediately.  All the symptoms disappeared or diminished.  I even tried going off the stuff after a week and the symptoms returned.  Since then I keep a couple of gallons around all the time.  If I forget to use it my body lets me know in 3 or 4 days and I go back on it.  I only have to drink 1 or 2 ounces a day.These people who are saying this is water or that it doesn\'t work are suspect as far as I am concerned.  Do they work for the competition?  Do they have a beef with George\'s?  Did they take it correctly?  What else are they taking or eating and drinking?  Do they think the FDA would let George\'s get away with selling water?  You know how much the FDA would love to put the supplement business out of business!

I have not been able to go one day without taking Nexium until I started drinking George\'s Aloe. A friend of mine heard about George\'s Aloe from her holistic pharmacist. George\'s Aloe has no taste or texture - it\'s like drinking water. I drink about 2 oz. every other day - the days I don\'t take Nexium.Another side benefit is that my hair is thicker. My beautician noticed that my hair wasn\'t falling out like it used to, and we attributed it to George\'s Aloe.One of the reasons I decided aloe might work for me is because when I was visiting St. John, USVI, I went on an island tour.

I trust most folk medicine because it has had thousands of human trials and if it didn\'t work, or killed people,  the treatment would not have survived.This product was such a miracle for me, I tried to research it\'s efficacy.  It seems that aloe contains a substance which inhibits the proliferation of mast cells.  Mast cells are what triggers the production of histamines which results in the inflammatory response.I like George\'s because the others have preservatives, can cause diarhrea and have a bad taste.
