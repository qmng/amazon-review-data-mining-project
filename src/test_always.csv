I\'m either switching brands or switching suppliers. These are great pads, but not worth the HUGE price increase, which is significantly more than I would pay in the store."

Most of time, it is comfortable to wear it, but you need to change pads often. This pads cannot hold much, and cannot last long. Sometimes it creates itch. Again you have to change pads often (at least once every two hours)."

For the service of being delivered right to my door I would purchase these again.  But if I do go into the stores, Walmart has these for a cheaper price.  The service was great though because these were shipped to me immediately."

Specially when she got out of bed.These are so good she no longer has to put anything on the bed to protect it from overnight leaks or run to the bathroom when she stood up in the morning.Simply the best!

The description says \'Larger than our regular pad for overnight protection\' - I am scared to know how small their \'regular pad\' is, if this this considered the large size.I just spent $10.32 on them but I will have to go out to get some normal sizes. Don\'t waste your money!!!"

I just bought the Always dri-liners with OdorLock and don\'t like them.  The thin top layer doesn\'t stay put and bunches up, unlike the regular +14 panty liners, without the thin top odor layer.  The store where I usually purchase them had only the ones with OdorLock so that is why I bought them.  I will go back to the +14 panty liners if I can find them."

I keep them on the back of the toilet and use them as a way to quickly freshen up, or for clean up...after... :o)  My boyfriend even uses them for himself.  I won\'t go without having wipes in the bathroom anymore.  I\'m not a huge fan of the scent, but oh well."

Best of all, at 8.66 for a pack of FOUR tubs this is an epic value since at your local drugstore they run at 4.79 for just ONE tub. I\'m glad I was able to find these here."
100,100,20101206,B0029NYPZ2,5,"December 6, 2010",AL77KF4YQVL78,Fresh and Clean,"Always Feminine Wipes are one of my favorite luxuries. Even the softest toilet paper doesn\'t compare to how gently this cleans and refreshes. I prefer Always to other brands because some of the others would dry up and others seemed soggy so, after using it, I had to crouch there for a while to air dry before pulling up my panties. Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient.The tub isn\'t too tacky looking and fits the wipes perfectly. It also keeps them from drying out. Once in awhile I\'ll accidentally pull out two wipes from the plastic sleeve, which is like facial tissue nearly impossible to get back in and never worth the effort. I\'ll lay the wipe on top of the pack and it will still be moist the next time I open the tub to use it."
102,102,20120326,B0029NYQ1K,5,"March 26, 2012",AES4FWKNAHZYJ,These are wonderful,"I hate my time of the month. Who doesn\'t? But these pads are great for the entire time. They\'re very long, so they prevent leaks quite well. They\'re great for overnight or for the daytime. They\'re very thin, so it doesn\'t feel like you\'re wearing a diaper all day. And they are very absorbent, and they do wick moisture away from your body very quickly. I don\'t have to worry with these. This is a great product at a great price, and with the subscribe and save, it\'s an ever better deal. And it\'s not like you won\'t go through them."

Product arrived in a timely fashion and as described.  This product, IMHO is the best overnite protection available.  Nothing I\'ve ever used before these worked as well, absorbed as much or was easy on my skin as these. Would buy again and again."
110,110,20111024,B0029NYQ1K,1,"October 24, 2011",A29PSJ1U7QBZEL,Worst Pad I\'ve Ever Used,"These are, by far, the worst pad I\'ve ever used. I\'ve used them for two months and have found them to be non-obsorbent. They\'re also too slender, except in the back. I can\'t count how many accidents I\'ve had while wearing them. I would never buy them again. I\'m sticking with Always Ultra Thins and the regular thick pad in the blue bag."
111,111,20110806,B0029NYQ1K,5,"August 6, 2011",AMVXFVCSB80JP,Great product!,Always Infinity has always been a very trustworthy product for every woman. Never puts you in an embarrassing situation. Great product and this amazon deal is super.
112,112,20110619,B0029NYQ1K,5,"June 19, 2011",A3ATCOLQQ6FOGT,Best even for heavier flows...,"I have very heavy flows... yes, I have to use two at once (one behind the other), but I\'ve had to do that with every other pad I\'ve ever tried. And with these you don\'t feel gross, you\'re extremely comfortable, and they do absorb a lot more than the others. I still leak, but not as much. They\'re definitely not perfect, the wings are a bit too short and the pad itself isn\'t as wide as I\'d like, but I give it 5 stars because it\'s still the best pad on the market."
115,115,20101118,B0029NYQ1K,5,"November 18, 2010",A3MB95ZAZ3BTQH,May be the best sanitary napkins out there!,"From the time these were launched in the market I have not been able to use anything else.They are highly absorbent and very thin. I dont feel like I am wearing it and does not give that wet feeling at all. I would highly recommend them. Amazon has a great price as well, specially combined with subscribe and save."
118,118,20120221,B0029NYQ2E,2,"February 21, 2012",ANDSFDPKUQ1Q4,Not absorbent enough for me!,"Seems like mixed reviews for this, so I thought I should put my 2 cents in to add to the confusion. I was impressed with the quality of the pad; definitely explains why it cost more. Its actually quite thin compared to other pads that claim \'heavy absorbency\' , and the texture/density reminds me of  a makeup applicator sponge. The double wings was a good idea, but like some of the reviewers have mentioned- it did not seems to stick as well to certain underwear, and if it can\'t be relied on to stick well on EVERY underwear in your drawer, well- the reliability issue is moot already! And reliability is important if your are out and about, in and out of chairs, meeting with people constantly, and can\'t always run to the restroom when you feel that doomsday leakage- b/c then,  please don\'t rely on this pad.  When I have a heavy day- its heavy like Niagara Falls heavy where it feels like 1/2 pint just unleashes in one split second (sorry for the graphics, but I\'m trying to make a point, and those who have my type of heavy will know exactly what I mean), and this little fella just did not do it for me on a busy day when I don\'t have a restroom to run to. The absorbency rate on this high-tech pad is TOO SLOW for my type of \'Unleash thy furry\' Heavy days, and it just seemed to spill over the side like a shallow raft that can not contain its occupants (while going over the edge of Niagara Falls).  Every time I wore it on a heavy day, my underwear was dirtied to the extent where an extra pair of underwear was necessary! Does it sound gross? Yes- it was.  It you want to avoid grossness, do avoid this pad!  I saved the pad for my guaranteed light days and was able to finish my high tech pads in that manner, but I would not buy this again. Too bad- it does look and feel promising.  Hope my frank and honest review helps out any undecided non-tampon users."
124,124,20111103,B0029NYQ2E,2,"November 3, 2011",A37XHG5LLONQH2,"no comfortable, too thick",It is too thick and I fell quite uncomfortable with it.It is my mistake to choose this one. It may suit for someone who sit all day.
127,127,20110925,B0029NYQ2E,5,"September 25, 2011",A3AGVZC564PM6D,i can never go back,"i thought these were just expensive versions of the regular Always pads, but i was so wrong. whatever sponge thing they use in these is kind of magical. you feel so dry like you\'re wearing regular underwear and they can take in a lot. it\'s almost like it\'s sucking it out of me. i don\'t think i can ever go back. i almost look forward to using them. ALMOST."

It\'s a lot cheaper to buy them in person (obviously)2. It doesn\'t look like what I thought it would... it just looks like a regular pad but with holes in them.I\'m hoping that it will at least work as good as the company says it will.

Even though they are expensive I always luck up on a coupon when I need more. Now that i have found these on amazon I will start buying them from here instead of from the store. Since if I buy these in the store I would be paying $14.00 for two boxes. Great save, great deal, great product."
131,131,20110806,B0029NYQ2E,5,"August 6, 2011",AWKKF1MOSV5SL,amazingly absorbent!,"I\'ve had my period since I was very young and I have always had a heavy flow. It was so hard not to prevent leaks with other pads. I would have to change my pad every 2 hours to prevent leaking . I loved always pads so I decided to see what all the commotion with always infinity was about. The pads are super absorbent and I can get more than 4 hours with it (which has never happened!). The pad can hold a lot of liquid. I would recommend this for anyone with heavy periods, who doesn\'t like to always wear tampons, but still has an active lifestyle!"
137,137,20100515,B0029NYQ2E,5,"May 15, 2010",A2PPKOUDNFPD3,Shocked!,"I got a free sample of this to try, thinking it would be like any other Always pad (which is my favorite brand, after all), but boy was I wrong! When I first opened it, I was confused. I\'d never seen anything like it. It was so strangely light and yet didn\'t seem like it should be. The material made me think of memory foam, only super soft textured.With how thin it was at the top, I didn\'t think it would be impressive for my flow (I have endometriosis, so that means I always have to wear overnight or better, maximum protection pads to keep up with my super flow, sometimes in addition to a tampon, which I hate wearing). Well, it worked great and it really felt like I didn\'t have anything on.I decided to actually buy the product this period to see if it was just a fluke and put it to the test immediately with my worst time--overnight on my heaviest night. When even the best pads have failed me in the past.Not a drop off the pad. The wings held and only in one place did it even leave the center of the top (the entire bottom was filled). And I felt DRY. If I hadn\'t seen the bottom, I\'d have thought maybe there was no flow overnight.I tried another today and got that familiar \'overproducing\' feeling that always leads to pad failure. I went to the bathroom, expecting a mess and the pad had contained it completely. It hadn\'t approached any edges. I was shocked and amazed. I\'ve never had a pad work this well, in 15 years of super-heavy periods, that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage.What\'s more, I almost always get irritation on this day in my cycle. Nada. I am SOLD.So, to recap: it held more than any other pad I\'ve seen that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage. It left NO irritation on a heavy day. It worked overnight on my worst night. And I feel dry--it absorbs faster than anything I\'ve ever worn. I\'ve never felt compelled to review a product as strongly as this before, lol. Probably hormones ;)"
141,141,20120302,B0029NYQ38,5,"March 2, 2012",A1EK6S0MGC702M,My best friend,"I\'m surprised that I am writing a review for pads, but here it goes. This pad is literally my best friend. I don\'t even know what I would do without it. Ever since I switched to using the Infinity, I have seriously not been able to go back to anything else. At a certain level, this is almost a problem. I was staying at my sister\'s for a few days when I got my period unexpectedly, and she doesn\'t use these. So, when I had to use her regular pads, I was in hell for a day and half until I could go buy some of the Infinity pads. But, lesson learned. I stash one or two in every place I can in case of emergencies (ex: travel bags, different purses, cosmetics bag, you name it) so I never have to stress out again. It is just so comfortable, I sometimes forget that I\'m on my period and wearing a pad (leading to a danger of remembering to change). If women out there have not used these yet, I cannot urge you enough to switch to the Always Infinity. It honestly is a miracle for women using pads. I was explaining to a friend how much I like these and used the phrase, \'Magic Pad.\' Seriously, it is. You may laugh but I don\'t think I can EVER use anything else."

147,147,20111102,B0029NYQ38,5,"November 2, 2011",A3S15YGZ6W6EV2,Better than any alternative that I\'ve found.,"I found these pads to be the best option for \'stuff\', by far. They are soft, absorbent, and are superb at keeping me clean and fresh. They cost a bit more than other alternatives, although I think it\'s well worth the confidence I have, knowing that I\'ll never have a problem when I use these.One gotcha:  Keep quiet if you bring a box of these to work and keep them in your desk. Less-prepared co-workers will beg, borrow and (usually) steal them once they discover how well they work.  This brings up the cost per use (for you) up by a whole lot.  I suggest hiding the contents of the box in an old Pampers wrapper.  This will keep all your co-workers far away from your \'stuff.\'"

I LOVE THESE.They are so comfortable that you will forget they are there. The shape is unique and REALLY fits. You gals know what I\'m talking about when I say the regular pads always bunch up. These just don\'t.These puppies also do NOT stick to you. That\'s another thing that some pads do -these have not stuck once. They are plenty absorbent with absolutely no leakage at all.Once I went to these I just could not go back to any other type. I tried. I really did. In the end I put the other pads in the closet for emergencies and these front and center for monthly use. Highly recommended!

I just thought that I was going to be stuck changing my sheets and morning messes for the rest of my period life. When I first tried these I was like these are really long but they really really work. I have no more messes and everything is caught by the pad. I told my friend about them and she laughed at me when I told her how long they were and how they had like 4 wings. I let her try one and she now buys them. I am so glad I found them here so now I can buy more at one time for a cheaper price.
161,161,20111231,B0029NYQ6A,5,"December 31, 2011",A2AWZ10ZWPJUXC,Always Maxi Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings,No matter what brand of pads I buy I come back to Always. These pads do protect overnight and you can sleep instead of making all those trips to the bathroom at night. If you have a problem with super extra heavy flow nothing is going to work but if not use these. I like the added feature of wings as they provide extra protection. The adhesive strip is really strong and they won\'t slip. I wouldn\'t buy any other pad but Always as they\'re reliable and top quality. You can\'t get any better. It\'s worth it.
162,162,20111226,B0029NYQ6A,5,"December 26, 2011",A3VMJODZYCAKN9,Did the job,"I bought these while pregnant to be used after giving birth. These were so much better than the pads they give you at the hospital and work really well. I didn\'t have any leaks and didn\'t have to change constantly.  I don\'t know if I will be using for regular use, but for really heavy flow they worked so that I could just concentrate on my new baby."
171,171,20110930,B0029NYQ6A,5,"September 30, 2011",A2FV5YQV866PVF,Excellent Overnight Protection,"This is a review of a \'feminine product\' so there may be \'too much information\' for some readers.Before I tried this particular overnight pad, I would have to double layer the \'thin\' or \'regular\' thickness overnight pads in order to not bleed through during the night. Heavy and extra heavy pads were never absorbent enough. The similar sized (i.e. extra thick) pads would not stay fitted properly and caused leaks. The thicker pads I tried also twisted around to adhesive side up which was both very uncomfortable and caused them to not absorb correctly, so was also messy. I am concerned about toxic shock syndrome so I do not use tampons. I tried every brand of \'overnight\' or \'extra heavy\' pads out there at the time and none of them were up to it. I found these about three years ago and have not tried another heavy flow overnight pad since.With these Always brand Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings I never have to use more than one at a time. I\'ve never had leaks when using these pads and I don\'t have problems with them twisting around to adhesive side up. If you have extremely heavy menstrual flow then you should try these pads.It is true that they are extremely long and very thick. The pad length is such that some cuts of underwear will be too small (or short) in the back if you place the pad correctly. This causes the pad to overhang or stick out of the back of the underwear. This is remedied easily, but can be inconvenient. If this is something that you cannot stand then you should not get these pads.Regarding price, currently Amazon is offering a two pack for about 12 dollars. I\'ve seen big differences in price depending on where you get them (between 12 -20 for one pack)this is the lowest price I have seen so far (about 6 dollars for one pack)."
182,182,20110331,B0029NYQ6A,3,"March 31, 2011",A1XZKTBWHM3GBW,Work well but full of chemicals,"I used these postpartum with my first child. They worked very well, but the wings could be a bugger to get set right sometimes especially if the folded or something while you put them on.As an alternative, I do recommend cloth pads (there are some really great ones available out there.) They wash up really easy in my experience and you don\'t have to worry about chemicals. I also end up having less leaks, less itchiness etc when using cloth pads.Another alternative that I highly recommend is a menstrual cup. I have a seriously heavy flow and menstrual cups work wonderfully. (I\'m talking about the silicone kind that you wash and reuse)They hold about twice as much flow as a tampon and I wear cloth pads or liners for back up. I can wear a menstrual cup comfortably but I\'m unable to wear tampons. Most tampons are also full of icky chemicals.Natracare is a good brand of disposable menstrual protection that doesn\'t have all the icky chemicals if you just can\'t bring yourself to try the other things or if you need something disposable sometimes."
190,190,20100903,B0029NYQ6A,5,"September 3, 2010",A2X4DS5KRSZFHR,Excellent!!,"Perfect for heavy periods, especially to wear while sleeping, but other times as well. Excellent coverage and leak protection, especially for plus size ladies. I also highly recommend them for women suffering from urinary incontinence and/or interstitial cystitis for everyday wear. I would think cotton undies would work the best with these and be the most comfortable.  Two could be carried discreetly in a purse, inside a small zippered makeup case. After half a century this is one of very few products that in my opinion are perfectly designed."

Finally tired of wearing an overnight level absorbancy pad and a tampon just to be on the safe side, I decided to find another option. I saw a package of Always Overnight Extra Heavy Flow Maxi pads at my local Wal-Mart, and I thought it wouldn\'t hurt to try them out. W-o-w. First of all, this is a VERY long pad. It is about the length of two Always Ultra-Thin Overnight pads stuck together, and it pretty much expands from the top of my underwear to the back of them. Another helpful feature is that this pad contains two sets of wings--one in the middle like traditional pads and another set at the back. While, these pads DEFINITELY prevent leaks, I have a few complaints about this product. First of all, I\'ve noticed that when you remove the pad, it leaves a thin adhesive strip on your underwear that is hard to remove. So, though these pads keep you from having accidents, I still do not recommend that you wear your good underwear while using them.  Also, it is pretty hard to descreetly carry these in your purse, as they are VERY large. But other than that, I feel that they are an amazing product. Surprisingly, these pads don\'t feel like a diaper when I am wearing them, so that is a plus. However, I feel that women who are any smaller than a size twelve or fourteen might find them to be quite bulky, so I would take that into consideration. Also, if you are a woman who is already sticking two maximum coverage pads together just to feel comfortable, this maxi pad has about the same effect, so it will not be anything new to you. But overall, I will purchase these in the future."

It\'s been a long ride trying to find an overnight pad I could actually trust so I didn\'t bleed on my sheets. I had a hard time finding one, and every time seemed to fail at finding the perfect overnight pad. Then Always came out with the Always Maxi Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings and it is the best product I\'ve ever used for overnight use. For the day I use the Always Maximum Protection pads. Nothing beats Always...nothing! This pad has very good \'support\' up the front and back. I can sleep on my stomach, side, or back and have not one drop of blood on my sheets when I wake up. It\'s a great, great, great product, five stars, and I\'d recommend this to anyone with even regular periods, esp. heavy periods. A God-send!!!"

You could use this product for hours, and it seemed to keep me more fresh than others. The shape confirms better to your undergarments,than the other pads, in my opinion.

The length is just right - as a smaller person, I find the length of some pads too great, so have to pick and choose carefully among brands to find one that fits.

But I dreamed of something softer, something that wasn\'t rubbing against me and causing me irritation.  Finally, Always Infinity came along, and I\'ve been thrilled!Infinity Heavy Flow is perfect for  when I\'m having a heavy flow or need prolonged protection at night, when I need my pad to provide me with plenty of absorption.  The wings keep the pad secure, they actually wrap around and stick to my panty and the softness keeps me comfortable.  I like not thinking about my pad.  I also like that the pad is designed to be wider in the back.  I\'ve had experiences where my flow completely missed the pad, due to it being too short.  Length is very important if you\'re sitting or laying down for long periods of time.  Also, this is a good pad if you\'re a plus-sized lady.  What length size you choose also depends on your weight too, not just your flow.Out of the various pads that I\'ve purchased, I find that the Infinity series is a bit more expensive, but it is worth the extra change for the comfort and security.  Always Infinity Regular was my go to pad, but now, since trying out the Infinity Heavy Flow, I think I\'ll start using these for nighttime. A big plus, is that this brand comes in unscented, yea!  I don\'t have to worry about irritation due to deodorants that don\'t mask anything.  If you haven\'t tried this brand, do so, you will notice the comfort, immediately."

My first reaction was that the pad was a lot longer than similar products I\'ve used, but this turned out to be a good thing.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with how well the new technology worked to absorb away from your body. Even on my heaviest days I didn\'t have any leaks and I didn\'t feel bulky as I sometimes can feel. The new design has a wider back and channels that help with faster absorption.

They are of the thin absorbent variety, which avoids the diaper feeling.  The adhesive sticks well, which is always important.  The new wing design is better shaped to fit the contours of panties than flat wings.  While there are special channels and different shaped openings in the top layer, I am not convinced that the actual effect is significantly different than with other thin absorbent pads. The shape is wider at the back which is good for overnight use.  And while not really significant, the packaging is prettier.  Bottom line, the pads are better designed but I wouldn\'t pay a premium over other pads of this type."

I guess that just depends on the type of flow you have, because they do seem to absorb well for me and other people.  However, I can see why they wouldn\'t be very absorbant for some people, because it seems to take a tad longer to absorb than other pads.  So I guess it just depends on the person\'s flow.For me, it\'s no better or worse than any other pad that I\'ve worn, absorbant-wise.  It\'s just more expensive.  I do, however, HATE ultra-thin pads because I think they feel like wearing paper.

The scent is so faint that I didn\'t even realize it was scented at first. To me, that\'s a good thing, but if you\'re expecting something stronger, you\'ll be disappointed. The thing that I HATED about these pads is that they remind me of the OLD school kotex pads, that were thick and bulky with a paper-like lining. I miss the standard Always dry weave texture. To me, these pads seem like a budget version -- like a bad store brand. And we all joked about the wings, but really, I think the wings are good. Thumbs down on this product ladies -- too many other good options out there to pick this one."

He found that the maxi pads were comfortable and worked well for him at night....better than the guards which would come unattached and irritate the area.

Only someone who doesn\'t have a heavy flow would think these are bulky.  This is more comfortable than the comparable maxis that also make sure you don\'t have accidents.- Odor control is good, barely discernable (if you don\'t notice any odor, it\'s all good!)- Wide, so even without wings you don\'t get accidents.I\'ve had no accidents with these, and they\'re even good when you come home from the hospital after having a baby and don\'t want to use the monster-sized pads they give you."

If you suffer from accidents just like me (for example the bedsheets have blood where I was laying on because I was dripping from the back of my underwear), then this product is for you. I will almost always suffer from this accident, but because the product was long, it covered almost to the back of my panty preventing this from happening. I can\'t really comment on the odor-lock but from what I can tell, it smell a bit less I would guess. But again, I don\'t go out of my way to check if one pad is smellier after use than another since flows vary every menstrual cycle.This product is good if you are accident-prone (you leak from the back when you are sitting because of a heavy flow)"

Although I\'m used to using the pads with wings, since these pads are Always pads I figured I give them a chance. I tried these pads and true to the Always brand, these pads stood up. Now, they\'re somewhat thicker than the other Always pads that I\'m used to, but to my surprise they were still comfortable. I didn\'t have any leaks and when I put them in place, they stayed in place. So did these pads hold up to the quality of the Always brand? They sure did! Great quality pads!"

I have never switched to any other brand during this time because I like the design and it makes us feel more comfortable during periods. This is another new design introduced by Always which helps avoid leakage outside your pads. This design does not have wings but lightly scented but it is of the same size as Long/Super. This is with enough thickness and I would have liked it more if it had been with wings. Otherwise it is a great product and please do not forget to try this and add it to your essential items.

I\'ve been a big fan of Always branded pads since they first came out. Nice channels direct flow to be absorbed before spilling over and they stay in place. I\'ve previously always gotten the thicker \'over night\' and \'extra long\' versions because of my over-the-top leak paranoia... but I gave these thinner pads a go and I did not have any incidents. I\'ve always avoided scented feminine products, because the last thing I\'d want to do  is attract attention to an area that needs no spectators or inquisitors. These pads really are \'lightly scented\' - just pleasant and not the over-powering all-familiar scent that is present in public bathrooms."

These pads are thicker than ultra thins, but still comfortable and not diaperish to wear.  I was concerned about leakage without wings, but after using these I\'ve decided wings are required for ultra thins but not these maxis - there is zero side leakage.  The scent is so subtle that at first I did not realize these pads are scented.  While I prefer an ultra thin pad, these are definitely not my mom\'s thick, pseudo-diapers from my teen years."

I often get what the chinese call \'Liver Yang Rising\', which results in a lot of hot tempered conditions.  Aloe Vera is very Yin tonifying, and it\'s always brought me great balance.  I love it.I was in the Vitamin Store, and saw this George\'s aloe.  I always buy the Lily of the Desert stuff, but this caught my eye, and I bought it. The price was similar in comparison.  I thought, what the heck, I\'ll give it a try.I\'m about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, and I now realize that I notice NONE of the beneficial Yin tonifying effects that traditional Aloe Vera Juice gives you.  Pretty much none whatsoever.  This Aloe tastes like distilled water.  Has no taste whatsoever.  A good part of Aloe\'s medicine is in the bitter.  All medicines in nature have a bitter tasting element to them.  Bitter is healing.  When you remove the bitter, I\'m not so sure it\'s healing anymore.I was reading through the testiominals on here, and they all seem stomach related.  Perhaps it has a beneficial effect on stomach woes, but since I don\'t have any, it did nothing for me.  It had no effect on my Liver Yang Rising, and I feel like the cooling, Yin tonifying effects just aren\'t there with this aloe.Not a big deal, wasted some money, but I\'m going right back to Lily of the Desert."

So, after much research, I kept coming back to Aloe Vera Juice. George\'s was recommended for it\'s taste and texture. I\'ve been using it for a month. It took about a good week or so to really kick in, but I haven\'t experienced any heartburn, reflux, etc. I wasn\'t expecting it to work as well as it does. I would recommend this to everyone with any type of digestive issues. It\'s not instantanious, but it is so worth it when it does work. I drink 2 oz in the morning and 2 oz at night. It has the exact same feel, taste and texture as water. I have a real issue with taste and texture and this didn\'t bother me at all!!!! I\'ll keep you posted if there are any changes, good or bad."

Since then I\'ve ordered gift bottles for family and friends also undergoing treatment.  Certainly it\'s not curative, but is soothing and helps deal with the side effects.  I think it\'s a good idea for general use, whether used as a topical or for drinking.  I prefer it cold but it doesn\'t need to be refrigerated.
