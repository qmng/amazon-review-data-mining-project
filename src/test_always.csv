They are thin, absorbent, and fit snuggly into my panties just like my other pads.  In fact, they hide my feminine needs from the boys even better.  I now wear one every gym class."

2,2,20110524,B0012IYKOG,4,"May 24, 2011",A2T8JLXZ1WMXSU,The Best Value For The Money,"This price is the best I\'ve found (for 76 pads!!) I\'ve been using Always pads for years. Every time I\'ve tried other brands, I\'ve been disappointed. In my opinion, these are the best. However, calling them \'overnight\' is a bit of a stretch. Unless you are quite slender, with a light flow, one of these will not be sufficient for overnight use. But they are the best choice for daytime use in my opinion. They are ultra-thin and do not appear bulky under jeans or pants."

It stinks because when I ordered them, I got a message stating that the estimated ship date was more than a month away. That month came and went and nothing doing.You might want to order these elsewhere."

Even the largest of women would find those things ridiculous, and I\'m not a large woman at all...they\'re almost too big for my underwear, and they don\'t adhere to anything. This is one of the worst Always products I\'ve ever bought."

These pads are designed to cover every conceivable area that could result in embarrassment or unwanted staining, are extremely absorbent and not bulky to boot.  Even if one uses tampons, some may prefer using pads at night.  We find that the duration of our cycles is shortened and intensity of flow is lessened by doing this.  With 3 daughters, we know our way around feminine products and Always has always been our primary choice ever since it came to market.  The subscribe and save feature is so convenient and we love it.  No more last minute rushing to the store because you run out.  Recommend."

We have used the Always Overnight Maxi pads in her diapers for years now, and she has never had a problem with them-- in other words, they absorb well while keeping her clean and dry."

I\'m either switching brands or switching suppliers. These are great pads, but not worth the HUGE price increase, which is significantly more than I would pay in the store."

As a nurse, I have heard every combination of pads and tampons for nighttime coverage.  Conducting some studies myself, I am convinced this is a superior product and will simplify the horrendous nighttime guessing game.  The pad can hold an amazing amount of flow without spilling onto bedlinens and is very comfortable.  Thanks for getting this one right at long last!"

46,46,20110716,B001LK6QJW,1,"July 16, 2011",A2XD6KQB1A407W,Great if you have perfectly predictable periods,"I tried these liners and initially liked them since they are so very thin and comfortable. Unfortunately, wearing them on the last couple days of my period during some very light spotting was a huge mistake. I had a sudden, unexpected increase in spotting amounting to less than a teaspoon and they leaked through the bottom, ruining my panties and jeans! They\'re probably fine if you just want to wear them in between periods, but the U by Kotex liners are just as comfy and actually have a waterproof base."
51,51,20101008,B001LK6QJW,1,"October 8, 2010",A1FVO9ZB49ZCXA,Tiny!,"I am a small person and these liners are TINY. They are not long and they are not wide either. I\'m talking DINKY. The description says \'Larger than our regular pad for overnight protection\' - I am scared to know how small their \'regular pad\' is, if this this considered the large size.I just spent $10.32 on them but I will have to go out to get some normal sizes. Don\'t waste your money!!!"
52,52,20100731,B001LK6QJW,5,"July 31, 2010",A1OKBNBAO5TURA,Very Good,"These liners are great, very comfortable and extremely absorbent. I have even chanced wearing these on light flowing days and they work great. Perfect for everyday protection as well."
53,53,20091023,B001LK6QJW,4,"October 23, 2009",A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,Dependable protection,"Always thin pantiliners are great for those very light spotting days -- mild protection without the bulk and humidity, if you know what I mean.  I like them because they hold in place well, they protect my clothing.  They are individually wrapped, which makes them more portable; and they are so lightweight and comfortable, I don\'t even know they are there.  That\'s important, because some brands are stiff and feel a bit like cardboard.  I prefer the unscented variety but scented is fine."

I have had abcesses under both of my arms for at least 3 years and have tried everything in an effort to bandage under my arms.  Underarms are very difficult due to moisture and shape.  Bandaids come off due to moisture and also are very hard on skin tissue.  These have been an absolute Godsend since they have the capacity to absorb the moisture, fit in a difficult area and also stay in place without removing skin upon removal.  Thank you."

They are definitely much larger (width and length) than any liners I have ever used, and they are very absorbent, so you continue to feel fresh.  I hope they never stop making them."

Many years ago, I found pads by Always that were geared for women who wear sizes 14 and up -- and have since had difficulty being able to consistently find them.The difference is that the pads for sizes 14 and up are longer and offer more protection. I found that Overnight pads are about the same length, and can be helpful in a pinch. But this review is not about the pads.Over the last few years, I have been fortunate enough to lose some weight, and with it, find myself with a generally lighter flow. Pads can get costly, especially when they are barely used, and I found the Always Pantyliners, which did me decently well.The last time I needed pads and liners, I found myself (newly unemployed) in sticker-shock at the drugstore. Sometimes, I guess we forget just how much the odds and ends cost when we\'re not thinking about money. So I came to Amazon, and in looking for my products, found the Always Pantyliner - made for sizes 14 and up. I did not know this existed, but I quickly decided to go ahead and make the purchase in liu of the regular pantyliner.The size is slightly longer and wider, and I am so much more comfortable that there is more coverage. I\'m glad Always has taken larger women into consideration, and every plus size woman should know that there is a product out there to protect her, too!"
62,62,20101206,B001LK6XG8,5,"December 6, 2010",A9G1YGH2QHE3T,Absolute BEST liners!,"I\'ve used these with no problems at all, daily, for almost 10 years in America -- and in Europe whenever I can find them.This combination of \'Extra Long 14+\' in \'Fresh Scent\' is getting harder and harder to find in any stores. I\'m concerned that a few people\'s loudly-stated assumption that the scent caused their infections may have convinced the company to drop them rather than have negative PR.Infections CAN happen, arguably more often if you\'re hypersensitive or do not keep reasonably clean. Liners should certainly be changed before aroma has a chance to develop, every few hours if necessary, but how much easier and more effective it is to swap out a liner than one\'s panties when you\'re on the go! And it\'s exactly when you\'re running all over in public that rhe extra security of this style is a gift!"

They are so hard to find in stores, and like anyone else, I have only so much time to waste in brick and morter stores anyway.  So glad to have found them online."
67,67,20100325,B00284B4PQ,5,"March 25, 2010",A358D87VUQT72,Great Product,these are the best idea yet.  They fit regular panties and thong...plus they are the perfect thickness for everyday wear and those awful leaks.  So flexible you forget you\'re wearing one.

71,71,20120301,B0029NYPUC,5,"March 1, 2012",AOB9IYQVOA76U,this pad is \'growing\' with me.,"I am now 24, and am basically the same size I was in high school (smaller, actually). The design/doodles on the packaging seem to market these pads towards teens/smaller girls who are just starting their periods. I am a size 4-6, and these pads fit really well in my panties. I wear normal bikini/hiphugger panties that cannot seem to \'fit\' standard thin pads, with or without wings. This is the first pad where I actually was able to use the wings simply to secure and hold the pad in place...as opposed to normal/larger pads, with which I tend to use the wings as a \'belt\' to strap the pad into place, so that the wings significantly overlap on the outside of the panty material. really annoying, uncomfortable, and does not offer much leak protection. These slender pads are great - they do not seem to wick away moisture as well as some other pads with a cotton-y surface that remains dry while pulling moisture into the \'core\' of the pad. in fact, the \'mesh,\' surface layer of these pads seems to pull away from the bottom/stick part of the pad if they are too saturated. however, obviously, if your flow is that heavy, you should be changing your pad more often...lady life lessons!bottom-line though, there is no fault of these pads that outweigh the advantage of the appropriate size and \'stay-in-place\' fit. I hope to find them in other sizes/absorbencies, but for now, these are my go-to pads. GREAT price on amazon, these are often hard to find in my local stores and even with the regular P&G coupons, the price is better (with no trip to the store!) from amazon. couldn\'t be more pleased."
76,76,20110517,B0029NYPUC,5,"May 17, 2011",A3SP7Q41PG4ZGP,Excellent for teenagers or petite frames,My teenage daughter really loves these.  She is very thin and has a very narrow frame.  Basically she\'s 5\' 5\' and a size 0.  She didn\'t like the standard Always Ultra Thins because she felt they were too wide.  I was thrilled to have found these on Amazon.com.  They work very well for her.

I got them for camping, hiking, and backpacking -- those times when you don\'t have the comforts of a bathroom.  These wipes are lightweight, portable, and definitely do the job.  I actually keep these stashed in my car and backpack so that I never forget to take them with me."

I started using it and I was really happy with it. I am a loyal customer of always and this product is great to take in your purse and keep in your bathroom. I already had the container from my target purchase so I bought the refill packs and it was a great price. I still have some left and I keep them with me at all times. Great buy! will definitely repurchase :-)

I noticed there was one very negative comment about them, but I have a hard time understanding that since I\'ve tried several of the other brands and have been deeply disappointed. They don\'t come close to working as well as the Infinity Overnights."
107,107,20111125,B0029NYQ1K,5,"November 25, 2011",A326SZ4A6LVE4S,Best overnight product around,"Sent my hubby to Walmart for these and they were sold out so I ordered from Amazon.  Product arrived in a timely fashion and as described.  This product, IMHO is the best overnite protection available.  Nothing I\'ve ever used before these worked as well, absorbed as much or was easy on my skin as these. Would buy again and again."

And with these you don\'t feel gross, you\'re extremely comfortable, and they do absorb a lot more than the others. I still leak, but not as much. They\'re definitely not perfect, the wings are a bit too short and the pad itself isn\'t as wide as I\'d like, but I give it 5 stars because it\'s still the best pad on the market."

117,117,20120424,B0029NYQ2E,5,"April 24, 2012",ADY4OCBSMNVKE,"Heavy Flo, great product",I have tried many different pads throughout the years and Infiniti by Always has been the best. My periods usually only last a couple of days but are heavy. I never seem to have any problems with it leaking or staining my clothing. They are very absorbent and very comfortable.
118,118,20120221,B0029NYQ2E,2,"February 21, 2012",ANDSFDPKUQ1Q4,Not absorbent enough for me!,"Seems like mixed reviews for this, so I thought I should put my 2 cents in to add to the confusion. I was impressed with the quality of the pad; definitely explains why it cost more. Its actually quite thin compared to other pads that claim \'heavy absorbency\' , and the texture/density reminds me of  a makeup applicator sponge. The double wings was a good idea, but like some of the reviewers have mentioned- it did not seems to stick as well to certain underwear, and if it can\'t be relied on to stick well on EVERY underwear in your drawer, well- the reliability issue is moot already! And reliability is important if your are out and about, in and out of chairs, meeting with people constantly, and can\'t always run to the restroom when you feel that doomsday leakage- b/c then,  please don\'t rely on this pad.  When I have a heavy day- its heavy like Niagara Falls heavy where it feels like 1/2 pint just unleashes in one split second (sorry for the graphics, but I\'m trying to make a point, and those who have my type of heavy will know exactly what I mean), and this little fella just did not do it for me on a busy day when I don\'t have a restroom to run to. The absorbency rate on this high-tech pad is TOO SLOW for my type of \'Unleash thy furry\' Heavy days, and it just seemed to spill over the side like a shallow raft that can not contain its occupants (while going over the edge of Niagara Falls).  Every time I wore it on a heavy day, my underwear was dirtied to the extent where an extra pair of underwear was necessary! Does it sound gross? Yes- it was.  It you want to avoid grossness, do avoid this pad!  I saved the pad for my guaranteed light days and was able to finish my high tech pads in that manner, but I would not buy this again. Too bad- it does look and feel promising.  Hope my frank and honest review helps out any undecided non-tampon users."
124,124,20111103,B0029NYQ2E,2,"November 3, 2011",A37XHG5LLONQH2,"no comfortable, too thick",It is too thick and I fell quite uncomfortable with it.It is my mistake to choose this one. It may suit for someone who sit all day.

ALMOST."
128,128,20110917,B0029NYQ2E,5,"September 17, 2011",AWNQ2PULUBHDH,Amazing and worth trying!,"I can\'t believe I\'m actually writing a review for this, but I\'ve used Always Infinity for about a year now and I have to admit that I actually stock up on these pads.  I\'m really sorry that others haven\'t had the good results I have, but I can\'t help wondering if they didn\'t read the **UNSCENTED** description or what.For the convenience and absorbency of these pads, they can\'t be beat (trust me, I\'ve tried them all for almost 3 decades now)!  These are made from what I can only describe as a \'Dr. Scholl\'s-like\' material.  The pad is VERY comfortable and definitely breathes.  If you\'re an active female, or have an extremely heavy flow, then you should definitely be conscious of having to change out the pad throughout the day.  These Infinity pads are SUPER absorbent - what\'s seen on the surface of the pad is only about 1/3 of what\'s actually being held.  So please keep that in mind.  I normally have a heavy flow and sometimes had issues at night (I sleep on my belly) and that was always a big problem during \'my time\' when the pad I\'d use would leak.  Not at all the case with these!Always Infinity DOES tend to cost more than other brands, but if you keep an eye out (as I do) you can find a decent in-store sale.  For the convenience of having these delivered, the Amazon price is on-par with what these are retailing for."

Even though they are expensive I always luck up on a coupon when I need more. Now that i have found these on amazon I will start buying them from here instead of from the store. Since if I buy these in the store I would be paying $14.00 for two boxes. Great save, great deal, great product."

So every month for 5 days since I was ten, I\'ve had to suffer with basically a plastic diaper in my pants. The itchiness, the unbreathable plastic, the bulk. So a few months ago I got a sample of these in my regular box of pads, and all I can say is that I\'m hooked! No more plastic sticking to your butt. No more wet diaper feeling. No more bunching up in your underwear. No more wishing I was a bigger girl so that I could enjoy the freedom of tampons. The only thing that would make them better for me is if the had a wingless version, (I\'ve never really needed wings on my pads,) and a smaller, light flow day version. They are slightly longer (and wider in the rear) than the average pad but for me that is an improvement as I have felt that many pads available were too short, meaning I had to be careful how I sat/reclined when using one. Girls with heavy flows may still find these inadequate but as a moderate flow girl I find these to be better than the regular maxi pad. Did I mention They\'re so much more comfortable? Love, love, love."

A PAD SHOULD BE A PAD, NOT A FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER WITH IRONED STYROFOAM SHOVED INSIDE OF IT. BALLED UP TISSUE PAPER FEEL BETTER AND SAFER. I MEAN IT WORKED FOR A FEW HOURS, BUT YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE THING INTO THE CREVICE TO MAKE SURE IT\'S THERE. STRAIGHT UP CHEAPIFIED CRAP. PEOPLE ARE THINKING THEY CAN MAKE CHEAP CRAP AND PASS IT OFF AS SOMETHING NEW AND DIFFERENT. MOST DON\'T FALL FOR IT. I SPENT 8 BUCKS AT THE STORE FOR THIS CRAP, NO MORE THOUGH."
137,137,20100515,B0029NYQ2E,5,"May 15, 2010",A2PPKOUDNFPD3,Shocked!,"I got a free sample of this to try, thinking it would be like any other Always pad (which is my favorite brand, after all), but boy was I wrong! When I first opened it, I was confused. I\'d never seen anything like it. It was so strangely light and yet didn\'t seem like it should be. The material made me think of memory foam, only super soft textured.With how thin it was at the top, I didn\'t think it would be impressive for my flow (I have endometriosis, so that means I always have to wear overnight or better, maximum protection pads to keep up with my super flow, sometimes in addition to a tampon, which I hate wearing). Well, it worked great and it really felt like I didn\'t have anything on.I decided to actually buy the product this period to see if it was just a fluke and put it to the test immediately with my worst time--overnight on my heaviest night. When even the best pads have failed me in the past.Not a drop off the pad. The wings held and only in one place did it even leave the center of the top (the entire bottom was filled). And I felt DRY. If I hadn\'t seen the bottom, I\'d have thought maybe there was no flow overnight.I tried another today and got that familiar \'overproducing\' feeling that always leads to pad failure. I went to the bathroom, expecting a mess and the pad had contained it completely. It hadn\'t approached any edges. I was shocked and amazed. I\'ve never had a pad work this well, in 15 years of super-heavy periods, that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage.What\'s more, I almost always get irritation on this day in my cycle. Nada. I am SOLD.So, to recap: it held more than any other pad I\'ve seen that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage. It left NO irritation on a heavy day. It worked overnight on my worst night. And I feel dry--it absorbs faster than anything I\'ve ever worn. I\'ve never felt compelled to review a product as strongly as this before, lol. Probably hormones ;)"

I was skeptical about the thinness of it, but it performs like a dream. No more diaper like pads for me. These are even comfortable to jog in. Not a big fan of the tampon, but I wore them when I jogged because the thick pads just rubbed me the wrong way. It was nice to find a good exercise buddy in the infinity pad."

This time around I decided on trying Infinity based on the description and a sale at the grocery store.  I was amazed.  They are thin, the top stays pretty much dry/a bit damp, and they absorb a lot.  Of course, each woman\'s body is different so this may not be the same for you.I travel and live a lot in countries where I may not be able to make it to a washroom to change my pad for quite some time, and these have held up immensely.  Even plane, train, automobile travel - no issues.  I started passing out a couple at a time to friends to try because I find them so revolutionary."

It keeps you dry even during intense exercise. And because it\'s so absorbent, when your period ambushes you, you wont suffer from an embarrassing leakage. It could actually hold off until you can get to the restroom to change to a legit pad/tamponThe reason i gave it four stars is that these aren\'t individually wrapped, so you can\'t just toss them in your purse and run.

They are too thin to be used as anything but a pantyliner, but they are too long to be comfortably used as that. Plus, the sticky part never stayed where it was supposed to. It always ended up turning toward my body, which meant that there was some pulling in areas I\'d rather not be pulled. I tried the pads a few different times, but was never sold.

This latest product blows their others out of the water. It doesn\'t feel as \'plasticky\', but instead more natural, and is ridiculously absorbent. It literally takes the fluid away from your body. You could use this product for hours, and it seemed to keep me more fresh than others. The shape confirms better to your undergarments,than the other pads, in my opinion.

But I dreamed of something softer, something that wasn\'t rubbing against me and causing me irritation.  Finally, Always Infinity came along, and I\'ve been thrilled!Infinity Heavy Flow is perfect for  when I\'m having a heavy flow or need prolonged protection at night, when I need my pad to provide me with plenty of absorption.  The wings keep the pad secure, they actually wrap around and stick to my panty and the softness keeps me comfortable.  I like not thinking about my pad.  I also like that the pad is designed to be wider in the back.  I\'ve had experiences where my flow completely missed the pad, due to it being too short.  Length is very important if you\'re sitting or laying down for long periods of time.  Also, this is a good pad if you\'re a plus-sized lady.  What length size you choose also depends on your weight too, not just your flow.Out of the various pads that I\'ve purchased, I find that the Infinity series is a bit more expensive, but it is worth the extra change for the comfort and security.  Always Infinity Regular was my go to pad, but now, since trying out the Infinity Heavy Flow, I think I\'ll start using these for nighttime. A big plus, is that this brand comes in unscented, yea!  I don\'t have to worry about irritation due to deodorants that don\'t mask anything.  If you haven\'t tried this brand, do so, you will notice the comfort, immediately."

Although I\'m a loyal Always user, I had never tried their Infinity line of pads - honestly, I didn\'t know if they were that much better than their regular line to spend the extra bucks.Right away, I was shocked when opening the wrapper to see that the pad appears full of holes (over-my-head engineering towards absorbency, I suppose -- or perhaps aerodynamics? Ha!). Anyway, there IS a liner underneath, but it still looks a bit frightening. I bravely wore one, and yes, the absorbency and dryness was slightly better than the current Always products I use. The holes did their job.However, my favorite part of the Infinity pad is the wing design! I never would have thought much about it (wings are wings, I thought), but the Infinity pad has a scalloped \'B\' edge to its wing. I had more successful \'sticking\' of the Infinity\'s wing than I\'ve ever had with a normal curved \'D\' edged wing. Usually the wings (though very important and necessary to me in a pad), cause the most stress and hassle when applying! Part of it sticks, part of it doesn\'t and curls upward, leaving sticky spots exposed. Not comfortable. So, the \'B\' shaped edge of the Infinity pad was a plus!Overall, I would definitely use the Infinity pads again, but probably only if I had a coupon to defray the extra cost. Either way, I trust Always\' products for confident protection!"

When you could really FEEL like it was that time of the month?  Well, now you can relive those days, but better! With modern technology!These pads are durable, absorbent, stick well, and have a nice soft outer layer. But... well, they\'re bulky and wingless. I wasn\'t very comfortable, and I got leaks, but that\'s the nature of the design. If that\'s what you\'re looking for, these are a good choice.

I have had no issues with leakage and the scent is pleasant without being overpowering.  My only complaint is that they are pretty bulky.  There are other pads on the market that absorb as well and as much without the bulk of these.  When I opened the box I was actually surprised at how big the package was for 20 pads, but that is due to how thick they are.  But, overall, they do the job and if the thickness doesn\'t bother you, I think you\'ll be very happy with the quality of the product."

If you suffer from accidents just like me (for example the bedsheets have blood where I was laying on because I was dripping from the back of my underwear), then this product is for you. I will almost always suffer from this accident, but because the product was long, it covered almost to the back of my panty preventing this from happening. I can\'t really comment on the odor-lock but from what I can tell, it smell a bit less I would guess. But again, I don\'t go out of my way to check if one pad is smellier after use than another since flows vary every menstrual cycle.This product is good if you are accident-prone (you leak from the back when you are sitting because of a heavy flow)"
343,346,20110924,B004J36GES,4,"September 24, 2011",A1AG7F4Z1EOO5L,Comfortable for those not so comfy days!,"For those of us who experience a fairly heavy flow at times, these Always pads really fit the bill.I\'ll rate these pads on the basis of a few key factors.- Comfort: the top layer of these pads are designed so that they won\'t irritate the skin.  I found this to be a huge plus, especially when worn overnight.  No chafing or irritation, even when worn while working out for about an hour.- Reliability: No leaks or staining even with heavy flow.  The channels on the pad help to lock in flow plus I found the pad stays in place very well, especially for a pad without wings.- Thickness: Here\'s where these pads lose some points.  A fellow reviewer compared these to a baby\'s diaper - I agree these are quite thick but willing to accept that for the positive factors above.  For overnight use the thickness of this pad isn\'t too big of a deal, but I wouldn\'t recommend wearing this pad under very tight fitting clothing (then again, maybe tight fitting clothes aren\'t such a good idea for the days you need a super maxi!)"

It\'s not the bulkiest pad out there but not the thinnest either. I liked the length personally and felt it kept a drier feel to the skin than most pads.Item smell was light and not over powering.  Plus it seemed to help control the smell of contents.Bottomline, this is one of those products that people usually stick with brands they know they\'ve grown to trust from trial and error.  For me, I\'d buy it again on sale but I still prefer my ultra thin maxi pads of a different brand.  I also think pads with wings offer more protection for side leaks."

I\'ve been a big fan of Always branded pads since they first came out. Nice channels direct flow to be absorbed before spilling over and they stay in place. I\'ve previously always gotten the thicker \'over night\' and \'extra long\' versions because of my over-the-top leak paranoia... but I gave these thinner pads a go and I did not have any incidents. I\'ve always avoided scented feminine products, because the last thing I\'d want to do  is attract attention to an area that needs no spectators or inquisitors. These pads really are \'lightly scented\' - just pleasant and not the over-powering all-familiar scent that is present in public bathrooms."

My son has a severe peanut allergy, and apparently with allergies comes eczema (skin condition that causes open sores).  We\'ve used steroids with limited results, and we don\'t like using it very much nor does my son as it\'s a pretty strong medicine.For some reason, my memory was triggered and I remembered my Japanese mother growing aloe plants and using them on us when we had an injury or received a burn (happens when you grow up on a farm).  I wasn\'t thinking of prevention, but healing his open sores that were getting pretty bad--on his arms, behind his legs, on his feet, and on his inner thighs.  (He is entering his teenage years, and is obviously very sensitive about his skin.  The kids at school always ask why he wears long pants, and not shorts like they do in school and after school).Long story short, I came across \'George\'s Aloe\' and thought what the heck, can\'t hurt.  It\'s a natural product and worth a try.  I also read that Aloe is a natural antihistimine.  We\'ve been using it for a week on our son, and the results are very positive.  It hasn\'t prevented the outbreaks, but it has diminished them noticeably.  I would say upwards of 80% improvement.  The spring is the worst time for my son, and it\'s been very manageable.  My wife and I have noticed a significant improvement in his condition and he drinks a small glass of George\'s Aloe every morning.  I tried it, and it indeed does take like water.  Read the directions, though, as you don\'t need much.I\'ve since supplemented the \'internal\' treatment with an external treatment of the actual aloe plant rubbed on the outside of his body (arms, legs, feet, etc.).  You basically just cut off a very small part of the leaf, and it\'s a gel inside.  I rub that on his sores, pimples, and hives and paired with the Aloe juice, has had a dramatic effect, a definite improvement for the better.  My son is much more relaxed of late, and very happy with the results.  It\'s not perfect by any means, but he itches a LOT less and he doesn\'t have the open weeping sores that he had before.  Again, it\'s not perfect, but a huge improvement.I think for others in the same situation, it\'s worth a try.  I would just make sure there isn\'t some sort of allergy to it--but I\'ve never heard of an allergic reaction to Aloe.Finally, my wife has tried a lot of remedies on my son: lotions, aforementioned steroids, hot showers followed by vaseline to keep the moisture in, etc., and none of them has had the same noticeable positive effect as Warren Laboratories \'George\'s Aloe\'.A very enthusiastic and strong 5 Stars for this product.I hope you find a use for it, too."

I have been on Nexium for 5+ years & get a little concerned about taking it for so long, even though my gastroenterologist says it\'s fine. I have not been able to go one day without taking Nexium until I started drinking George\'s Aloe. A friend of mine heard about George\'s Aloe from her holistic pharmacist. George\'s Aloe has no taste or texture - it\'s like drinking water. I drink about 2 oz. every other day - the days I don\'t take Nexium.Another side benefit is that my hair is thicker. My beautician noticed that my hair wasn\'t falling out like it used to, and we attributed it to George\'s Aloe.One of the reasons I decided aloe might work for me is because when I was visiting St. John, USVI, I went on an island tour. Our tour guide pulled to the side of the road & showed us an aloe plant. He said that when their babies get sick, they put a little aloe in their baby bottles & they get better. Apparently aloe also helps with thinning mucus.So many uses for aloe, who knew? Now you do!"

Then I developed another occasional and very painful inflammation in my eyes which almost blinded me with pain.  Both are autoimmune problems.I have had every treatment conceivable, some with serious side effects.  Trying to address the burning, I drank this product one night,  and had relief by morning.  It has worked everytime.  For ulcersin my mouth,  I swish it around before swallowing. (These are not herpes...don\'t know how it would work for that)It has been used for centuries for burns.  I trust most folk medicine because it has had thousands of human trials and if it didn\'t work, or killed people,  the treatment would not have survived.This product was such a miracle for me, I tried to research it\'s efficacy.  It seems that aloe contains a substance which inhibits the proliferation of mast cells.  Mast cells are what triggers the production of histamines which results in the inflammatory response.I like George\'s because the others have preservatives, can cause diarhrea and have a bad taste.  I just wish it wasn\'t so expensive.  But it is worth it."
