125,125,20111230,B00284B59G,4,"December 30, 2011",A2UQEX65M8CS6U,Really works for extra heavy flow days,Used these on day 2 and day 3 and was able to wear white uniform pants.  I definitely recommend these to anyone who needs extra protection.
153,153,20110202,B0029NYQQA,5,"February 2, 2011",A2WJTM8UD6HKY3,Fantastic,"I love these tampons so much that I haven\'t used anything else since I first discovered them two years ago! I don\'t know why other reviewers are saying that they take some \'getting used to\' ... they are EXACTLY like any other tampon except that they\'re stored \'in half\', so to speak - the tampon half inside of the applicator half - for greater discretion. Once you click them open (which takes about one second - if you can click a ballpoint pen, you can do this) they are exactly like every other tampon, and you just insert them as normal.Another great thing about these tampons is the packaging. The external package (the part that says \'Tampax Compak Pearl\') contains four boxes of 10 tampons each: one purple box of 10 lites, two yellow boxes of 10 regulars, and one green box of 10 supers. The color-coded boxes are very discreet; they are just pretty patterns with no words printed on them at all. Very nice for when you want to store some tampons in your desk at work, in your locker at school, or in your boyfriend\'s bathroom. ;)"
104,104,20110617,B001LK6XI6,5,"June 17, 2011",AOY1BUICNSYYK,Perfect,"I normally use the Super Tampax Pearl at the beginning, however i find these to work better later on during my period. Like all other Tampax Pearl the string is what makes this product amazing, since it prevents leaking. The applicator is also amazing, easy to hold and MUCH easier to use than the paper cardboard ones.I myself prefer the unscented version, since the scented smells a bit too strong and chemically."
143,143,20101018,B00284B59G,5,"October 18, 2010",A165SAZZONY1P4,love \'em,"I\'ve always had to rely on OB Ultra tampons to deal with my excessively heavy flow as they are the only tampon out there that is up to the job. I hate though that they have no applicators.  The Tampax Pearl Ultra is just as good as the OB Ultra and there is the very useful, non messy applicator. Makes a yucky situation a bit more bearable."

89,89,20110617,B001LK6XHC,5,"June 17, 2011",AOY1BUICNSYYK,Great Variety,"I prefer the Tampax Pearl to many other brands, due to its comfortable applicator and reliable protection. I mostly got this box because of the price, which is a lot cheaper than buying in store. However, the variety (light, regular, super) allowed me to try different types and find the ones that work best for me. Every woman is different and might have a different experience with these."

This has got to be my favorite christmas present.  They were just so much fun to use!  Which reminds me, I was disappointed I was only able to find these new.  I can usually get a discount by buying used on amazon, but I don\'t find any of these plastic lite pearls for sale used anywhere?!Ok, so I bought these for my wife and I\'m being a bit tongue in cheek.  She was really happy."
99,99,20111117,B001LK6XI6,5,"November 17, 2011",AVLTBIVBNEZOI,Great Buy,"Purchasing this product in bulk through Amazon is an excellent deal, especially when compared to the prices of smaller quantities sold at Walgreens and Target."
54,54,20110920,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 20, 2011",A3CHMHGSJSQ02J,Good multipack,"Like many reviewers have said, this multipack has just the right mix of sizes/absorbencies for the average woman. One of the things I normally don\'t like about plastic-applicator tampons is the heavy fragrance/scent. It just seems unhealthy to me, and it\'s one of the reasons I prefer cardboard applicators. The Unscented tampons here are a great idea. The plastic applicator is also easier to use than others I\'ve tried, which are always much too thin in the \'grip\' area, causing (TMI ALERT) painful stabbing and pinching.I\'ll probably gravitate back to my usual cardboard Tampax, but this product is definitely a good value for those who prefer plastic."
81,81,20110830,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 30, 2011",A22I55P15NSAOX,Easy to use and the variety is useful.  Excellent protection.,"Although the plastic does generate more non biodegradable waste it makes the use of this product so much simpler, especially for girls just starting to use tampons.  Including various sizes means that you can select the minimum absorbency needed.  Although I tend to gravitate toward the cheaper (and more earth friendly) cardboard versions I do buy these Pearls for my daughter.  There is also a Lite compact version, which she favors for taking with her, as the size of the package is smaller and easier to slip into a pocket or purse.  If you put ease of use over cost then these are the tampons to buy. I highly suggest the Pearl versions for young girls."
40,40,20120228,B001LK6XHC,4,"February 28, 2012",A1R1BFJCMWX0Y3,I could do without the light ones,"While this is not my preferred brand, it was still nice since it was free and a good sized muli pack. I never use light so those just ended up in the trash. I fond of Kotex but would purchase this brand, but not this pack with the Super/Reg/Light"
124,124,20120126,B00284B59G,5,"January 26, 2012",A2CT6DUIFOI2TZ,Life saver for women after babies!,Tampax has finally made a tampon for women!!! Women tend to have heavier periods after having children. These are a life saver. It is the ONLY tampon that has complete protection and able to take the extra flow. This is the next step if S or SP do not work for you. They are wider than SP and probably hold 75% more. I am very happy with the the Ultra tampons. Everyone I have recommended them to have been very happy.
45,45,20111013,B001LK6XHC,5,"October 13, 2011",A1GNYV0RA0EQSS,DEPENDABLE!,"This is like writing a review for deodorant. What is it we are all looking for in personal protection?  An item that is secure and dependable. I have been using Tampax Pearls for years and I love the Triple Pack that gives you all three - light, regular and super absorbent. I stick by products that I believe in and I think you will agree that Tampax is the one that wins!"
3,3,20110628,B000GCNBOO,5,"June 28, 2011",A2PNAN94Q7P5FG,Travel size!,I bought this little box to keep in my camper.. I plan on buying more and keeping them in all my cars too.It is the perfect size to have as a back up!

107,107,20110320,B001LK6XI6,4,"March 20, 2011",A2RKSLYB423SSJ,Happy with the convenience and price of ordering on Amazon,"I bought these tampons through amazon because of the featured price and coupon.  The compact versions are always more convenient, but the function is the same. Packaging was easy and the product included coupons.  Thanks Amazon for making my life easier!"
4,4,20091101,B0013HOUPA,5,"November 1, 2009",AFR39NNSFWQ9R,Big saving,Nothing to complain about. Just good for those who use this product every month :)
158,158,20120329,B003CP13OM,5,"March 29, 2012",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,"No frills, just tampons","This is hands down an all around classic product that works superbly. Sure there are all the flashy new tampon types out there nowadays, with all their new \'technology\' and \'improvements\'  (and really, how much technology can go into a tampon?? It\'s cotton on a string afterall!) and all the flashy advertising, but I am always let down with a leak of some sort. This has been the only tampon that I can count on over the years. There are never any leaks, no wet strings - nothing to worry about at all.They do what they are supposed to do without any issues at all and they are cheap. You can fully dispose of the entire product, wrapper, applicator and all, by flushing it down the toilet. Cheap, efficient, reliable - what more could you want?"
122,122,20120315,B00284B59G,5,"March 15, 2012",A1NWZYC0G025HC,a gift from heaven,"When OB discontinued the ultra tampons, I was nervous I wouldn\'t be able to find a replacement.  These are them! In fact, they work better than the ultras. The only thing that I miss is the small size of the ultras but these still are so much better."
26,26,20110820,B001G7QV1I,4,"August 20, 2011",A1FQGF3LUM0HU3,What is there to say beyond great price?,"They\'re Tampax tampons. I\'m not going to get into the particulars, but they\'re the brand I\'ve always used, and likely always will use. The subscribe & save price is great and the shipping was amazingly fast."
75,75,20110904,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 4, 2011",A3TP31S61PPE3G,Regular and Super work great -- the light is an \'eh\' for me,I like the packaging on the tampons - they are easy to open and to dispose of. The plastic applicator makes it easy to insert as well. The regular and super work very well - with little to no leakage except on the heaviest of days. The light you should only use for VERY light days as it has a tendency to leak onto the string more even with a very light flow. These had no particular scent or odor control.Overall another excellent Tampax product. Just use the regular for the lighter flow until it gets very light.
109,109,20101211,B001LK6XI6,5,"December 11, 2010",A3ASUD6GJ4INMV,My tampon of choice.,"I wasn\'t planning to review this since I figured that ladies have found their own favorite brand via trial and error (not to mention it\'s a bit awkward to review tampons), but come on!  No reviews yet?- I really like this applicator. Since it\'s a \'pearl\'-like plastic, it slides in easily and comfortably. I also find that it\'s easy to grip the tip while pushing the tampon in. With other brands, I can\'t get a good grip and just end up pushing the whole darn thing in.- Regular is the way to go, I find; I don\'t like the bulk of bigger tampons.- I feel more comfortable with unscented products. Granted, I\'ve never tried a scented one, but... I don\'t think there should be any perfuming going on down there.So yup.  I\'m pretty loyal to these. Available pretty much everywhere, fortunately."

And why is it so hard to find cardboard applicators in Safeway? Oh well now that I know I can get them on Amazon I\'ll always get them here. Each plastic applicator will still be in this world way after you\'re long gone. Do you really need that? No you don\'t, so buy cardboard it works just as well!"

67,67,20110908,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 8, 2011",A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,Excellent and Superior To Regular Tampax!,"The Tampax Pearl tampons are the very best in my opinion of all the tampons with an applicator. Ok, well this is going to be a bit personal.  But what I like about these are they do easily glide in, they are not as long and weirdly shaped as regular Tampax and some other brands and they just \'fit\' better. Also, they expand properly in the width and absorb well, so I have not had any worries about leaking.  In addition, its a nice bonus that this pack comes with three different sizes to use as your flow changes. These are unscented- perfect for those of us who don\'t like those flowery perfumed scents. These are a tad pricey, but worth the cost in my opinion and I will deifnitely continue to use these."

I have a very heavy flow and even got frustrated using super plus tampons.  This hold a lot more and though at my heaviest times I still leak if I don\'t change soon enough, they still last longer than the super plus.  These are my favorite now, and I stock up on them!"
33,33,20120425,B001H9PUR6,5,"April 25, 2012",A3Q3ZOIIXVKWQF,great product and fast shipping,"3 days from order to UPS receipt at my door.  I have always had a problem buying feminine hygiene products from  the drug store or supermarket, especially in such a quantity. I just find it embarrassing, though it only makes sense to  buy in quantity something you know you will use and save money.Amazon and associated merchants have always been great.  Most of the time I have just bought books. But recently have been buying clothes as well as other products. And even with shipping costs find I can get things cheaper than at local stores.Only bad thing is these have plastic insertion. Not that good for the environment but sure makes insertion much easier."

59,59,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",AIIR8E34EDKCQ,One of the better brands out there,"Tampax Pearl is way better than regular Tampax tampons, the applicator no longer feels like a torture device and they work great at night or during day, I also appreciate the different sizes even though I don\'t usually need other than regular, they\'re good to share if you have sisters and friends and there\'s nothing more annoying than running out, so this is great for stocking up.Just remember not to flush the applicator, plastic doesn\'t do well in the septic system :P"
60,60,20110914,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 14, 2011",A3FBM0RMCMAABV,Love the convenience,"My favorite thing about this box is the different sizes.  I was so happy when Tampax started packaging their tampons this way because at different times throughout my cycle I use different sizes.  I think most women do this, and normally we\'d have to buy 3 different boxes.  This box makes it so convenient with all three sizes included.  I love the ease of use too.  Tampax is the only brand I\'ll use."

It saves  my wife the hassle of running out and the price was attractive.  From what I understand, they are as comfortable as could be expected considering. I have not noticed any spotting on the sheets or in the laundry so I would say this product is getting the job done! Stoked."

They are easy to insert, have a pleasant scent (I feel fresher on \'one of those days\' than normal), and they don\'t fall apart when you shove them deep into some compartment of your purse. I always feel happy opening the box and the wrapper, knowing I\'ll be all good every three to six hours, or as needed.Get the unscented if you have sensitivity to scented products."
140,140,20110308,B00284B59G,5,"March 8, 2011",A1AV2XXZB8CUPP,Great alternative to OB Ultra...,"Since OB has unfortunately stopped making their Ultra tampons, I was left with no choice but to find an alternative product (after YEARS of using OB).  After reading another review that referenced OB, I decided to give this brand a try.  As the other reviewer said, these are just as good as OB, and are a great alternative.  The shape is entirely different from OB  (sort of in the shape of a sting ray, once expanded), but still very absorbent and the thick braid string is a blessing. :) That is one major con about the OB ones, is that they only had a very small string, so it may not entirely be a bad thing that they stopped manufacturing them!Highly suggested for those seeking a replacement to OB\'s Ultra tampons!"
120,120,20120402,B00284B59G,1,"April 2, 2012",ATKTQFZSQLVSQ,New leak guard is awful,I have used this brand for many years. They rarely leaked and you could flush it all. Until now. The leak guard is SO irritating!!! I have thrown out two boxes and bought playtex. Someone didn\'t do their research. I can\'t seem to find new tampax without the leak guard \'skirt\' and so I won\'t be buying these until Tampax realizes that women do not need skirts on their tampons.
86,86,20110822,B001LK6XHC,4,"August 22, 2011",A17O9AHKHK66AI,Gold Standard for Protection,"This product offers the most reliable protection of any I have used.  It\'s also the easiest to use.  I wish it were made of organic, unbleached cotton and that the applicator were made of biodegradable plastic.  The unnecessarily harsh environmental impact of the product is why I rated it four stars instead of five and is also the reason I do not use these all the time.  However, if I am in a situation in which I would not otherwise be able to leave my house, this is the product on which I rely."

6,6,20120303,B001G7QJQA,3,"March 3, 2012",A1FOA1Q7IPJQ5,Never Again!,"I\'ve used Tampax tampons for years. About a year ago, I decided to try Kotex (not U by kotex.) I LOVE them. There comfortable and it feels like theres nothing there! SO I decided to try these one\'s out one day to see if they were pretty good as well. Well... There were some pro\'s and some con\'s.Pro\'s:the box is super colorfulthe wrapper holding the tampon was easy to use and cutethe applicator was cute- light blueI absoulty LOVE the fresh scent!!!!Con\'s:The tampon got wider, which was uncomfortable to take outand it felt like it was gonna fall out through out my whole period"
114,114,20110802,B00284B56Y,5,"August 2, 2011",APXFAU4THTNFJ,I love it,"As a previous reviewer stated, we all generally know what works for us. I decided to try compaks because the packaging is so much smaller and as a college student living in a dorm room, I need to save as much space as possible (and save money!). It\'s difficult to find these in bulk anywhere but of course Amazon had them! My packaging has a different design though. Instead of a purse, its a giant heart. Anyone who doesn\'t know these are tampons won\'t know looking at the box unless they look at the back where there\'s an image of the applicator. I know that\'s not a huge issue but if something can be functional AND attractive to look at, I am all for it."

With pads and \'super plus\' I actually stay at home for 5 days because the tampons and pads get demolished in 30 mins. God forbid I sit down and stand back up after 10 mins. I swear, it\'s like the super plus tampon isn\'t even there. I would have to carry a suitcase for the amount of changes I go though in a simple 8 hour day. Heck, this last \'adventure\' I didn\'t even bother to put on pants. My period literally stops my life. They used to be carried in the stores all over the place, and now, they have simply stopped carrying them anywhere in my local area. My pharmacy can\'t even order them for me.The tampons, I can count on to give me at least a couple of hours of safety, long enough to function somewhat moderately like a human being. After spending the last 5 hours hitting all my local stores looking, I came home and relied on my Amazon to save my day (sanity, et al, lol) once again.So very thankful that these are still in production."

Really, I see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for because the costs for feminine hygiene products are getting up there.  I never tried the Tampax Pearls because they are usually the most expensive box.  I thought I would give it a shot.  The applicator is very smooth and easy to insert unlike the cardboard applicators.  Obviously, this isn\'t good for the environment but I prefer these over the flushable applicators that usually clog my toilet.  The insert itself is comfortable enough.  I was skeptical of the braided string, however, I learned the hard way that the braid really does help with some leaks.  The issue I have, as I am sure many woman do, is the number of tampons included in each absorbancy.  I like the multipak idea but I am always left with a lot of one absorbancy over another."

I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."

I usually buy the 50-count box with cardboard applicators but thought I\'d finally give these Pearls a try.They are just as effective as what I am used to using. The only difference is the plastic applicator, which, honestly, does move things along more smoothly. However, for the money, there isn\'t enough of a difference between these two types to make me spring for the higher-priced version of tampon.I will say, though, that if you are just starting to use tampons, a plastic applicator might be more comfortable--and that would probably make paying a little extra money for the Pearls worthwhile."

Also, there\'s a leak guard braid that helps to catch those pesky and embarrassing leaks.  These tampons are also form-fitting and conforms to each individual\'s unique shape.There is a smooth rounded plastic tip for easy and comfortable insertion and the plastic applicator has an anti-slip grip.  Also the wrapper is almost cute and has easy to open tabs.The best thing about this product -- besides all the added protection now available to users -- is being available in a box of fifty.  There are ten tampons for light days, thirty for regular usage, and then the ten super duper size needed for those extra heavy moments.My daughter swears by this product and will purchase no other.  She is a first grade teacher and doesn\'t get many bathroom breaks and is constantly on her feet.  She doesn\'t have to worry about leaking problems, feels comfortable and secure, and can have every size necessary for whatever protection she is seeking.An A+ on this product.Thank you!Pam"

Not only that, but they are comfortable, affordable and come in a variety of absorbency strengths to be of use for all types of menstrual flow.Without these tampons I might have had to use a small towel or furry animal to soak up all the blood!Thanks Kotex!p.s. I have only one recommendation: I think that you should over a promotion or a coupon savings for customers who save all their used tampon applicators and send them in. Carbonated beverage companies do that for their cans, as well as some candy bar companies in respect to their wrappers. It is just a suggestion but I think it would be very beneficial for everyone."

With the boxes like this one that have several sizes/levels, though, I\'ve never had problems, and I really like how the three levels are available for the various points of your period.These are easy to use and insert, and comfortable.  The textured string also makes them easy to removed since they actually provide a good grip.The price on the 50-pack is also great, especially with Subscribe and Save; my local retailer charges about 1 1/2 times the cost that Amazon is charging.Overall, this is my favorite tampon, and I definitely recommend them."

What I have learned and was hoping to find info on before purchasing: They come with the applicator stick already in the tube and per instructions you have to pull it out till it clicks and then when inserting push it back in until it clicks. Great idea for making them take up less room and not get ruined in your pocket or purse. They are a little more flimsy then the regular ones so you have to be careful. Also, the first one the stick fell into the toilet. I have been careful with the rest, strategically holding them, but the rest have not really seemed as loose so it might have just been a fluke thing. They take a little getting used to and I haven\'t seen them in super plus yet, but I will continue to use them when I don\'t need the plus."

Well, that is what it seems to me.  They put perhaps 4 or 8 of these in the multi-packs and make the stand alone lights hard to find and in small quantities.  I find I use lots of Ultras the first part of the period, a bit of the super and regular absorbancy for a short time in the middle and then lots of lights at the very end.  So a multi-pack with mostly Regulars does not help me much.I have used these and the Pearl version and find they both work very similarly, except these are a bit more ego-friend;y with cardboard applicators.  I have to be honest, these are the only size I buy with cardboard, any other absorbancy is a bit uncomfortable for me.  I go through the most of these anyways and it takes a bit of the cost down.Why not get these in bulk?

I definitely prefer to buy cardboard over plastic. Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion."

For example, if I use one right before leaving the house, I feel confident that I can make it to my destination without having to RUSH to the nearest restroom or worry about \'accidents.\' Beware though, and don\'t get too overconfident in these. Especially during the early days, you still need to closely monitor yourself. BUT, these provide a lot more reassurance, and because you use fewer in the moderate to lighter days, you save money.

As women we have all probably figured out what our favorite brands are and what features we find best to suit our particular needs. I use light absorbency tampons which for some reason are rather difficult to find in retail stores, and when I do find them they are typically 2 times the price of others and there isn\'t ever a generic cheaper version. I purchased this 3 pack of 20 count tampons because there was a coupon offered at the time and with subscribe and save they ended up only being around 3 dollars a box. I have always liked the comfortable plastic applicator of the tampax \'pearl\' series, the compact style (1/2 the size of a regular applicator tampon) is such a wonderful feature, especially if carrying in your purse and they\'re small enough that you could inconspicuously tote one around in your pants pocket if need be. Just in case any of you aren\'t familiar with how the compact feature works...you remove the 1/2 sized tampon from the wrapper, hold the bottom textured part of the applicator, then simply pull out the base piece which will lock into place once completely pulled out (it aligns itself behind the cotton tampon inside) then viola you have a full sized tampon to use! Very convenient! I guess that\'s everything :) Reminder to you ladies out there...always remember to use the appropriate absorbency for your flow or you risk serious injury, even death form toxic shock. I believe they should sell light absorbency tampons more places instead of forcing women to use regular absorbency due to lack of availability...it\'s very dangerous and very serious...I had a friend that nearly died of TSS and it is a horrible thing to go through."

I somehow always got stains on my butt in school and every single person knew that I had my period lol. Super embarrassing... anyhow, thank god for tampons because I never had that problem ever again! I searched for the best tampon for about a week and finally got to these and never thought twice again, these are amazing. They are comfortable, easy to slide in, they absorb an amazing amount and I almost never even get a drip on my emergency pad/pantyliner. If you do not have heavy flow though I do not recommend these and they are pretty big compared to super and below. If you do have heavy for first days then they are perfect for that too and then just switch to a lighter absorbency when it gets towards the end of your period.

It feels so wasteful to use plastic so briefly and then toss it in the trash.  The plastic is made from oil, which keeps us dependent on other countries and pollutes the air, and then it lingers on in landfills or floats out to sea.  It was recently reported that whale carcasses washing up on California\'s beaches had plastic tampon applicators in their stomachs, among other debris.No, I think Tampax would do better to improve upon their cardboard applicators which at least can be sourced from recycled paperboard or from sustainably managed forests.

72,72,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",ALBW2ZBS6Z2AY,BEST TAMPONS EVER,"These are now my new favorites.I had previously tried a store brand version of the \' Pearl\' that was quite inferior, so be sure to get the real thing.The applicator has a nice shape, the braided part of the string prevents leaks, and unlike many tampons, the absorbency is not exaggerated.I also like the combination of 3 different sizes in this box, which is quite large and will keep you prepared for at  least several months.A product with no drawbacks that I sincerely recommend."
69,69,20110908,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 8, 2011",A38MQHVEICK46P,Great Product,"I love this product!  Feminine hygiene isn\'t exactly a topic that is often discussed, but I just wanted to cast my vote for Tampax Pearl.  They are comfortable, easy to use, and offer great protection.  I won\'t use the generic brand as these are worth the extra cost.  I think they are a great value."
68,68,20110908,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 8, 2011",A2GK5S3ZF9Y8YO,The only tampons I use,"I have been a loyal Tampax Pearl customer since I discovered these tampons a few years ago. They go in very easily, and I\'ve never had the problems with them falling out that some other reviewers have mentioned. For someone who has a heavy flow (as I do), this multipack won\'t cover all of your needs, but this one box should last a long time. I usually buy this multipack plus another box of Supers and a box of Super Plus, and I\'m set for several months. I\'ve tried Playtex Gentle Glide and Kotex U, but I keep coming back to Tampax Pearl--I simply haven\'t found a better tampon!"

112,112,20111223,B00284B56Y,5,"December 23, 2011",A32HBY12NEPGVK,Love these,"The tampons are the best I have ever used.  I like that they are compact and I can fit more in my purse.  To me they are also more comfortable to wear than the normal sized tampons.  I think the tampon itself is slightly shorter in length, but it still has the same absorbency.  The only drawback would be that the wrapper is very noisy."

Enough that I broke through a Super Plus tampon onto a full-sized pad every 1-2 hours for about one day. I tried the Tampax Pearl Ultra as a sample and have been buying them ever since, they are great! They have given me the freedom again not to be tied to the nearest bathroom. It is also great being able to order them from Amazon since not many retailers carry them in my area. Don\'t forget to see if there is an Amazon coupon. I got an additional discount both times I ordered from Amazon. Thank you Tampax. Thank you Amazon."

137,137,20110517,B00284B59G,5,"May 17, 2011",AJ115DYP2FDVH,Change your life!,"These really will change your life! At least for the week or so each month you\'re on your period, like me, so about a 1/4 of your life!! Now, given, I only use them for a couple, maybe three days, but no more leaking after one hour, two, or even three! And, amazingly, they seem to be a better shape than the super (orange) pearls, so hold better and feel better, too. I used these for the first time in when I found them in Colorado and was thrilled. But, for the life of me, couldn\'t find them in California where I live (what, do the CA buyers think it\'s an \'altitude\' thing? CA buyers, get w/ the program!). Though I am not a regular Amazon shopper, I stumbled upon them and was thrilled at a good price, and TWO boxes. (trust me, you\'ll want two. Who wants to run out?) I hope other ladies who try them are as happy as I have been with the results. Don\'t ditch the liner or pad yet, but don\'t panic after 45 minutes either. Good luck!"
77,77,20110902,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 2, 2011",A3EI4K5U61UZ7,Great variety pack,"Great variety pack for those periods when flow varies.  The plastic applicator is more comfortable to use than the cardboard, however it is obviously not as biodegradable.  The unscented variety is good for those with sensitivity to perfumes."
57,57,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",A383XURHVF8ON6,This is what I always buy and use,"I\'ve always bought and used these Tampax Pearl tampons.  Most often I use the Regular absorbency, and rarely the Super.  I\'m on Yasmin which has significantly lessened my period flow, so I occasionally use the Light absorbency too.Cons:1.  Umm... let\'s see.... well, because the applicator is made of plastic, they\'re not the cardboard biodegradable sort of tampon applicator.  However, see my list of pros why this can be a good thing.Pros:1.  The applicator is made of smooth plastic, but with \'Anti-Slip Grip\' - ridges on the part of the applicator where you hold it when putting it in, so you have a better grip.  The last time I used tampons with cardboard applicators, they got slippery as heck when inserting them, so much that they were rendered unusable.  So, these Tampax Pearl tampons are far better in that regard.2.  These are unscented - fragrances in a tampon can cause irritation, so I\'ve always used unscented.3.  Easy to insert, and I don\'t feel them at all once they\'re in.  I will forget that I have a tampon in.4.  They\'ve never leaked, and I\'ll wear each tampon for a full 8-9 hours.  These tampons work.  Period.  HA!  Get it?  Yep, I\'m a dork.5.  The wrapper is super quiet.I do have to say, another reviewer said these tampons \'worked their way out\'... I don\'t know how this could happen.  Perhaps not inserting them far enough?  I put them in as far as they can go, and they\'ve never worked their way out."

It is all about convenience, it allows me to grab the right size for the right day. I don\'t have a problem with *cough* insertion (please, take a big sip of coffee). I just love that it gives my wallet a rest and I don\'t have to buy separate packs. And also, we all get stressed out, hormones change, and we tend to not even realize that what started out as a heavy period has lightened up quite a bit before its over and we don\'t need to use one for heavy absorbency."
90,90,20110115,B001LK6XHC,5,"January 15, 2011",A21V0ZJE1UWI3A,love it!!,I myself have a gradual period and I don\'t know any other woman who doesn\'t. It\'s a great idea to include 3 different flow sizes in one box. Great!!
126,126,20111228,B00284B59G,5,"December 28, 2011",A2TSGCYUT950YD,Perfect if you have a heavy flow,"These hold up for about five hours on my heaviest days; with the super-plus, I bleed through after 2-3 hours, tops. I had never heard of ultra-absorbency tampons, let alone seen any in stores in my area, so I was glad to find these as an \'also bought\' item on amazon.com when I searched for Tampax super-plus. After trying these, I can say I\'m a customer until menopause. I have never, ever sprung a leak with these. Don\'t hesitate to buy these if you bleed heavily - as of right now, there is no other Ultra tampon on the market."
15,15,20110604,B001G7QKAA,1,"June 4, 2011",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,Not so good at all,"It is hard to write a review for tampons without sounding gross, but I will try..I do not like these tampons at all. They seem to try to slip out constantly after an hour or two and I have NEVER experienced that with any tampon in my life. I am 34 years old, so I have been using tampons - many different brands and varieties for 20 years now. This has got to be the worst I have ever used.They always seem to allow leakage as well. This is not from leaving them in too long, or due to extra heavy flow. They just leak, period (no pun intended!!).I ordered these in Super Absorbency from Amazon since they had such a dirt cheap price for the 2 boxes. I did use up both boxes just so I didn\'t feel like I wasted my money, but I will never buy them again. I had the same terrible results with both boxes.I cannot imagine using them if you have extra heavy or heavy flow."
52,52,20110923,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 23, 2011",A1IW1ANBV0DPVI,Best Tampons Out There,"I LOVE Tampax Pearl\'s - so many other brands try to duplicate this product but they just don\'t get it exactly right - the durable, strong wrappers that can hold up in any crowded bag, the ergonomic applicators w/ no slip grips on the sides, the super absorbant cord - they\'re the best, love these tampons, and I love these assorted packs - it keeps you from having to buy a separate box for heavier or lighter days - what a great way to save some coins."
150,150,20111002,B0029NYQQA,2,"October 2, 2011",A1ZG9I0TYI0K27,Unsatisfactory,Seemed like a great deal but these tampons are really difficult to put out of the container. This is my main problem with this product. i\'ve had better luck with even generic tampon brands.
