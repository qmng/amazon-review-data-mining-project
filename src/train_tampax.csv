It saves  my wife the hassle of running out and the price was attractive.  From what I understand, they are as comfortable as could be expected considering. I have not noticed any spotting on the sheets or in the laundry so I would say this product is getting the job done! Stoked."
60,60,20110914,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 14, 2011",A3FBM0RMCMAABV,Love the convenience,"My favorite thing about this box is the different sizes.  I was so happy when Tampax started packaging their tampons this way because at different times throughout my cycle I use different sizes.  I think most women do this, and normally we\'d have to buy 3 different boxes.  This box makes it so convenient with all three sizes included.  I love the ease of use too.  Tampax is the only brand I\'ll use."

I\'m not going to get into the particulars, but they\'re the brand I\'ve always used, and likely always will use. The subscribe & save price is great and the shipping was amazingly fast."
17,17,20110708,B001G7QRG2,5,"July 8, 2011",A2QNHF6YQIU82P,Tampax lites,I ordered the tampons from Amazon because it was cheaper than buying them in the store and they came right to my door for free.  Sweet!
108,108,20110318,B001LK6XI6,2,"March 18, 2011",A27A83F6FXWX6V,Performs Well but Trashes Environment,"I tried the sample Tampax Pearl tampons included with a box of their regular cardboard applicator tampons.  I had no problem with the performance of the tampon (although it was a bit more difficult to use), but I\'m quite bothered by the production and disposal of this product.  It feels so wasteful to use plastic so briefly and then toss it in the trash.  The plastic is made from oil, which keeps us dependent on other countries and pollutes the air, and then it lingers on in landfills or floats out to sea.  It was recently reported that whale carcasses washing up on California\'s beaches had plastic tampon applicators in their stomachs, among other debris.No, I think Tampax would do better to improve upon their cardboard applicators which at least can be sourced from recycled paperboard or from sustainably managed forests.  Or perhaps I\'ll forgo the applicator all together and just use o.b. tampons."
51,51,20110924,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 24, 2011",A2OJCTT5WLB2HR,Hmm... How to review tampons...,"This should be a fun review.Over the years, I was not a big fan of Tampax tampons because the style made them get longer instead of wider once they started absorbing.  They changed that design with Tampax Pearl and now I really like them.  I loved the large pack with many different sizes and felt that the number of each size was quite good.  I had no issues with the size of the tampons or absorbency and found them to be comfortable and effective which is really about all I can ask of a tampon!"
13,13,20111128,B001G7QJRE,5,"November 28, 2011",A104W89DPJBJZF,Such a great deal,I am doing the subscribe and save and this is such a great deal. i get double the amount of tampons at half the price - these are the kind i normally buy in the store for ONE box for 10 dollars...
154,154,20101222,B0029NYQQA,4,"December 22, 2010",A3PKIEHWSWN4JF,These are good...,"They do take some getting used to. You must click it to get it right. Although, dont expect to hear a click more like feel it with your fingers. You dont have to push it in until you hear the click either. If its in all the way just pull out the barrel like you would do a normal Tampon. These are really small & cute. The boxes are discreet. The first few times you might leak a little bit but once you get the hang of using these, it will be alright. As every woman knows, you can always wear a little pad to help with the leaks. =)"

68,68,20110908,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 8, 2011",A2GK5S3ZF9Y8YO,The only tampons I use,"I have been a loyal Tampax Pearl customer since I discovered these tampons a few years ago. They go in very easily, and I\'ve never had the problems with them falling out that some other reviewers have mentioned. For someone who has a heavy flow (as I do), this multipack won\'t cover all of your needs, but this one box should last a long time. I usually buy this multipack plus another box of Supers and a box of Super Plus, and I\'m set for several months. I\'ve tried Playtex Gentle Glide and Kotex U, but I keep coming back to Tampax Pearl--I simply haven\'t found a better tampon!"
141,141,20110214,B00284B59G,5,"February 14, 2011",AT8WMUMV6EAB6,Lifesaver for heavy flow,I can\'t seem to find these in stores near me - so greatful that I can get them through amazon.  They are the only product that lets me sleep through the night.
57,57,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",A383XURHVF8ON6,This is what I always buy and use,"I\'ve always bought and used these Tampax Pearl tampons.  Most often I use the Regular absorbency, and rarely the Super.  I\'m on Yasmin which has significantly lessened my period flow, so I occasionally use the Light absorbency too.Cons:1.  Umm... let\'s see.... well, because the applicator is made of plastic, they\'re not the cardboard biodegradable sort of tampon applicator.  However, see my list of pros why this can be a good thing.Pros:1.  The applicator is made of smooth plastic, but with \'Anti-Slip Grip\' - ridges on the part of the applicator where you hold it when putting it in, so you have a better grip.  The last time I used tampons with cardboard applicators, they got slippery as heck when inserting them, so much that they were rendered unusable.  So, these Tampax Pearl tampons are far better in that regard.2.  These are unscented - fragrances in a tampon can cause irritation, so I\'ve always used unscented.3.  Easy to insert, and I don\'t feel them at all once they\'re in.  I will forget that I have a tampon in.4.  They\'ve never leaked, and I\'ll wear each tampon for a full 8-9 hours.  These tampons work.  Period.  HA!  Get it?  Yep, I\'m a dork.5.  The wrapper is super quiet.I do have to say, another reviewer said these tampons \'worked their way out\'... I don\'t know how this could happen.  Perhaps not inserting them far enough?  I put them in as far as they can go, and they\'ve never worked their way out."
32,32,20090517,B001H99ZCC,1,"May 17, 2009",A3U1VH6NJMLJLE,Sometimes Change is Not Good,"After faithfully using this product for 34 years, Tampax went and changed both the applicator and the tampon itself.  The applicator change was good...the tampon change was not.  I have never had so many problems as I do with this new version.  And, the price paid here was $6 higher than at Costco.  These I will donate to a women\'s shelter. My quest for either older versions of the product or a different brand that works continues."
103,103,20110803,B001LK6XI6,4,"August 3, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Good tampons but wouldn\'t buy on a regular basis,"In general, these are good tampons, easy to insert and comfortable. I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."

The compact versions are always more convenient, but the function is the same. Packaging was easy and the product included coupons.  Thanks Amazon for making my life easier!"
97,97,20120327,B001LK6XI6,1,"March 27, 2012",A1ZSP4WXA7DK97,why charge more than what i signed up for????,I AM NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT I AM BEEN CHARGE FOR THIS TAMPAX THE PRICE I ALWAYS PAY $7.32 OR NO MORE THAN $8.00 AND THIS TIME I AM BEEN CHARGE $10.17 THAT IS NOT THE PRICE THAT I SIGNED UP FOR THE AUTOMATIC SHIPMENT EVERY 3 MONTHS I DON\'T WANT THIS ITEM UNLESS IS THE PRICE THAT I WAS SIGN UP FOR. I SHOULD BE TOLD THE PRICE WENT UP BEFORE IT IS SHIPPED.

They DO What They Are Ment To Do!,"The Tampax Pearl tampons do what they are intended to do.I have tried many brands of tampons over the years, they are NOT all created equal and Tampax  are a great brand and it has been a regular brand that I use! Do not have to worry about accidents! They come in a handy variety box.The plasic applicator makes them more comfortable to use and the only type I will use!"

1,1,20041127,B0000VCZ70,5,"November 27, 2004",A2PA01OKPQ704D,Tampax is great,"It looks to me like the reviewer from England didn\'t actually purchase the tampons, it\'s just someone who has a grudge against tampons in general and Tampax in particular.  I have used Tampax for years and have never had any pain or health problems from their usage, and I will continue to use them till I no longer have a need for them.  Not only that, but the price for a box of 100 is excellent."
41,41,20120216,B001LK6XHC,4,"February 16, 2012",AGBFIQMV9L61Y,I\'ll stick with cardboard applicators.,"Tampax tampons are my go-to brand. I usually buy the 50-count box with cardboard applicators but thought I\'d finally give these Pearls a try.They are just as effective as what I am used to using. The only difference is the plastic applicator, which, honestly, does move things along more smoothly. However, for the money, there isn\'t enough of a difference between these two types to make me spring for the higher-priced version of tampon.I will say, though, that if you are just starting to use tampons, a plastic applicator might be more comfortable--and that would probably make paying a little extra money for the Pearls worthwhile."
146,146,20081214,B00289683Y,1,"December 14, 2008",APN675GC3H0P8,New and not improved,"Tampax has added the wings and 3-way protection to all of their lines. The widening of the tampons makes removal uncomfortable and I did not notice any improvement in leak guard. Once a trusted name now quite uncomfortable, not a characteristic you want in a tampon."
37,37,20090407,B001K3IH06,5,"April 7, 2009",A1JTQCIL88W9JV,Hard to find item delivered to your door,"At the grocery or drugstore it is hard to find a box of \'slender\' only. Usually they are mixed in an assortment. For those with young daughters who want to avoid the whole pad thing, this is a great starter size. It is actually a regular, that has been slimmed down to an easier size for rookies. So pleased that Amazon stocks this item."
79,79,20110901,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 1, 2011",A36AIK1DQPSRNT,***A FAV PERSONAL PRODUCT****,"These are my favorites.  The assorted absorbency is a great idea, the plastic applicator allows for ease of use, and the large amount, at least in my case, means that they will last a while.  Not much more to say about a product like this and have it remain a rated G review!DYB"
163,163,20110925,B003CP13VU,5,"September 25, 2011",A1GXOPZRE5P0EL,Plastic lasts forever so I\'m glad these are cardboard!,"Plastic lasts forever so I\'m glad these are cardboard! And why is it so hard to find cardboard applicators in Safeway? Oh well now that I know I can get them on Amazon I\'ll always get them here. Each plastic applicator will still be in this world way after you\'re long gone. Do you really need that? No you don\'t, so buy cardboard it works just as well!"
104,104,20110617,B001LK6XI6,5,"June 17, 2011",AOY1BUICNSYYK,Perfect,"I normally use the Super Tampax Pearl at the beginning, however i find these to work better later on during my period. Like all other Tampax Pearl the string is what makes this product amazing, since it prevents leaking. The applicator is also amazing, easy to hold and MUCH easier to use than the paper cardboard ones.I myself prefer the unscented version, since the scented smells a bit too strong and chemically."
126,126,20111228,B00284B59G,5,"December 28, 2011",A2TSGCYUT950YD,Perfect if you have a heavy flow,"These hold up for about five hours on my heaviest days; with the super-plus, I bleed through after 2-3 hours, tops. I had never heard of ultra-absorbency tampons, let alone seen any in stores in my area, so I was glad to find these as an \'also bought\' item on amazon.com when I searched for Tampax super-plus. After trying these, I can say I\'m a customer until menopause. I have never, ever sprung a leak with these. Don\'t hesitate to buy these if you bleed heavily - as of right now, there is no other Ultra tampon on the market."
118,118,20120427,B00284B59G,5,"April 27, 2012",AYVG53NPDAIHU,Why did stores ever stop carrying this product?,"It\'s like....they think women that experience a heavy period don\'t exist or something. With pads and \'super plus\' I actually stay at home for 5 days because the tampons and pads get demolished in 30 mins. God forbid I sit down and stand back up after 10 mins. I swear, it\'s like the super plus tampon isn\'t even there. I would have to carry a suitcase for the amount of changes I go though in a simple 8 hour day. Heck, this last \'adventure\' I didn\'t even bother to put on pants. My period literally stops my life. They used to be carried in the stores all over the place, and now, they have simply stopped carrying them anywhere in my local area. My pharmacy can\'t even order them for me.The tampons, I can count on to give me at least a couple of hours of safety, long enough to function somewhat moderately like a human being. After spending the last 5 hours hitting all my local stores looking, I came home and relied on my Amazon to save my day (sanity, et al, lol) once again.So very thankful that these are still in production."
144,144,20100419,B0028916CC,5,"April 19, 2010",A2NKP3E5F90VFT,Almost Too Good,"As the box states, these are ULTRA absorbent. With the exception of the first 24 hours of my cycle, with these, I don\'t need to change as often. I feel \'ultra\' secure with these. For example, if I use one right before leaving the house, I feel confident that I can make it to my destination without having to RUSH to the nearest restroom or worry about \'accidents.\' Beware though, and don\'t get too overconfident in these. Especially during the early days, you still need to closely monitor yourself. BUT, these provide a lot more reassurance, and because you use fewer in the moderate to lighter days, you save money. They\'re really the only level of protection needed."
21,21,20100831,B001G7QV18,5,"August 31, 2010",A128RU4O72TIN7,Convenient 2 pack and good price for the amount,Decided to buy the 100 count boxes because I know I\'m definitely going to use them. They end up being cheaper to buy then getting the smaller packs available at my local stores. It\'s also more convenient to have them available and I don\'t have to remember to buy another box every so often. I prefer the cardboard instead of the Tampax pearl because they can be flushed down the toilet and are biodegradable. I have used both and they work just as well.
148,148,20111212,B0029NYQOW,4,"December 12, 2011",A3LPH0J4L9BEJY,They\'re Tampons,"My wife seems to like them and I don\'t have to cart them around at a retail store.What\'s more, the price is right with the \'subscribe and save\' discount.  Just keep them in the saved-for-later part of your cart to monitor the price as your refill date approaches (or manually control the subscription deliveries)."

No idea how I got started buying the Playtex brand, but I\'ve stuck to it for about 12 years now. I was open to trying Pearl because a) the Tampax name is a good one, b) I love the idea of Pearl- the word just sounds nice and comfortable, and c) How different can tampons be, anyway?These tampons weren\'t bad, but they also weren\'t quite as comfortable as my regular Playtex (Gentle Glide, in case you\'re wondering). They seemed a little cheaper and the actual tampon definitely wasn\'t as sturdy and ended up actually falling apart a bit.Oh, but I am a fan of the super to easy open packaging. I just don\'t think I\'d replace my Playtex for these.And this is officially the most awkward Amazon review I\'ve written...."

That being said, my wife only uses these.  I can really only review the packaging here, which is probably what you want to know about.  It\'s a multi-pack, containing 10 light and 10 super, and 30 of the regular size tampons.  It\'s a great assortment and last several cycles.  The price, as is usual around here, is excellent.

They seem to try to slip out constantly after an hour or two and I have NEVER experienced that with any tampon in my life. I am 34 years old, so I have been using tampons - many different brands and varieties for 20 years now. This has got to be the worst I have ever used.They always seem to allow leakage as well. This is not from leaving them in too long, or due to extra heavy flow. They just leak, period (no pun intended!!).I ordered these in Super Absorbency from Amazon since they had such a dirt cheap price for the 2 boxes. I did use up both boxes just so I didn\'t feel like I wasted my money, but I will never buy them again. I had the same terrible results with both boxes.I cannot imagine using them if you have extra heavy or heavy flow."

Well, that is what it seems to me.  They put perhaps 4 or 8 of these in the multi-packs and make the stand alone lights hard to find and in small quantities.  I find I use lots of Ultras the first part of the period, a bit of the super and regular absorbancy for a short time in the middle and then lots of lights at the very end.  So a multi-pack with mostly Regulars does not help me much.I have used these and the Pearl version and find they both work very similarly, except these are a bit more ego-friend;y with cardboard applicators.  I have to be honest, these are the only size I buy with cardboard, any other absorbancy is a bit uncomfortable for me.  I go through the most of these anyways and it takes a bit of the cost down.Why not get these in bulk?  I always say, if you will need it anyways and it doesn\'t expire, get a bunch at a great price and be prepared!"

What I have learned and was hoping to find info on before purchasing: They come with the applicator stick already in the tube and per instructions you have to pull it out till it clicks and then when inserting push it back in until it clicks. Great idea for making them take up less room and not get ruined in your pocket or purse. They are a little more flimsy then the regular ones so you have to be careful. Also, the first one the stick fell into the toilet. I have been careful with the rest, strategically holding them, but the rest have not really seemed as loose so it might have just been a fluke thing. They take a little getting used to and I haven\'t seen them in super plus yet, but I will continue to use them when I don\'t need the plus."

Amazon\'s price was better than I can get in the grocery store, plus they don\'t always have this size available there.  I also got free shipping, so I had nothing to lose."

I love the smooth plastic applicator but I too had a problem with these staying put.  I guess they are too smooth for me.  I have a heavy flow the first few days so I tried the super size first.  I had to wear a pad with it to contain the leaks.  I recently tried the OB brand super size and they are perfect for my heavy flow days.  They do not fall out and they contain the leaks like no other.  I did use this multipack for my lighter days and got by with just a pantiliner but I can not get past having them fall out when I go to relieve myself.  I do not like having tampons in my septic system and I do not want to have to fish them out.  I have had two children so maybe these would have worked better prior to childbirth.

I\'ve tried many different brands/types but Tampax Pearl always comes out on top. The plastic applicators are much more comfortable to use than the cardboard applicators many other brands use. I love the multi-pack because I can choose which absorbancy will suit me best for that day without having to buy 3 separate boxes. I\'ve had problems with other tampons not fully opening up and absorbing like they are supposed to, but I\'ve never had a problem with these (or a leak!). I would definitely recommend that if you haven\'t tried these already, you should. You won\'t regret it."

I used the \'Super\' ones (which are the biggest in this pack) and within an hour or so, they had just kinda worked their way out. Since the \'Super\' ones weren\'t cutting it, I know there\'s no way I can even try the smaller ones. Sadly, this box will be a waste for me.I do like the plastic applicator however.

I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."

It\'s difficult to find these in bulk anywhere but of course Amazon had them! My packaging has a different design though. Instead of a purse, its a giant heart. Anyone who doesn\'t know these are tampons won\'t know looking at the box unless they look at the back where there\'s an image of the applicator. I know that\'s not a huge issue but if something can be functional AND attractive to look at, I am all for it."

I\'m hoping that in the future Tampax tries to incorporate that more into this product.Tampax Pearl tampons are the most comfortable and easy to use tampons out there.

I know it\'s a matter of preference but in terms of comfort I have no idea why someone would elect cardboard over plastic, but that\'s just me.The price of these on Amazon is great, especially with the Subscribe & Save program.  It\'s a perfect deal.  I only wish that they made a 50 count pack of regular & super without the light ones as I never need those."

I just love that it gives my wallet a rest and I don\'t have to buy separate packs.

I have only one recommendation: I think that you should over a promotion or a coupon savings for customers who save all their used tampon applicators and send them in. Carbonated beverage companies do that for their cans, as well as some candy bar companies in respect to their wrappers. It is just a suggestion but I think it would be very beneficial for everyone."

Once you click them open (which takes about one second - if you can click a ballpoint pen, you can do this) they are exactly like every other tampon, and you just insert them as normal.Another great thing about these tampons is the packaging. The external package (the part that says \'Tampax Compak Pearl\') contains four boxes of 10 tampons each: one purple box of 10 lites, two yellow boxes of 10 regulars, and one green box of 10 supers. The color-coded boxes are very discreet; they are just pretty patterns with no words printed on them at all.

Does not light up, and is not magnetic enough.  Does not vibrate like my other four.  Also, my biggest problem has been smell.  Men run.  Run like my cat when he got out of the mattress.  Will not recommend to uncle."
71,71,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A2RX62V4E2BF5Z,I\'ll always be a Tampax Girl,"Tampax has always been my first choice tampon. I normally go with the normal Tampax, not the Pearl line. There are a few \'upgrades\' with the Pearl line, in addition to the quality and protection you know and trust from Tampax.Instead of the traditional paper wrap, these are in an easy to open plastic wrap. Tampax calls these purse-friendly, and indeed they are. We\'ve all found that torn open, slightly disassembled tampon at the bottom of our purse. You won\'t have that problem with the Pearl line. The multi-pack, for me, always runs out of mediums and leaves me with only the barely useful light and the super absorbency is just scary big.The blunt cardboard applicator has been replaced with a \'smooth plastic applicator and rounded tip for comfortable insertion\'. I won\'t say you can\'t tell the difference, but chances are you won\'t care. The difference is so insignificant that I don\'t find it worth the additional cost, both financially and to the environment. That is pretty much the story of the Pearl line. Like with the absorbent braid, I don\'t koow that the ever so slight amount of additional protection will ever, in your life, make even the slightest difference.The Pearl line, like the normal Tampax line, is great. For me, I\'ll stick with the less expensive, paper wrapped, cardboard applicators. BUT, if the added feature seem like they would make a difference to you, then go for Pearl."

How women can deal with using this CARDBOARD today in 2012, knowing that the plastic applicator exists & is sooooo much more COMFORTABLE is beyond me. It did give good protection though(no leaks) But I just can\'t..."
129,129,20111025,B00284B59G,5,"October 25, 2011",AUFB3GQJV10P0,Award winner,After I could no longer find OB Ultra I went to this.  I was curious because Tampax never made an Ultra before and I was panicked because I have Fibroids and need these tampons.  Tampax Ultra is just superb and I bought a two pack of 36 before and this is my second order. You can\'t even find a 36 count in the stores in NYC.  At least I\'ve never spotted them only in 18 count and expensive.  I get a bargain through Amazon.  This is my lifeling purchase.
96,96,20120405,B001LK6XI6,5,"April 5, 2012",AHUJB9FTS71RE,Great,"What I love about these:- Not too drying- Just the right size- Right amount of absorbency- Applicator is easy.I wish I didn\'t have to buy these, of course, but since I do, I am glad to have these as an option!"
131,131,20110903,B00284B59G,5,"September 3, 2011",A3MXTBZ38QCDJK,Yahoo!,"I was so glad to see these!! Finally something to make you feel more comfortable! Super plus are good but often you want more protection just in case if you are at work or in public and can\'t run to the bathroom every hour! Are these new? I haven\'t seen them before, I tried them for the very first time about 2 weeks ago. So glad Tampax developed these! Thank you! Highly recommended."

120,120,20120402,B00284B59G,1,"April 2, 2012",ATKTQFZSQLVSQ,New leak guard is awful,I have used this brand for many years. They rarely leaked and you could flush it all. Until now. The leak guard is SO irritating!!! I have thrown out two boxes and bought playtex. Someone didn\'t do their research. I can\'t seem to find new tampax without the leak guard \'skirt\' and so I won\'t be buying these until Tampax realizes that women do not need skirts on their tampons.
109,109,20101211,B001LK6XI6,5,"December 11, 2010",A3ASUD6GJ4INMV,My tampon of choice.,"I wasn\'t planning to review this since I figured that ladies have found their own favorite brand via trial and error (not to mention it\'s a bit awkward to review tampons), but come on!  No reviews yet?- I really like this applicator. Since it\'s a \'pearl\'-like plastic, it slides in easily and comfortably. I also find that it\'s easy to grip the tip while pushing the tampon in. With other brands, I can\'t get a good grip and just end up pushing the whole darn thing in.- Regular is the way to go, I find; I don\'t like the bulk of bigger tampons.- I feel more comfortable with unscented products. Granted, I\'ve never tried a scented one, but... I don\'t think there should be any perfuming going on down there.So yup.  I\'m pretty loyal to these. Available pretty much everywhere, fortunately."

The size and absorbency seems to be comparable, and I am able to make it through the night with these.  I am sad to be putting the plastic of the applicator into the landfill, but happy that I know I\'m 46 and only have a few years to go.  I do miss the convenience of being able to put the ob\'s in my pocket.  Hopefully someone will see the need of a tampon like the ob ultra."
86,86,20110822,B001LK6XHC,4,"August 22, 2011",A17O9AHKHK66AI,Gold Standard for Protection,"This product offers the most reliable protection of any I have used.  It\'s also the easiest to use.  I wish it were made of organic, unbleached cotton and that the applicator were made of biodegradable plastic.  The unnecessarily harsh environmental impact of the product is why I rated it four stars instead of five and is also the reason I do not use these all the time.  However, if I am in a situation in which I would not otherwise be able to leave my house, this is the product on which I rely."
75,75,20110904,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 4, 2011",A3TP31S61PPE3G,Regular and Super work great -- the light is an \'eh\' for me,I like the packaging on the tampons - they are easy to open and to dispose of. The plastic applicator makes it easy to insert as well. The regular and super work very well - with little to no leakage except on the heaviest of days. The light you should only use for VERY light days as it has a tendency to leak onto the string more even with a very light flow. These had no particular scent or odor control.Overall another excellent Tampax product. Just use the regular for the lighter flow until it gets very light.
20,20,20110324,B001G7QV18,5,"March 24, 2011",AZA595ZPIG240,Many To Last,I bought this for my girlfriend. Instead of going to local market. I am buying this in bulk online to SAVE TIME AND MONEY.
