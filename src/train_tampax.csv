163,163,20110925,B003CP13VU,5,"September 25, 2011",A1GXOPZRE5P0EL,Plastic lasts forever so I\'m glad these are cardboard!,"Plastic lasts forever so I\'m glad these are cardboard! And why is it so hard to find cardboard applicators in Safeway? Oh well now that I know I can get them on Amazon I\'ll always get them here. Each plastic applicator will still be in this world way after you\'re long gone. Do you really need that? No you don\'t, so buy cardboard it works just as well!"

So until now, my favorite brand it has been O.B. After trying Tampax Pearl Plastic, I\'m switching brands. I like the comfortable plastic applicator more, and Tampax Pearl are a snug and absorbent fit. I like the size assortment in this box, but  I will buy a box of Tampax Pearl Super Absorbency for the heavy days, and keep these for the days where my period fluctuates."

The plastic makes them easier to insert (also buy her some lubricant and have her stand up with her foot up on the toilet or even higher ).  The \'lip\' at the edge of the tampon makes it easier to grip as well. The LITES are smaller and easier for a young girl to use. The small size and individual wrapping makes them easy to put in a pocket.Use your own judgement to make sure that she is mature enough to remember to remove them at regular intervals.  But if she participates in sports/swimming/dance having this option is invaluable so that she can participate in her normal activities.
125,125,20111230,B00284B59G,4,"December 30, 2011",A2UQEX65M8CS6U,Really works for extra heavy flow days,Used these on day 2 and day 3 and was able to wear white uniform pants.  I definitely recommend these to anyone who needs extra protection.

I\'m not going to get into the particulars, but they\'re the brand I\'ve always used, and likely always will use. The subscribe & save price is great and the shipping was amazingly fast."
65,65,20110911,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 11, 2011",AX7QMRXX81L9K,"Good product, flawed idea","When Tampax came out with these variety boxes, I wondered how it would work, if the numbers of each type of tampons would work out.  For me, the numbers don\'t work.  You can\'t predict how many of each type you\'ll need each month and I find myself using one that\'s not quite right just because it\'s all I have or because I have too many of one kind and am trying to finish them up.  That being said, I\'ve used Tampax for years and the product is great.  I\'ll stick with buying separate boxes with different absorbancies as needed."

But this is a reliable product from brand I\'ve trusted for many years.  As a woman who has tried nearly every brand out there, I can honestly say I do prefer Tampax over its competitors.  I have never bought a multi-box before and this is somewhat convenient, but I will probably buy refills of my needed size next time.  The plastic applicators are much more comfortable and easier to use than cardboard.  The wrappers are sturdy enough to survive in my purse as well."
27,27,20100609,B001G7QV1I,2,"June 9, 2010",A1L8X5TUG6TIWX,An unnecessary new design ruined Tampax.,"I picked up a box assuming that this would be the same product I first tried several years ago... These are the worst tampons I\'ve used. You feel them after insertion. I kept going back to the bathroom because I felt like I needed to readjust. It never seemed to help. Very uncomfortable! Reviewers on drugstore.com have claimed that these actually gave them cramps. Ouch! The cardboard applicators, while being easier to manipulate than the nightmarish Playtex Beyond, can still be difficult. And I\'ve been flushing them with some apprehension even though the box says it\'s okay. Bad, bad, bad. They really effed up a classic brand here. Tampax tampons are inferior to just about every other tampon available now.Pearl is the only Tampax style worth considering...and even then there are cheaper and better tampons, such as Kotex Security, Playtex Gentle Glide, and Playtex Sport.I would only buy these again if absolutely nothing else were available to me."
85,85,20110825,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 25, 2011",ACEA95FQS1AVP,convenient multi-pack,"I usually use Playtex tampons, mainly because they have a large multi-pack and plastic applciators.  So, when I saw that Tampax was offering a similar product, I decided to try it.  I find both products protect equally well (anyway, they are all limited by regulations on how absorbant they can be due to that Rely scare years ago), so it really comes down to price and convenience.  This box has a good assortment with 10 lites, 10 super and the largest portion of regulars - which will probably suit most women.  The price via the Amazon Subscribe and Save is very reasonable (and much cheaper than my grocery store), and definitely convenient being delivered right to your door.  I don\'t have to worry about running out, and for some women who are uncomfortable buying them in stores this is a great alternative.Overall, a good reiable product from a reputable brand at a reasonable price.  Recommended."

The size and absorbency seems to be comparable, and I am able to make it through the night with these.  I am sad to be putting the plastic of the applicator into the landfill, but happy that I know I\'m 46 and only have a few years to go.  I do miss the convenience of being able to put the ob\'s in my pocket.  Hopefully someone will see the need of a tampon like the ob ultra."
140,140,20110308,B00284B59G,5,"March 8, 2011",A1AV2XXZB8CUPP,Great alternative to OB Ultra...,"Since OB has unfortunately stopped making their Ultra tampons, I was left with no choice but to find an alternative product (after YEARS of using OB).  After reading another review that referenced OB, I decided to give this brand a try.  As the other reviewer said, these are just as good as OB, and are a great alternative.  The shape is entirely different from OB  (sort of in the shape of a sting ray, once expanded), but still very absorbent and the thick braid string is a blessing. :) That is one major con about the OB ones, is that they only had a very small string, so it may not entirely be a bad thing that they stopped manufacturing them!Highly suggested for those seeking a replacement to OB\'s Ultra tampons!"
64,64,20110913,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 13, 2011",A11IKWE7B29TOJ,"Not Bad, But I Wouldn\'t Switch From My Regular Brand","I\'m a Playtex girl through and through. No idea how I got started buying the Playtex brand, but I\'ve stuck to it for about 12 years now. I was open to trying Pearl because a) the Tampax name is a good one, b) I love the idea of Pearl- the word just sounds nice and comfortable, and c) How different can tampons be, anyway?These tampons weren\'t bad, but they also weren\'t quite as comfortable as my regular Playtex (Gentle Glide, in case you\'re wondering). They seemed a little cheaper and the actual tampon definitely wasn\'t as sturdy and ended up actually falling apart a bit.Oh, but I am a fan of the super to easy open packaging. I just don\'t think I\'d replace my Playtex for these.And this is officially the most awkward Amazon review I\'ve written...."
153,153,20110202,B0029NYQQA,5,"February 2, 2011",A2WJTM8UD6HKY3,Fantastic,"I love these tampons so much that I haven\'t used anything else since I first discovered them two years ago! I don\'t know why other reviewers are saying that they take some \'getting used to\' ... they are EXACTLY like any other tampon except that they\'re stored \'in half\', so to speak - the tampon half inside of the applicator half - for greater discretion. Once you click them open (which takes about one second - if you can click a ballpoint pen, you can do this) they are exactly like every other tampon, and you just insert them as normal.Another great thing about these tampons is the packaging. The external package (the part that says \'Tampax Compak Pearl\') contains four boxes of 10 tampons each: one purple box of 10 lites, two yellow boxes of 10 regulars, and one green box of 10 supers. The color-coded boxes are very discreet; they are just pretty patterns with no words printed on them at all. Very nice for when you want to store some tampons in your desk at work, in your locker at school, or in your boyfriend\'s bathroom. ;)"
16,16,20111027,B001G7QRG2,5,"October 27, 2011",A132I7J24U5DKW,The lighter side of...  well you know...,"Don\'t you just love that tampon companies seem to think we only need a few light tampons?  Well, that is what it seems to me.  They put perhaps 4 or 8 of these in the multi-packs and make the stand alone lights hard to find and in small quantities.  I find I use lots of Ultras the first part of the period, a bit of the super and regular absorbancy for a short time in the middle and then lots of lights at the very end.  So a multi-pack with mostly Regulars does not help me much.I have used these and the Pearl version and find they both work very similarly, except these are a bit more ego-friend;y with cardboard applicators.  I have to be honest, these are the only size I buy with cardboard, any other absorbancy is a bit uncomfortable for me.  I go through the most of these anyways and it takes a bit of the cost down.Why not get these in bulk?  I always say, if you will need it anyways and it doesn\'t expire, get a bunch at a great price and be prepared!"
150,150,20111002,B0029NYQQA,2,"October 2, 2011",A1ZG9I0TYI0K27,Unsatisfactory,Seemed like a great deal but these tampons are really difficult to put out of the container. This is my main problem with this product. i\'ve had better luck with even generic tampon brands.
120,120,20120402,B00284B59G,1,"April 2, 2012",ATKTQFZSQLVSQ,New leak guard is awful,I have used this brand for many years. They rarely leaked and you could flush it all. Until now. The leak guard is SO irritating!!! I have thrown out two boxes and bought playtex. Someone didn\'t do their research. I can\'t seem to find new tampax without the leak guard \'skirt\' and so I won\'t be buying these until Tampax realizes that women do not need skirts on their tampons.
156,156,20100121,B0029NYQRY,5,"January 21, 2010",A3NEL69RYUFI75,Finally just the ones I need,"These were awesome.  Shipped quickly, even over the holidays.  This has got to be my favorite christmas present.  They were just so much fun to use!  Which reminds me, I was disappointed I was only able to find these new.  I can usually get a discount by buying used on amazon, but I don\'t find any of these plastic lite pearls for sale used anywhere?!Ok, so I bought these for my wife and I\'m being a bit tongue in cheek.  She was really happy."
53,53,20110921,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 21, 2011",A1DTCJV6KOMJOA,This Calls for an International Coffee,"I\'ve been using Tampax for many years and have been using the multipack for a while. It is all about convenience, it allows me to grab the right size for the right day. I don\'t have a problem with *cough* insertion (please, take a big sip of coffee). I just love that it gives my wallet a rest and I don\'t have to buy separate packs. And also, we all get stressed out, hormones change, and we tend to not even realize that what started out as a heavy period has lightened up quite a bit before its over and we don\'t need to use one for heavy absorbency."
107,107,20110320,B001LK6XI6,4,"March 20, 2011",A2RKSLYB423SSJ,Happy with the convenience and price of ordering on Amazon,"I bought these tampons through amazon because of the featured price and coupon.  The compact versions are always more convenient, but the function is the same. Packaging was easy and the product included coupons.  Thanks Amazon for making my life easier!"
103,103,20110803,B001LK6XI6,4,"August 3, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Good tampons but wouldn\'t buy on a regular basis,"In general, these are good tampons, easy to insert and comfortable. I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."

I hate though that they have no applicators.  The Tampax Pearl Ultra is just as good as the OB Ultra and there is the very useful, non messy applicator. Makes a yucky situation a bit more bearable."
33,33,20120425,B001H9PUR6,5,"April 25, 2012",A3Q3ZOIIXVKWQF,great product and fast shipping,"3 days from order to UPS receipt at my door.  I have always had a problem buying feminine hygiene products from  the drug store or supermarket, especially in such a quantity. I just find it embarrassing, though it only makes sense to  buy in quantity something you know you will use and save money.Amazon and associated merchants have always been great.  Most of the time I have just bought books. But recently have been buying clothes as well as other products. And even with shipping costs find I can get things cheaper than at local stores.Only bad thing is these have plastic insertion. Not that good for the environment but sure makes insertion much easier."

49,49,20110928,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 28, 2011",A3CNM18PWKI1Z9,Nothing Beats Tampax Pearl,"In the world of tampons, no brand can beat Tampax. No matter how hard they try, Tampax\'s competitors never manage to reproduce the 100% hassle-free experience of Tampax. They always mess up one thing or another while Tampax manages to offer solutions to every single aspect of your menstruation.At the same time, in the world of Tampax tampons, Tampax Pearl, in my opinion, is the very best. It\'s the most comfortable, easy to use variety of Tampax. I think it\'s a brilliant idea to sell this kind of variety packs because you can just buy a 50-count box and use it for several menstrual cycles in a variety of situations.Tampax has surely done a lot over the years to make women\'s lives easier, and I salute them for it."
25,25,20111103,B001G7QV1I,4,"November 3, 2011",A25GKR5BCDEON7,Good but bad.,I have recently decided to find the staple tampon brand that I will use for the rest of my period-having life and these may be it... I am also reducing my pad usage to nights when I will be asleep for a long time.  One of the main reasons is the flushable applicator.  I\'m no longer going to waste extra tissues wrapping the applicator up to hide in the trash.  And think about all the waste I am reducing.The only con about this would have to be the fact that they have blunt tips.  The cotton is exposed at the tip and it is not tapered.  It can be uncomfortable when inserting.
115,115,20110710,B00284B56Y,1,"July 10, 2011",ACXCMZQ6H1DUA,Don\'t buy these!,Buy the competitor brand in the black box.  These are so useless; they only get longer instead of expanding all around.  Major leaks!

That being said, my wife only uses these.  I can really only review the packaging here, which is probably what you want to know about.  It\'s a multi-pack, containing 10 light and 10 super, and 30 of the regular size tampons.  It\'s a great assortment and last several cycles.  The price, as is usual around here, is excellent.  Save yourself some time and money if this is your brand and get them here."

155,155,20101106,B0029NYQQA,4,"November 6, 2010",A3N07JANJ8PWI9,Takes getting used to,"Well, they take some getting used to. What I have learned and was hoping to find info on before purchasing: They come with the applicator stick already in the tube and per instructions you have to pull it out till it clicks and then when inserting push it back in until it clicks. Great idea for making them take up less room and not get ruined in your pocket or purse. They are a little more flimsy then the regular ones so you have to be careful. Also, the first one the stick fell into the toilet. I have been careful with the rest, strategically holding them, but the rest have not really seemed as loose so it might have just been a fluke thing. They take a little getting used to and I haven\'t seen them in super plus yet, but I will continue to use them when I don\'t need the plus."
73,73,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A25RTRAPQAJBDJ,Great product.,My girlfriend says \'I love the variety pack of tampons!

The convenience of the variety pack is great!\'
75,75,20110904,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 4, 2011",A3TP31S61PPE3G,Regular and Super work great -- the light is an \'eh\' for me,I like the packaging on the tampons - they are easy to open and to dispose of. The plastic applicator makes it easy to insert as well. The regular and super work very well - with little to no leakage except on the heaviest of days. The light you should only use for VERY light days as it has a tendency to leak onto the string more even with a very light flow. These had no particular scent or odor control.Overall another excellent Tampax product. Just use the regular for the lighter flow until it gets very light.
93,93,20110617,B001LK6XHW,5,"June 17, 2011",AOY1BUICNSYYK,The one.,"The string on these makes all the difference.I must say that after trying just about every type of brand of tampon out there, Tampax Pearl is the only one i can rely on to not leak. There are instances when it does, but that is only when it can\'t hold anymore in, which is rare -- and if this happens Ultra is the way to go.Another plus is the applicator, which is plastic and so much easier to use than the paper cardboard ones other brand have.I must say i have found the one that works for me and the price on here is hard to beat."

I like that it is sent straight to my door and my kids don\'t even see them!  Buying this way was also a cheaper price than our local Wal-Mart store.

What I\'m reviewing is the true luxury and convenience of shopping at Amazon.com!  I\'m super busy working full-time and being pulled in many different directions - as I\'m sure many are - so ordering this type of product online has been wonderful.  It sure beats sending the hubby to the store and getting the mystery box when he returns!

I have used Tampax for years and have never had any pain or health problems from their usage, and I will continue to use them till I no longer have a need for them.

There were some pro\'s and some con\'s.Pro\'s:the box is super colorfulthe wrapper holding the tampon was easy to use and cutethe applicator was cute- light blueI absoulty LOVE the fresh scent!!!!Con\'s:The tampon got wider, which was uncomfortable to take outand it felt like it was gonna fall out through out my whole period"

They go in very easily, and I\'ve never had the problems with them falling out that some other reviewers have mentioned. For someone who has a heavy flow (as I do), this multipack won\'t cover all of your needs, but this one box should last a long time. I usually buy this multipack plus another box of Supers and a box of Super Plus, and I\'m set for several months. I\'ve tried Playtex Gentle Glide and Kotex U, but I keep coming back to Tampax Pearl--I simply haven\'t found a better tampon!"

Like all other Tampax Pearl the string is what makes this product amazing, since it prevents leaking. The applicator is also amazing, easy to hold and MUCH easier to use than the paper cardboard ones.I myself prefer the unscented version, since the scented smells a bit too strong and chemically."

I wish it were made of organic, unbleached cotton and that the applicator were made of biodegradable plastic.  The unnecessarily harsh environmental impact of the product is why I rated it four stars instead of five and is also the reason I do not use these all the time.  However, if I am in a situation in which I would not otherwise be able to leave my house, this is the product on which I rely."

54,54,20110920,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 20, 2011",A3CHMHGSJSQ02J,Good multipack,"Like many reviewers have said, this multipack has just the right mix of sizes/absorbencies for the average woman. One of the things I normally don\'t like about plastic-applicator tampons is the heavy fragrance/scent. It just seems unhealthy to me, and it\'s one of the reasons I prefer cardboard applicators. The Unscented tampons here are a great idea. The plastic applicator is also easier to use than others I\'ve tried, which are always much too thin in the \'grip\' area, causing (TMI ALERT) painful stabbing and pinching.I\'ll probably gravitate back to my usual cardboard Tampax, but this product is definitely a good value for those who prefer plastic."

When I first got my period I was in complete panic. At first I didn\'t use tampons and I only used pads.. boy was that a nightmare! I somehow always got stains on my butt in school and every single person knew that I had my period lol. Super embarrassing... anyhow, thank god for tampons because I never had that problem ever again! I searched for the best tampon for about a week and finally got to these and never thought twice again, these are amazing. They are comfortable, easy to slide in, they absorb an amazing amount and I almost never even get a drip on my emergency pad/pantyliner. If you do not have heavy flow though I do not recommend these and they are pretty big compared to super and below. If you do have heavy for first days then they are perfect for that too and then just switch to a lighter absorbency when it gets towards the end of your period. These are awesome and the price is a good deal too. :)"

As women we have all probably figured out what our favorite brands are and what features we find best to suit our particular needs. I use light absorbency tampons which for some reason are rather difficult to find in retail stores, and when I do find them they are typically 2 times the price of others and there isn\'t ever a generic cheaper version. I purchased this 3 pack of 20 count tampons because there was a coupon offered at the time and with subscribe and save they ended up only being around 3 dollars a box. I have always liked the comfortable plastic applicator of the tampax \'pearl\' series, the compact style (1/2 the size of a regular applicator tampon) is such a wonderful feature, especially if carrying in your purse and they\'re small enough that you could inconspicuously tote one around in your pants pocket if need be. Just in case any of you aren\'t familiar with how the compact feature works...you remove the 1/2 sized tampon from the wrapper, hold the bottom textured part of the applicator, then simply pull out the base piece which will lock into place once completely pulled out (it aligns itself behind the cotton tampon inside) then viola you have a full sized tampon to use! Very convenient! I guess that\'s everything :) Reminder to you ladies out there...always remember to use the appropriate absorbency for your flow or you risk serious injury, even death form toxic shock. I believe they should sell light absorbency tampons more places instead of forcing women to use regular absorbency due to lack of availability...it\'s very dangerous and very serious...I had a friend that nearly died of TSS and it is a horrible thing to go through."

I definitely prefer to buy cardboard over plastic. Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion."

Also, they expand properly in the width and absorb well, so I have not had any worries about leaking.  In addition, its a nice bonus that this pack comes with three different sizes to use as your flow changes. These are unscented- perfect for those of us who don\'t like those flowery perfumed scents.

Umm... let\'s see.... well, because the applicator is made of plastic, they\'re not the cardboard biodegradable sort of tampon applicator.  However, see my list of pros why this can be a good thing.Pros:1.  The applicator is made of smooth plastic, but with \'Anti-Slip Grip\' - ridges on the part of the applicator where you hold it when putting it in, so you have a better grip.  The last time I used tampons with cardboard applicators, they got slippery as heck when inserting them, so much that they were rendered unusable.  So, these Tampax Pearl tampons are far better in that regard.2.  These are unscented - fragrances in a tampon can cause irritation, so I\'ve always used unscented.3.  Easy to insert, and I don\'t feel them at all once they\'re in.  I will forget that I have a tampon in.4.  They\'ve never leaked, and I\'ll wear each tampon for a full 8-9 hours.

It feels so wasteful to use plastic so briefly and then toss it in the trash.  The plastic is made from oil, which keeps us dependent on other countries and pollutes the air, and then it lingers on in landfills or floats out to sea.  It was recently reported that whale carcasses washing up on California\'s beaches had plastic tampon applicators in their stomachs, among other debris.No, I think Tampax would do better to improve upon their cardboard applicators which at least can be sourced from recycled paperboard or from sustainably managed forests.

The plastic applicator is more comfortable to use than the cardboard, however it is obviously not as biodegradable.  The unscented variety is good for those with sensitivity to perfumes."

62,62,20110914,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 14, 2011",AC11GZAL5N99C,Pearls,"Overall, the brand is wonderful. The one major thing I don\'t like is the plastic applicators as they are not green friendly. Multipacks like this one may not suit your flow, but there\'s enough of each to possibly get you through two months or so without having to pick up additional boxes."
47,47,20110929,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 29, 2011",A4SD8F79JBYG2,The best,"I\'m in my early 40s and have been using tampons since I was 13, so I\'ve had lots of experience with different brands. I think I\'ve tried them all. These are, without doubt, THE VERY BEST. This package of assorted sizes is handy."
15,15,20110604,B001G7QKAA,1,"June 4, 2011",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,Not so good at all,"It is hard to write a review for tampons without sounding gross, but I will try..I do not like these tampons at all. They seem to try to slip out constantly after an hour or two and I have NEVER experienced that with any tampon in my life. I am 34 years old, so I have been using tampons - many different brands and varieties for 20 years now. This has got to be the worst I have ever used.They always seem to allow leakage as well. This is not from leaving them in too long, or due to extra heavy flow. They just leak, period (no pun intended!!).I ordered these in Super Absorbency from Amazon since they had such a dirt cheap price for the 2 boxes. I did use up both boxes just so I didn\'t feel like I wasted my money, but I will never buy them again. I had the same terrible results with both boxes.I cannot imagine using them if you have extra heavy or heavy flow."
152,152,20110407,B0029NYQQA,5,"April 7, 2011",A141QC5GR9CDLL,Travel size,"Same great Tampax, only compressed to about the length of a Twinkie.  Really easy to tote around in smaller handbags."
158,158,20120329,B003CP13OM,5,"March 29, 2012",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,"No frills, just tampons","This is hands down an all around classic product that works superbly. Sure there are all the flashy new tampon types out there nowadays, with all their new \'technology\' and \'improvements\'  (and really, how much technology can go into a tampon?? It\'s cotton on a string afterall!) and all the flashy advertising, but I am always let down with a leak of some sort. This has been the only tampon that I can count on over the years. There are never any leaks, no wet strings - nothing to worry about at all.They do what they are supposed to do without any issues at all and they are cheap. You can fully dispose of the entire product, wrapper, applicator and all, by flushing it down the toilet. Cheap, efficient, reliable - what more could you want?"
131,131,20110903,B00284B59G,5,"September 3, 2011",A3MXTBZ38QCDJK,Yahoo!,"I was so glad to see these!! Finally something to make you feel more comfortable! Super plus are good but often you want more protection just in case if you are at work or in public and can\'t run to the bathroom every hour! Are these new? I haven\'t seen them before, I tried them for the very first time about 2 weeks ago. So glad Tampax developed these! Thank you! Highly recommended."
154,154,20101222,B0029NYQQA,4,"December 22, 2010",A3PKIEHWSWN4JF,These are good...,"They do take some getting used to. You must click it to get it right. Although, dont expect to hear a click more like feel it with your fingers. You dont have to push it in until you hear the click either. If its in all the way just pull out the barrel like you would do a normal Tampon. These are really small & cute. The boxes are discreet. The first few times you might leak a little bit but once you get the hang of using these, it will be alright. As every woman knows, you can always wear a little pad to help with the leaks. =)"

An item that is secure and dependable. I have been using Tampax Pearls for years and I love the Triple Pack that gives you all three - light, regular and super absorbent. I stick by products that I believe in and I think you will agree that Tampax is the one that wins!"
106,106,20110508,B001LK6XI6,5,"May 8, 2011",AY08S9OMRZV8V,Won\'t spend money on any other tampon.,I have tried different brands of tampons with different aplicators. I this is my most preferred tampon. It is very easy to use.. I love that it glides well and that the opening of the applicator has a more rounded design so that it doesn\'t cause discomfort when being used.

That got me thinking and comparing prices. This packaging of 2 boxes of 100 count each, was the best deal per each. Plus free shipping from Amazon. This was a lot cheaper than buying it from a pharmacy or a grocery store. And! This is important! The shipment came in a plain brown box, no markings on it. Although I found it funny that after my purchase Amazon offered me to post my purchase on Facebook: I just purchased 200 Tampons. :) No thanks."

The applicator change was good...the tampon change was not.  I have never had so many problems as I do with this new version.  And, the price paid here was $6 higher than at Costco.  These I will donate to a women\'s shelter. My quest for either older versions of the product or a different brand that works continues."
101,101,20110908,B001LK6XI6,5,"September 8, 2011",A3Q11JB1BTGPW1,Awesome Deal,This package is a great deal! Its an even better deal if you use subscribe and save. I\'ve been using Amazon for alot of the bulk products instead of going to my local BJS/Cosco- Amazon is more conveinent and usually a better deal. The only downside of buying bulk on Amazon instead of Cosco is that you will miss out on samples of random pizza bites and mac and cheese. Darn.
88,88,20110622,B001LK6XHC,5,"June 22, 2011",A3DD2R0RYMAJWZ,I have used every single one,"They are absolutely a necessity for every woman! Not only that, but they are comfortable, affordable and come in a variety of absorbency strengths to be of use for all types of menstrual flow.Without these tampons I might have had to use a small towel or furry animal to soak up all the blood!Thanks Kotex!p.s. I have only one recommendation: I think that you should over a promotion or a coupon savings for customers who save all their used tampon applicators and send them in. Carbonated beverage companies do that for their cans, as well as some candy bar companies in respect to their wrappers. It is just a suggestion but I think it would be very beneficial for everyone."
92,92,20110803,B001LK6XHW,4,"August 3, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Good tampons but wouldn\'t buy on a regular basis,"In general, these are good tampons, easy to insert and comfortable. I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."
71,71,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A2RX62V4E2BF5Z,I\'ll always be a Tampax Girl,"Tampax has always been my first choice tampon. I normally go with the normal Tampax, not the Pearl line. There are a few \'upgrades\' with the Pearl line, in addition to the quality and protection you know and trust from Tampax.Instead of the traditional paper wrap, these are in an easy to open plastic wrap. Tampax calls these purse-friendly, and indeed they are. We\'ve all found that torn open, slightly disassembled tampon at the bottom of our purse. You won\'t have that problem with the Pearl line. The multi-pack, for me, always runs out of mediums and leaves me with only the barely useful light and the super absorbency is just scary big.The blunt cardboard applicator has been replaced with a \'smooth plastic applicator and rounded tip for comfortable insertion\'. I won\'t say you can\'t tell the difference, but chances are you won\'t care. The difference is so insignificant that I don\'t find it worth the additional cost, both financially and to the environment. That is pretty much the story of the Pearl line. Like with the absorbent braid, I don\'t koow that the ever so slight amount of additional protection will ever, in your life, make even the slightest difference.The Pearl line, like the normal Tampax line, is great. For me, I\'ll stick with the less expensive, paper wrapped, cardboard applicators. BUT, if the added feature seem like they would make a difference to you, then go for Pearl."
10,10,20110826,B001G7QJQA,5,"August 26, 2011",A3AKI38YHMGOHX,The ONLY tampon I trust,I have very heavy flow days and so many other tampons have disappointed me. I buy very expensive panties and do not enjoy having to replace them because my tampon didnt hold up. These always work even on my heaviest days and they feel a lot more comfortable than other tampons.
