I hate though that they have no applicators.  The Tampax Pearl Ultra is just as good as the OB Ultra and there is the very useful, non messy applicator. Makes a yucky situation a bit more bearable."
20,20,20110324,B001G7QV18,5,"March 24, 2011",AZA595ZPIG240,Many To Last,I bought this for my girlfriend. Instead of going to local market. I am buying this in bulk online to SAVE TIME AND MONEY.
65,65,20110911,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 11, 2011",AX7QMRXX81L9K,"Good product, flawed idea","When Tampax came out with these variety boxes, I wondered how it would work, if the numbers of each type of tampons would work out.  For me, the numbers don\'t work.  You can\'t predict how many of each type you\'ll need each month and I find myself using one that\'s not quite right just because it\'s all I have or because I have too many of one kind and am trying to finish them up.  That being said, I\'ve used Tampax for years and the product is great.  I\'ll stick with buying separate boxes with different absorbancies as needed."
8,8,20111128,B001G7QJQA,5,"November 28, 2011",ABZ8HUFDTASFZ,The Best Tampons. Period!,These are the best tampons I have ever used.  They are a bit more expensive but worth it. I recommend them all of the time.
75,75,20110904,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 4, 2011",A3TP31S61PPE3G,Regular and Super work great -- the light is an \'eh\' for me,I like the packaging on the tampons - they are easy to open and to dispose of. The plastic applicator makes it easy to insert as well. The regular and super work very well - with little to no leakage except on the heaviest of days. The light you should only use for VERY light days as it has a tendency to leak onto the string more even with a very light flow. These had no particular scent or odor control.Overall another excellent Tampax product. Just use the regular for the lighter flow until it gets very light.
1,1,20041127,B0000VCZ70,5,"November 27, 2004",A2PA01OKPQ704D,Tampax is great,"It looks to me like the reviewer from England didn\'t actually purchase the tampons, it\'s just someone who has a grudge against tampons in general and Tampax in particular.  I have used Tampax for years and have never had any pain or health problems from their usage, and I will continue to use them till I no longer have a need for them.  Not only that, but the price for a box of 100 is excellent."
15,15,20110604,B001G7QKAA,1,"June 4, 2011",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,Not so good at all,"It is hard to write a review for tampons without sounding gross, but I will try..I do not like these tampons at all. They seem to try to slip out constantly after an hour or two and I have NEVER experienced that with any tampon in my life. I am 34 years old, so I have been using tampons - many different brands and varieties for 20 years now. This has got to be the worst I have ever used.They always seem to allow leakage as well. This is not from leaving them in too long, or due to extra heavy flow. They just leak, period (no pun intended!!).I ordered these in Super Absorbency from Amazon since they had such a dirt cheap price for the 2 boxes. I did use up both boxes just so I didn\'t feel like I wasted my money, but I will never buy them again. I had the same terrible results with both boxes.I cannot imagine using them if you have extra heavy or heavy flow."
77,77,20110902,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 2, 2011",A3EI4K5U61UZ7,Great variety pack,"Great variety pack for those periods when flow varies.  The plastic applicator is more comfortable to use than the cardboard, however it is obviously not as biodegradable.  The unscented variety is good for those with sensitivity to perfumes."
59,59,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",AIIR8E34EDKCQ,One of the better brands out there,"Tampax Pearl is way better than regular Tampax tampons, the applicator no longer feels like a torture device and they work great at night or during day, I also appreciate the different sizes even though I don\'t usually need other than regular, they\'re good to share if you have sisters and friends and there\'s nothing more annoying than running out, so this is great for stocking up.Just remember not to flush the applicator, plastic doesn\'t do well in the septic system :P"
36,36,20091226,B001K3IH06,5,"December 26, 2009",AHS6R8WDR8828,Perfect size for me!,"I have always had problems with regular tampons being too wide and lites too narrow. This \'slender\' tampon seems to be a good in-between size. It is still quite absorbent, though."
73,73,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A25RTRAPQAJBDJ,Great product.,My girlfriend says \'I love the variety pack of tampons! They come with enough of each absorption amount so that I always have what I need.  I have always loved the Tampax Pearl and would recommend them highly. The convenience of the variety pack is great!\'
124,124,20120126,B00284B59G,5,"January 26, 2012",A2CT6DUIFOI2TZ,Life saver for women after babies!,Tampax has finally made a tampon for women!!! Women tend to have heavier periods after having children. These are a life saver. It is the ONLY tampon that has complete protection and able to take the extra flow. This is the next step if S or SP do not work for you. They are wider than SP and probably hold 75% more. I am very happy with the the Ultra tampons. Everyone I have recommended them to have been very happy.
113,113,20110821,B00284B56Y,5,"August 21, 2011",A22I55P15NSAOX,These are the ones for your daughter to try as first tampons.,These are the ones for your young daughter to try to use when she first starts learning to use a tampon.  The plastic makes them easier to insert (also buy her some lubricant and have her stand up with her foot up on the toilet or even higher ).  The \'lip\' at the edge of the tampon makes it easier to grip as well. The LITES are smaller and easier for a young girl to use. The small size and individual wrapping makes them easy to put in a pocket.Use your own judgement to make sure that she is mature enough to remember to remove them at regular intervals.  But if she participates in sports/swimming/dance having this option is invaluable so that she can participate in her normal activities.
40,40,20120228,B001LK6XHC,4,"February 28, 2012",A1R1BFJCMWX0Y3,I could do without the light ones,"While this is not my preferred brand, it was still nice since it was free and a good sized muli pack. I never use light so those just ended up in the trash. I fond of Kotex but would purchase this brand, but not this pack with the Super/Reg/Light"
11,11,20110313,B001G7QJQA,4,"March 13, 2011",A1NOEAO9V65ZAH,Good product.,"Welp- it\'s a tampon. What can I say. It works great, but occasionally I feel like stuff gets by on the lighter days- how that works I wouldn\'t even know. It does the job on heavy days. Case closed."
102,102,20110811,B001LK6XI6,5,"August 11, 2011",A1FOX093BGKU3U,Best ever,This is the best tampon i have ever used. Very comfortable and easy to use. Glad it is available online and thanks for the fast delivery
156,156,20100121,B0029NYQRY,5,"January 21, 2010",A3NEL69RYUFI75,Finally just the ones I need,"These were awesome.  Shipped quickly, even over the holidays.  This has got to be my favorite christmas present.  They were just so much fun to use!  Which reminds me, I was disappointed I was only able to find these new.  I can usually get a discount by buying used on amazon, but I don\'t find any of these plastic lite pearls for sale used anywhere?!Ok, so I bought these for my wife and I\'m being a bit tongue in cheek.  She was really happy."
41,41,20120216,B001LK6XHC,4,"February 16, 2012",AGBFIQMV9L61Y,I\'ll stick with cardboard applicators.,"Tampax tampons are my go-to brand. I usually buy the 50-count box with cardboard applicators but thought I\'d finally give these Pearls a try.They are just as effective as what I am used to using. The only difference is the plastic applicator, which, honestly, does move things along more smoothly. However, for the money, there isn\'t enough of a difference between these two types to make me spring for the higher-priced version of tampon.I will say, though, that if you are just starting to use tampons, a plastic applicator might be more comfortable--and that would probably make paying a little extra money for the Pearls worthwhile."
43,43,20111025,B001LK6XHC,5,"October 25, 2011",A209G57KXCBF4C,Great,Ok...how do I rate this?  My wife says they are fantastic.  Easy to use and effective.  What else can I say?
89,89,20110617,B001LK6XHC,5,"June 17, 2011",AOY1BUICNSYYK,Great Variety,"I prefer the Tampax Pearl to many other brands, due to its comfortable applicator and reliable protection. I mostly got this box because of the price, which is a lot cheaper than buying in store. However, the variety (light, regular, super) allowed me to try different types and find the ones that work best for me. Every woman is different and might have a different experience with these."
82,82,20110829,B001LK6XHC,4,"August 29, 2011",A34C98SJU4M7DD,Great Multipack! They DO What They Are Ment To Do!,"The Tampax Pearl tampons do what they are intended to do.I have tried many brands of tampons over the years, they are NOT all created equal and Tampax  are a great brand and it has been a regular brand that I use! Do not have to worry about accidents! They come in a handy variety box.The plasic applicator makes them more comfortable to use and the only type I will use!"
130,130,20110915,B00284B59G,5,"September 15, 2011",A1AGXOGJ0H9XED,Awesome!!,"Never fear, all of you former Ob Ultra users, this tampon works!!  As someone who ran out of the ob Ultra a few months ago and have been having a terrible time of it since, this is a Godsend.  I think this might even be better.  I might have to try their other sizes as well--since ob didn\'t have any loyalty to me, I no longer have any loyalty to them."
66,66,20110908,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 8, 2011",A1WSQ0QRWQC7VI,i will say this,it\'s a tampon...it works but not s good as our usual brand. i like that it camewith a variety or absorbancy types in the same box but my daughter found them uncomfortable. personally i ouldn\'t buy this brand because it wasn\'t made or shaped the same way as our usual brand. i liked the quiet wrapper though.
150,150,20111002,B0029NYQQA,2,"October 2, 2011",A1ZG9I0TYI0K27,Unsatisfactory,Seemed like a great deal but these tampons are really difficult to put out of the container. This is my main problem with this product. i\'ve had better luck with even generic tampon brands.
28,28,20100213,B001G7QV1I,5,"February 13, 2010",A3J4HLF05HDZM8,Box of \'pons,"You get what you pay for, a giant box of tampons.Sometimes I wish they had \'extra super\' size for that first day included.I have to buy a separate pack and to tell you the truth, I sometimes buy up and buy the pearls."
153,153,20110202,B0029NYQQA,5,"February 2, 2011",A2WJTM8UD6HKY3,Fantastic,"I love these tampons so much that I haven\'t used anything else since I first discovered them two years ago! I don\'t know why other reviewers are saying that they take some \'getting used to\' ... they are EXACTLY like any other tampon except that they\'re stored \'in half\', so to speak - the tampon half inside of the applicator half - for greater discretion. Once you click them open (which takes about one second - if you can click a ballpoint pen, you can do this) they are exactly like every other tampon, and you just insert them as normal.Another great thing about these tampons is the packaging. The external package (the part that says \'Tampax Compak Pearl\') contains four boxes of 10 tampons each: one purple box of 10 lites, two yellow boxes of 10 regulars, and one green box of 10 supers. The color-coded boxes are very discreet; they are just pretty patterns with no words printed on them at all. Very nice for when you want to store some tampons in your desk at work, in your locker at school, or in your boyfriend\'s bathroom. ;)"
138,138,20110417,B00284B59G,4,"April 17, 2011",A1660P709XWYDI,Pretty good!,"For those of us who are mourning the loss of the O.B. Ultra tampons, this is a pretty close substitute. The only reason I didn\'t give it all five stars is that we\'re still stuck with the applicator. I\'m just thankful I\'ve found this product!"
161,161,20110816,B003CP13OM,3,"August 16, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Tampax changed the design- not very comfortable anymore,"These provide good protection, don\'t leak, and the applicator and wrapper are flushable and biodegradable. I definitely prefer to buy cardboard over plastic. Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion."
122,122,20120315,B00284B59G,5,"March 15, 2012",A1NWZYC0G025HC,a gift from heaven,"When OB discontinued the ultra tampons, I was nervous I wouldn\'t be able to find a replacement.  These are them! In fact, they work better than the ultras. The only thing that I miss is the small size of the ultras but these still are so much better."
22,22,20120216,B001G7QV1I,5,"February 16, 2012",A1UC50DYFPSXYD,These are the BEST!,"It\'s a weird to review a feminine hygeine product. Anyhow, I\'ve used these for twenty years. Love them. They are the most reliable tampons out there. I actually really like these better than the \'Tampax Pearl\' ones, as I can\'t stand the closed top and plastic applicator on the \'Pearl\'. These are my tried and true brand. I will never buy another. I also love the mix pack for the various stages of my cycle.I also am a subscribe & save fanatic! I save money, but I really just appreciate saving so much time by not having to go to the store. We always stock up on stuff and used to do so at a club store. Now we just use subscribe & save. On items like these, where you know you\'ll be buying them periodically for a long time, subscribe & save is awesome!"
164,164,20120430,B003CTRDEW,5,"April 30, 2012",A2AJOQ0FEOA5JN,You\'ll get cheapest price if you\'ll buy in bulk.,"Remember, Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory show telling Penny to buy feminine products in bulk, because they do not go bad, and for sure she would be using them for next 20 years? That got me thinking and comparing prices. This packaging of 2 boxes of 100 count each, was the best deal per each. Plus free shipping from Amazon. This was a lot cheaper than buying it from a pharmacy or a grocery store. And! This is important! The shipment came in a plain brown box, no markings on it. Although I found it funny that after my purchase Amazon offered me to post my purchase on Facebook: I just purchased 200 Tampons. :) No thanks."
67,67,20110908,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 8, 2011",A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,Excellent and Superior To Regular Tampax!,"The Tampax Pearl tampons are the very best in my opinion of all the tampons with an applicator. Ok, well this is going to be a bit personal.  But what I like about these are they do easily glide in, they are not as long and weirdly shaped as regular Tampax and some other brands and they just \'fit\' better. Also, they expand properly in the width and absorb well, so I have not had any worries about leaking.  In addition, its a nice bonus that this pack comes with three different sizes to use as your flow changes. These are unscented- perfect for those of us who don\'t like those flowery perfumed scents. These are a tad pricey, but worth the cost in my opinion and I will deifnitely continue to use these."
26,26,20110820,B001G7QV1I,4,"August 20, 2011",A1FQGF3LUM0HU3,What is there to say beyond great price?,"They\'re Tampax tampons. I\'m not going to get into the particulars, but they\'re the brand I\'ve always used, and likely always will use. The subscribe & save price is great and the shipping was amazingly fast."
101,101,20110908,B001LK6XI6,5,"September 8, 2011",A3Q11JB1BTGPW1,Awesome Deal,This package is a great deal! Its an even better deal if you use subscribe and save. I\'ve been using Amazon for alot of the bulk products instead of going to my local BJS/Cosco- Amazon is more conveinent and usually a better deal. The only downside of buying bulk on Amazon instead of Cosco is that you will miss out on samples of random pizza bites and mac and cheese. Darn.
107,107,20110320,B001LK6XI6,4,"March 20, 2011",A2RKSLYB423SSJ,Happy with the convenience and price of ordering on Amazon,"I bought these tampons through amazon because of the featured price and coupon.  The compact versions are always more convenient, but the function is the same. Packaging was easy and the product included coupons.  Thanks Amazon for making my life easier!"
144,144,20100419,B0028916CC,5,"April 19, 2010",A2NKP3E5F90VFT,Almost Too Good,"As the box states, these are ULTRA absorbent. With the exception of the first 24 hours of my cycle, with these, I don\'t need to change as often. I feel \'ultra\' secure with these. For example, if I use one right before leaving the house, I feel confident that I can make it to my destination without having to RUSH to the nearest restroom or worry about \'accidents.\' Beware though, and don\'t get too overconfident in these. Especially during the early days, you still need to closely monitor yourself. BUT, these provide a lot more reassurance, and because you use fewer in the moderate to lighter days, you save money. They\'re really the only level of protection needed."
37,37,20090407,B001K3IH06,5,"April 7, 2009",A1JTQCIL88W9JV,Hard to find item delivered to your door,"At the grocery or drugstore it is hard to find a box of \'slender\' only. Usually they are mixed in an assortment. For those with young daughters who want to avoid the whole pad thing, this is a great starter size. It is actually a regular, that has been slimmed down to an easier size for rookies. So pleased that Amazon stocks this item."
79,79,20110901,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 1, 2011",A36AIK1DQPSRNT,***A FAV PERSONAL PRODUCT****,"These are my favorites.  The assorted absorbency is a great idea, the plastic applicator allows for ease of use, and the large amount, at least in my case, means that they will last a while.  Not much more to say about a product like this and have it remain a rated G review!DYB"

It saves  my wife the hassle of running out and the price was attractive.  From what I understand, they are as comfortable as could be expected considering. I have not noticed any spotting on the sheets or in the laundry so I would say this product is getting the job done! Stoked."

It is all about convenience, it allows me to grab the right size for the right day. I don\'t have a problem with *cough* insertion (please, take a big sip of coffee). I just love that it gives my wallet a rest and I don\'t have to buy separate packs. And also, we all get stressed out, hormones change, and we tend to not even realize that what started out as a heavy period has lightened up quite a bit before its over and we don\'t need to use one for heavy absorbency."
52,52,20110923,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 23, 2011",A1IW1ANBV0DPVI,Best Tampons Out There,"I LOVE Tampax Pearl\'s - so many other brands try to duplicate this product but they just don\'t get it exactly right - the durable, strong wrappers that can hold up in any crowded bag, the ergonomic applicators w/ no slip grips on the sides, the super absorbant cord - they\'re the best, love these tampons, and I love these assorted packs - it keeps you from having to buy a separate box for heavier or lighter days - what a great way to save some coins."

Excellent protection.,"Although the plastic does generate more non biodegradable waste it makes the use of this product so much simpler, especially for girls just starting to use tampons.  Including various sizes means that you can select the minimum absorbency needed.  Although I tend to gravitate toward the cheaper (and more earth friendly) cardboard versions I do buy these Pearls for my daughter.  There is also a Lite compact version, which she favors for taking with her, as the size of the package is smaller and easier to slip into a pocket or purse.  If you put ease of use over cost then these are the tampons to buy. I highly suggest the Pearl versions for young girls."

How women can deal with using this CARDBOARD today in 2012, knowing that the plastic applicator exists & is sooooo much more COMFORTABLE is beyond me. It did give good protection though(no leaks) But I just can\'t..."

Not sure if the numbers of each in the box will match up with my needs but we\'ll see.  Nice to not have to buy multiple boxes.  Might be nice to have the pearl version but doesn\'t seem worth the extra cost.  Happy with these.

Sure there are all the flashy new tampon types out there nowadays, with all their new \'technology\' and \'improvements\'  (and really, how much technology can go into a tampon?? It\'s cotton on a string afterall!) and all the flashy advertising, but I am always let down with a leak of some sort. This has been the only tampon that I can count on over the years. There are never any leaks, no wet strings - nothing to worry about at all.They do what they are supposed to do without any issues at all and they are cheap. You can fully dispose of the entire product, wrapper, applicator and all, by flushing it down the toilet. Cheap, efficient, reliable - what more could you want?"

But this is a reliable product from brand I\'ve trusted for many years.  As a woman who has tried nearly every brand out there, I can honestly say I do prefer Tampax over its competitors.  I have never bought a multi-box before and this is somewhat convenient, but I will probably buy refills of my needed size next time.  The plastic applicators are much more comfortable and easier to use than cardboard.  The wrappers are sturdy enough to survive in my purse as well."

They go in very easily, and I\'ve never had the problems with them falling out that some other reviewers have mentioned. For someone who has a heavy flow (as I do), this multipack won\'t cover all of your needs, but this one box should last a long time. I usually buy this multipack plus another box of Supers and a box of Super Plus, and I\'m set for several months.

Most often I use the Regular absorbency, and rarely the Super.  I\'m on Yasmin which has significantly lessened my period flow, so I occasionally use the Light absorbency too.Cons:1.  Umm... let\'s see.... well, because the applicator is made of plastic, they\'re not the cardboard biodegradable sort of tampon applicator.  However, see my list of pros why this can be a good thing.Pros:1.  The applicator is made of smooth plastic, but with \'Anti-Slip Grip\' - ridges on the part of the applicator where you hold it when putting it in, so you have a better grip.  The last time I used tampons with cardboard applicators, they got slippery as heck when inserting them, so much that they were rendered unusable.  So, these Tampax Pearl tampons are far better in that regard.2.  These are unscented - fragrances in a tampon can cause irritation, so I\'ve always used unscented.3.  Easy to insert, and I don\'t feel them at all once they\'re in.  I will forget that I have a tampon in.4.  They\'ve never leaked, and I\'ll wear each tampon for a full 8-9 hours.  These tampons work.  Period.  HA!  Get it?  Yep, I\'m a dork.5.  The wrapper is super quiet.I do have to say, another reviewer said these tampons \'worked their way out\'... I don\'t know how this could happen.  Perhaps not inserting them far enough?  I put them in as far as they can go, and they\'ve never worked their way out."

I was so happy when Tampax started packaging their tampons this way because at different times throughout my cycle I use different sizes.  I think most women do this, and normally we\'d have to buy 3 different boxes.  This box makes it so convenient with all three sizes included.  I love the ease of use too.

I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."

I love the smooth plastic applicator but I too had a problem with these staying put.  I guess they are too smooth for me.  I have a heavy flow the first few days so I tried the super size first.  I had to wear a pad with it to contain the leaks.  I recently tried the OB brand super size and they are perfect for my heavy flow days.  They do not fall out and they contain the leaks like no other.  I did use this multipack for my lighter days and got by with just a pantiliner but I can not get past having them fall out when I go to relieve myself.  I do not like having tampons in my septic system and I do not want to have to fish them out.  I have had two children so maybe these would have worked better prior to childbirth.

And I love this variety pack- what a great idea having three different absorbances in one pack. Perfect for me.There is only one con- this isn\'t an organic product, at all. I\'m hoping that in the future Tampax tries to incorporate that more into this product.Tampax Pearl tampons are the most comfortable and easy to use tampons out there.

I don\'t know if they seem really all that better as far as preventing leaks, but they always go in smoothly...never any \'misfires\' with the applicator that makes you have to scrap the tampon, waste it and use another (my pet peeve!!)  And I LOVE the lite size for those days at the very end, or even on a day when I have a lot of discharge.  Regular is just too big for that super light flow day at the very end of my period.  5 stars all the way!  And how awesome is having tampons delivered right to your door?!  :-)"

No reviews yet?- I really like this applicator. Since it\'s a \'pearl\'-like plastic, it slides in easily and comfortably. I also find that it\'s easy to grip the tip while pushing the tampon in. With other brands, I can\'t get a good grip and just end up pushing the whole darn thing in.- Regular is the way to go, I find; I don\'t like the bulk of bigger tampons.- I feel more comfortable with unscented products.

I have only one recommendation: I think that you should over a promotion or a coupon savings for customers who save all their used tampon applicators and send them in. Carbonated beverage companies do that for their cans, as well as some candy bar companies in respect to their wrappers. It is just a suggestion but I think it would be very beneficial for everyone."

It\'s the most comfortable, easy to use variety of Tampax. I think it\'s a brilliant idea to sell this kind of variety packs because you can just buy a 50-count box and use it for several menstrual cycles in a variety of situations.Tampax has surely done a lot over the years to make women\'s lives easier, and I salute them for it."

I am also reducing my pad usage to nights when I will be asleep for a long time.  One of the main reasons is the flushable applicator.  I\'m no longer going to waste extra tissues wrapping the applicator up to hide in the trash.  And think about all the waste I am reducing.The only con about this would have to be the fact that they have blunt tips.  The cotton is exposed at the tip and it is not tapered.

Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion. Kotex is a reasonably priced brand that is more comfortable to remove than these."

So, when I saw that Tampax was offering a similar product, I decided to try it.  I find both products protect equally well (anyway, they are all limited by regulations on how absorbant they can be due to that Rely scare years ago), so it really comes down to price and convenience.  This box has a good assortment with 10 lites, 10 super and the largest portion of regulars - which will probably suit most women.  The price via the Amazon Subscribe and Save is very reasonable (and much cheaper than my grocery store), and definitely convenient being delivered right to your door.  I don\'t have to worry about running out, and for some women who are uncomfortable buying them in stores this is a great alternative.Overall, a good reiable product from a reputable brand at a reasonable price.

Reviewers on drugstore.com have claimed that these actually gave them cramps. Ouch! The cardboard applicators, while being easier to manipulate than the nightmarish Playtex Beyond, can still be difficult. And I\'ve been flushing them with some apprehension even though the box says it\'s okay. Bad, bad, bad. They really effed up a classic brand here. Tampax tampons are inferior to just about every other tampon available now.Pearl is the only Tampax style worth considering...and even then there are cheaper and better tampons, such as Kotex Security, Playtex Gentle Glide, and Playtex Sport.I would only buy these again if absolutely nothing else were available to me."

I somehow always got stains on my butt in school and every single person knew that I had my period lol. Super embarrassing... anyhow, thank god for tampons because I never had that problem ever again! I searched for the best tampon for about a week and finally got to these and never thought twice again, these are amazing. They are comfortable, easy to slide in, they absorb an amazing amount and I almost never even get a drip on my emergency pad/pantyliner. If you do not have heavy flow though I do not recommend these and they are pretty big compared to super and below. If you do have heavy for first days then they are perfect for that too and then just switch to a lighter absorbency when it gets towards the end of your period.

What I have learned and was hoping to find info on before purchasing: They come with the applicator stick already in the tube and per instructions you have to pull it out till it clicks and then when inserting push it back in until it clicks. Great idea for making them take up less room and not get ruined in your pocket or purse. They are a little more flimsy then the regular ones so you have to be careful. Also, the first one the stick fell into the toilet. I have been careful with the rest, strategically holding them, but the rest have not really seemed as loose so it might have just been a fluke thing. They take a little getting used to and I haven\'t seen them in super plus yet, but I will continue to use them when I don\'t need the plus."

71,71,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A2RX62V4E2BF5Z,I\'ll always be a Tampax Girl,"Tampax has always been my first choice tampon. I normally go with the normal Tampax, not the Pearl line. There are a few \'upgrades\' with the Pearl line, in addition to the quality and protection you know and trust from Tampax.Instead of the traditional paper wrap, these are in an easy to open plastic wrap. Tampax calls these purse-friendly, and indeed they are. We\'ve all found that torn open, slightly disassembled tampon at the bottom of our purse. You won\'t have that problem with the Pearl line. The multi-pack, for me, always runs out of mediums and leaves me with only the barely useful light and the super absorbency is just scary big.The blunt cardboard applicator has been replaced with a \'smooth plastic applicator and rounded tip for comfortable insertion\'. I won\'t say you can\'t tell the difference, but chances are you won\'t care. The difference is so insignificant that I don\'t find it worth the additional cost, both financially and to the environment. That is pretty much the story of the Pearl line. Like with the absorbent braid, I don\'t koow that the ever so slight amount of additional protection will ever, in your life, make even the slightest difference.The Pearl line, like the normal Tampax line, is great. For me, I\'ll stick with the less expensive, paper wrapped, cardboard applicators. BUT, if the added feature seem like they would make a difference to you, then go for Pearl."

Feminine hygiene isn\'t exactly a topic that is often discussed, but I just wanted to cast my vote for Tampax Pearl.  They are comfortable, easy to use, and offer great protection.  I won\'t use the generic brand as these are worth the extra cost.  I think they are a great value."

127,127,20111222,B00284B59G,5,"December 22, 2011",A12ZDEYFMEWIZP,Highly Recommend now that OB Ultra is not available.,I would recommend this product to anyone that used to use the OB purple box Ultra.  Since they don\'t make that OB product now this works great!

I wouldn\'t buy another tampon if I was bleeding down my leg......(Christina Agulara.) I love the way they feel......(I have no lover, so these are all I have.) I use them even when I don\'t need them :)"

Super plus are good but often you want more protection just in case if you are at work or in public and can\'t run to the bathroom every hour! Are these new? I haven\'t seen them before, I tried them for the very first time about 2 weeks ago. So glad Tampax developed these! Thank you! Highly recommended."
108,108,20110318,B001LK6XI6,2,"March 18, 2011",A27A83F6FXWX6V,Performs Well but Trashes Environment,"I tried the sample Tampax Pearl tampons included with a box of their regular cardboard applicator tampons.  I had no problem with the performance of the tampon (although it was a bit more difficult to use), but I\'m quite bothered by the production and disposal of this product.  It feels so wasteful to use plastic so briefly and then toss it in the trash.  The plastic is made from oil, which keeps us dependent on other countries and pollutes the air, and then it lingers on in landfills or floats out to sea.  It was recently reported that whale carcasses washing up on California\'s beaches had plastic tampon applicators in their stomachs, among other debris.No, I think Tampax would do better to improve upon their cardboard applicators which at least can be sourced from recycled paperboard or from sustainably managed forests.  Or perhaps I\'ll forgo the applicator all together and just use o.b. tampons."
117,117,20110208,B00284B56Y,5,"February 8, 2011",AP1TP992JS2CJ,"Compact, convenient, comfortable, and reliable...","What can you really say when reviewing tampons? As women we have all probably figured out what our favorite brands are and what features we find best to suit our particular needs. I use light absorbency tampons which for some reason are rather difficult to find in retail stores, and when I do find them they are typically 2 times the price of others and there isn\'t ever a generic cheaper version. I purchased this 3 pack of 20 count tampons because there was a coupon offered at the time and with subscribe and save they ended up only being around 3 dollars a box. I have always liked the comfortable plastic applicator of the tampax \'pearl\' series, the compact style (1/2 the size of a regular applicator tampon) is such a wonderful feature, especially if carrying in your purse and they\'re small enough that you could inconspicuously tote one around in your pants pocket if need be. Just in case any of you aren\'t familiar with how the compact feature works...you remove the 1/2 sized tampon from the wrapper, hold the bottom textured part of the applicator, then simply pull out the base piece which will lock into place once completely pulled out (it aligns itself behind the cotton tampon inside) then viola you have a full sized tampon to use! Very convenient! I guess that\'s everything :) Reminder to you ladies out there...always remember to use the appropriate absorbency for your flow or you risk serious injury, even death form toxic shock. I believe they should sell light absorbency tampons more places instead of forcing women to use regular absorbency due to lack of availability...it\'s very dangerous and very serious...I had a friend that nearly died of TSS and it is a horrible thing to go through."
42,42,20111222,B001LK6XHC,5,"December 22, 2011",A2GQ0WGM9BYX9O,MUCH needed variety and comfort,"We women know how it is, and to spare myself the agony of writing about something so personal I will keep this short: this is a great and economical buy for the main reason that your days vary and so will the amount of protection from mishaps you require. So Here are fifty tampons, 30 of the ones that are most commonly used for women with a regular cycle, ten for before and after the main part of it for the heaviest and lightest days. I will ALWAYS buy this pack from now on cause there is nothing worse than the dread that hits you when you don\'t have one when you need one and you\'re taken by surprise and duckwalking down the hall, now is there?  LMFAO!"

Does not light up, and is not magnetic enough.  Does not vibrate like my other four.  Also, my biggest problem has been smell.  Men run.  Run like my cat when he got out of the mattress.  Will not recommend to uncle."

With the boxes like this one that have several sizes/levels, though, I\'ve never had problems, and I really like how the three levels are available for the various points of your period.These are easy to use and insert, and comfortable.  The textured string also makes them easy to removed since they actually provide a good grip.The price on the 50-pack is also great, especially with Subscribe and Save; my local retailer charges about 1 1/2 times the cost that Amazon is charging.Overall, this is my favorite tampon, and I definitely recommend them."

Like all other Tampax Pearl the string is what makes this product amazing, since it prevents leaking. The applicator is also amazing, easy to hold and MUCH easier to use than the paper cardboard ones.I myself prefer the unscented version, since the scented smells a bit too strong and chemically."
140,140,20110308,B00284B59G,5,"March 8, 2011",A1AV2XXZB8CUPP,Great alternative to OB Ultra...,"Since OB has unfortunately stopped making their Ultra tampons, I was left with no choice but to find an alternative product (after YEARS of using OB).  After reading another review that referenced OB, I decided to give this brand a try.  As the other reviewer said, these are just as good as OB, and are a great alternative.  The shape is entirely different from OB  (sort of in the shape of a sting ray, once expanded), but still very absorbent and the thick braid string is a blessing. :) That is one major con about the OB ones, is that they only had a very small string, so it may not entirely be a bad thing that they stopped manufacturing them!Highly suggested for those seeking a replacement to OB\'s Ultra tampons!"
