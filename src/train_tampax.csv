71,71,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A2RX62V4E2BF5Z,I\'ll always be a Tampax Girl,"Tampax has always been my first choice tampon. I normally go with the normal Tampax, not the Pearl line. There are a few \'upgrades\' with the Pearl line, in addition to the quality and protection you know and trust from Tampax.Instead of the traditional paper wrap, these are in an easy to open plastic wrap. Tampax calls these purse-friendly, and indeed they are. We\'ve all found that torn open, slightly disassembled tampon at the bottom of our purse. You won\'t have that problem with the Pearl line. The multi-pack, for me, always runs out of mediums and leaves me with only the barely useful light and the super absorbency is just scary big.The blunt cardboard applicator has been replaced with a \'smooth plastic applicator and rounded tip for comfortable insertion\'. I won\'t say you can\'t tell the difference, but chances are you won\'t care. The difference is so insignificant that I don\'t find it worth the additional cost, both financially and to the environment. That is pretty much the story of the Pearl line. Like with the absorbent braid, I don\'t koow that the ever so slight amount of additional protection will ever, in your life, make even the slightest difference.The Pearl line, like the normal Tampax line, is great. For me, I\'ll stick with the less expensive, paper wrapped, cardboard applicators. BUT, if the added feature seem like they would make a difference to you, then go for Pearl."
21,21,20100831,B001G7QV18,5,"August 31, 2010",A128RU4O72TIN7,Convenient 2 pack and good price for the amount,Decided to buy the 100 count boxes because I know I\'m definitely going to use them. They end up being cheaper to buy then getting the smaller packs available at my local stores. It\'s also more convenient to have them available and I don\'t have to remember to buy another box every so often. I prefer the cardboard instead of the Tampax pearl because they can be flushed down the toilet and are biodegradable. I have used both and they work just as well.
96,96,20120405,B001LK6XI6,5,"April 5, 2012",AHUJB9FTS71RE,Great,"What I love about these:- Not too drying- Just the right size- Right amount of absorbency- Applicator is easy.I wish I didn\'t have to buy these, of course, but since I do, I am glad to have these as an option!"
127,127,20111222,B00284B59G,5,"December 22, 2011",A12ZDEYFMEWIZP,Highly Recommend now that OB Ultra is not available.,I would recommend this product to anyone that used to use the OB purple box Ultra.  Since they don\'t make that OB product now this works great!
12,12,20120201,B001G7QJRE,5,"February 1, 2012",A39WQT5X1DSGLL,Feel Great!,"These are perfect. They fit my vagina perfectly! I wouldn\'t buy another tampon if I was bleeding down my leg......(Christina Agulara.) I love the way they feel......(I have no lover, so these are all I have.) I use them even when I don\'t need them :)"
140,140,20110308,B00284B59G,5,"March 8, 2011",A1AV2XXZB8CUPP,Great alternative to OB Ultra...,"Since OB has unfortunately stopped making their Ultra tampons, I was left with no choice but to find an alternative product (after YEARS of using OB).  After reading another review that referenced OB, I decided to give this brand a try.  As the other reviewer said, these are just as good as OB, and are a great alternative.  The shape is entirely different from OB  (sort of in the shape of a sting ray, once expanded), but still very absorbent and the thick braid string is a blessing. :) That is one major con about the OB ones, is that they only had a very small string, so it may not entirely be a bad thing that they stopped manufacturing them!Highly suggested for those seeking a replacement to OB\'s Ultra tampons!"
60,60,20110914,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 14, 2011",A3FBM0RMCMAABV,Love the convenience,"My favorite thing about this box is the different sizes.  I was so happy when Tampax started packaging their tampons this way because at different times throughout my cycle I use different sizes.  I think most women do this, and normally we\'d have to buy 3 different boxes.  This box makes it so convenient with all three sizes included.  I love the ease of use too.  Tampax is the only brand I\'ll use."
73,73,20110906,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 6, 2011",A25RTRAPQAJBDJ,Great product.,My girlfriend says \'I love the variety pack of tampons! They come with enough of each absorption amount so that I always have what I need.  I have always loved the Tampax Pearl and would recommend them highly. The convenience of the variety pack is great!\'
134,134,20110731,B00284B59G,5,"July 31, 2011",A2OLIJAR21U6DS,Perfect for a very heavy flow!,"I absolutely love these tampons and I\'ve been using them ever since I was 13 years old. When I first got my period I was in complete panic. At first I didn\'t use tampons and I only used pads.. boy was that a nightmare! I somehow always got stains on my butt in school and every single person knew that I had my period lol. Super embarrassing... anyhow, thank god for tampons because I never had that problem ever again! I searched for the best tampon for about a week and finally got to these and never thought twice again, these are amazing. They are comfortable, easy to slide in, they absorb an amazing amount and I almost never even get a drip on my emergency pad/pantyliner. If you do not have heavy flow though I do not recommend these and they are pretty big compared to super and below. If you do have heavy for first days then they are perfect for that too and then just switch to a lighter absorbency when it gets towards the end of your period. These are awesome and the price is a good deal too. :)"
113,113,20110821,B00284B56Y,5,"August 21, 2011",A22I55P15NSAOX,These are the ones for your daughter to try as first tampons.,These are the ones for your young daughter to try to use when she first starts learning to use a tampon.  The plastic makes them easier to insert (also buy her some lubricant and have her stand up with her foot up on the toilet or even higher ).  The \'lip\' at the edge of the tampon makes it easier to grip as well. The LITES are smaller and easier for a young girl to use. The small size and individual wrapping makes them easy to put in a pocket.Use your own judgement to make sure that she is mature enough to remember to remove them at regular intervals.  But if she participates in sports/swimming/dance having this option is invaluable so that she can participate in her normal activities.
27,27,20100609,B001G7QV1I,2,"June 9, 2010",A1L8X5TUG6TIWX,An unnecessary new design ruined Tampax.,"I picked up a box assuming that this would be the same product I first tried several years ago... These are the worst tampons I\'ve used. You feel them after insertion. I kept going back to the bathroom because I felt like I needed to readjust. It never seemed to help. Very uncomfortable! Reviewers on drugstore.com have claimed that these actually gave them cramps. Ouch! The cardboard applicators, while being easier to manipulate than the nightmarish Playtex Beyond, can still be difficult. And I\'ve been flushing them with some apprehension even though the box says it\'s okay. Bad, bad, bad. They really effed up a classic brand here. Tampax tampons are inferior to just about every other tampon available now.Pearl is the only Tampax style worth considering...and even then there are cheaper and better tampons, such as Kotex Security, Playtex Gentle Glide, and Playtex Sport.I would only buy these again if absolutely nothing else were available to me."
45,45,20111013,B001LK6XHC,5,"October 13, 2011",A1GNYV0RA0EQSS,DEPENDABLE!,"This is like writing a review for deodorant. What is it we are all looking for in personal protection?  An item that is secure and dependable. I have been using Tampax Pearls for years and I love the Triple Pack that gives you all three - light, regular and super absorbent. I stick by products that I believe in and I think you will agree that Tampax is the one that wins!"
47,47,20110929,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 29, 2011",A4SD8F79JBYG2,The best,"I\'m in my early 40s and have been using tampons since I was 13, so I\'ve had lots of experience with different brands. I think I\'ve tried them all. These are, without doubt, THE VERY BEST. This package of assorted sizes is handy."
31,31,20081226,B001GCU10U,5,"December 26, 2008",APRWXSV2YXHHV,Gettin the job done.,"I ordered these pups through that automatic delivery system. It saves  my wife the hassle of running out and the price was attractive.  From what I understand, they are as comfortable as could be expected considering. I have not noticed any spotting on the sheets or in the laundry so I would say this product is getting the job done! Stoked."
80,80,20110831,B001LK6XHC,5,"August 31, 2011",A2V5R832QCSOMX,"Work great, and it\'s nice to have various sizes","I\'ve been using Tampax Pearls for about two years, and I\'ve only had some problems with leaking when I\'ve used the \'Normal\' size the first few days of my period.  With the boxes like this one that have several sizes/levels, though, I\'ve never had problems, and I really like how the three levels are available for the various points of your period.These are easy to use and insert, and comfortable.  The textured string also makes them easy to removed since they actually provide a good grip.The price on the 50-pack is also great, especially with Subscribe and Save; my local retailer charges about 1 1/2 times the cost that Amazon is charging.Overall, this is my favorite tampon, and I definitely recommend them."
161,161,20110816,B003CP13OM,3,"August 16, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Tampax changed the design- not very comfortable anymore,"These provide good protection, don\'t leak, and the applicator and wrapper are flushable and biodegradable. I definitely prefer to buy cardboard over plastic. Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion."
79,79,20110901,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 1, 2011",A36AIK1DQPSRNT,***A FAV PERSONAL PRODUCT****,"These are my favorites.  The assorted absorbency is a great idea, the plastic applicator allows for ease of use, and the large amount, at least in my case, means that they will last a while.  Not much more to say about a product like this and have it remain a rated G review!DYB"
13,13,20111128,B001G7QJRE,5,"November 28, 2011",A104W89DPJBJZF,Such a great deal,I am doing the subscribe and save and this is such a great deal. i get double the amount of tampons at half the price - these are the kind i normally buy in the store for ONE box for 10 dollars...
122,122,20120315,B00284B59G,5,"March 15, 2012",A1NWZYC0G025HC,a gift from heaven,"When OB discontinued the ultra tampons, I was nervous I wouldn\'t be able to find a replacement.  These are them! In fact, they work better than the ultras. The only thing that I miss is the small size of the ultras but these still are so much better."
0,0,20060131,B0000VCZ70,2,"January 31, 2006",A3K0V1E127XXQV,Ouch,"Tampax tampons have been the most uncomfortable tampons I\'ve tried.  Inserting them is hell, especially the cardboard ones.  Plus, I\'m a petite person, and I get frustrated with multipacks like these, because the largest tampon I can use is the regular size, so most of the tampons go to waste.  If you\'re petite, definitely don\'t get these.  If you\'re not, be sure to buy a whole bunch of lubricant to go with them.  I used them for years, but didn\'t know what I was missing: plastic tampons!  I recommend Kotex--much less of a pain, literally."
32,32,20090517,B001H99ZCC,1,"May 17, 2009",A3U1VH6NJMLJLE,Sometimes Change is Not Good,"After faithfully using this product for 34 years, Tampax went and changed both the applicator and the tampon itself.  The applicator change was good...the tampon change was not.  I have never had so many problems as I do with this new version.  And, the price paid here was $6 higher than at Costco.  These I will donate to a women\'s shelter. My quest for either older versions of the product or a different brand that works continues."
154,154,20101222,B0029NYQQA,4,"December 22, 2010",A3PKIEHWSWN4JF,These are good...,"They do take some getting used to. You must click it to get it right. Although, dont expect to hear a click more like feel it with your fingers. You dont have to push it in until you hear the click either. If its in all the way just pull out the barrel like you would do a normal Tampon. These are really small & cute. The boxes are discreet. The first few times you might leak a little bit but once you get the hang of using these, it will be alright. As every woman knows, you can always wear a little pad to help with the leaks. =)"
59,59,20110915,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 15, 2011",AIIR8E34EDKCQ,One of the better brands out there,"Tampax Pearl is way better than regular Tampax tampons, the applicator no longer feels like a torture device and they work great at night or during day, I also appreciate the different sizes even though I don\'t usually need other than regular, they\'re good to share if you have sisters and friends and there\'s nothing more annoying than running out, so this is great for stocking up.Just remember not to flush the applicator, plastic doesn\'t do well in the septic system :P"
102,102,20110811,B001LK6XI6,5,"August 11, 2011",A1FOX093BGKU3U,Best ever,This is the best tampon i have ever used. Very comfortable and easy to use. Glad it is available online and thanks for the fast delivery
77,77,20110902,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 2, 2011",A3EI4K5U61UZ7,Great variety pack,"Great variety pack for those periods when flow varies.  The plastic applicator is more comfortable to use than the cardboard, however it is obviously not as biodegradable.  The unscented variety is good for those with sensitivity to perfumes."
75,75,20110904,B001LK6XHC,4,"September 4, 2011",A3TP31S61PPE3G,Regular and Super work great -- the light is an \'eh\' for me,I like the packaging on the tampons - they are easy to open and to dispose of. The plastic applicator makes it easy to insert as well. The regular and super work very well - with little to no leakage except on the heaviest of days. The light you should only use for VERY light days as it has a tendency to leak onto the string more even with a very light flow. These had no particular scent or odor control.Overall another excellent Tampax product. Just use the regular for the lighter flow until it gets very light.
114,114,20110802,B00284B56Y,5,"August 2, 2011",APXFAU4THTNFJ,I love it,"As a previous reviewer stated, we all generally know what works for us. I decided to try compaks because the packaging is so much smaller and as a college student living in a dorm room, I need to save as much space as possible (and save money!). It\'s difficult to find these in bulk anywhere but of course Amazon had them! My packaging has a different design though. Instead of a purse, its a giant heart. Anyone who doesn\'t know these are tampons won\'t know looking at the box unless they look at the back where there\'s an image of the applicator. I know that\'s not a huge issue but if something can be functional AND attractive to look at, I am all for it."
42,42,20111222,B001LK6XHC,5,"December 22, 2011",A2GQ0WGM9BYX9O,MUCH needed variety and comfort,"We women know how it is, and to spare myself the agony of writing about something so personal I will keep this short: this is a great and economical buy for the main reason that your days vary and so will the amount of protection from mishaps you require. So Here are fifty tampons, 30 of the ones that are most commonly used for women with a regular cycle, ten for before and after the main part of it for the heaviest and lightest days. I will ALWAYS buy this pack from now on cause there is nothing worse than the dread that hits you when you don\'t have one when you need one and you\'re taken by surprise and duckwalking down the hall, now is there?  LMFAO!"

145,145,20120126,B00289683Y,5,"January 26, 2012",A2CT6DUIFOI2TZ,Life saver for women after babies!,Tampax has finally made a tampon for women!!!  Women tend to have heavier periods after having children.  These are a life saver.  It is the ONLY tampon that has complete protection and able to take the extra flow.  This is the next step if S or SP do not work for you.  They are wider than SP and probably hold 75% more.  I am very happy with the the Ultra tampons.  Everyone I have recommended them to have been very happy.

Does not light up, and is not magnetic enough.  Does not vibrate like my other four.  Also, my biggest problem has been smell.  Men run.  Run like my cat when he got out of the mattress.  Will not recommend to uncle."

66,66,20110908,B001LK6XHC,3,"September 8, 2011",A1WSQ0QRWQC7VI,i will say this,it\'s a tampon...it works but not s good as our usual brand. i like that it camewith a variety or absorbancy types in the same box but my daughter found them uncomfortable. personally i ouldn\'t buy this brand because it wasn\'t made or shaped the same way as our usual brand. i liked the quiet wrapper though.
133,133,20110826,B00284B59G,5,"August 26, 2011",A1E89L5LR30QH4,Great if you can\'t change often,If you\'re a heavy bleeder and have a job where you can\'t frequently change this is a GREAT product.  Lets you not have to be constantly changing and away from whatever long activity. Great for travel or a full day at the amusement park or a long hike!!!

That got me thinking and comparing prices. This packaging of 2 boxes of 100 count each, was the best deal per each. Plus free shipping from Amazon. This was a lot cheaper than buying it from a pharmacy or a grocery store. And! This is important! The shipment came in a plain brown box, no markings on it. Although I found it funny that after my purchase Amazon offered me to post my purchase on Facebook: I just purchased 200 Tampons. :) No thanks."

49,49,20110928,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 28, 2011",A3CNM18PWKI1Z9,Nothing Beats Tampax Pearl,"In the world of tampons, no brand can beat Tampax. No matter how hard they try, Tampax\'s competitors never manage to reproduce the 100% hassle-free experience of Tampax. They always mess up one thing or another while Tampax manages to offer solutions to every single aspect of your menstruation.At the same time, in the world of Tampax tampons, Tampax Pearl, in my opinion, is the very best. It\'s the most comfortable, easy to use variety of Tampax. I think it\'s a brilliant idea to sell this kind of variety packs because you can just buy a 50-count box and use it for several menstrual cycles in a variety of situations.Tampax has surely done a lot over the years to make women\'s lives easier, and I salute them for it."

At least for the week or so each month you\'re on your period, like me, so about a 1/4 of your life!! Now, given, I only use them for a couple, maybe three days, but no more leaking after one hour, two, or even three! And, amazingly, they seem to be a better shape than the super (orange) pearls, so hold better and feel better, too. I used these for the first time in when I found them in Colorado and was thrilled. But, for the life of me, couldn\'t find them in California where I live (what, do the CA buyers think it\'s an \'altitude\' thing? CA buyers, get w/ the program!). Though I am not a regular Amazon shopper, I stumbled upon them and was thrilled at a good price, and TWO boxes. (trust me, you\'ll want two. Who wants to run out?) I hope other ladies who try them are as happy as I have been with the results. Don\'t ditch the liner or pad yet, but don\'t panic after 45 minutes either. Good luck!"

However, these tampons just didn\'t say put. It\'s likely they are too small for me (insert crass joke here). I am 35 but have not had a child. I used the \'Super\' ones (which are the biggest in this pack) and within an hour or so, they had just kinda worked their way out. Since the \'Super\' ones weren\'t cutting it, I know there\'s no way I can even try the smaller ones. Sadly, this box will be a waste for me.I do like the plastic applicator however.

One thing I noticed is that the string always irritated me. By the end of my period I would always be irritated down there and I didn\'t know why. When I figured it out, I switched to Playtex Sport, BIG DIFFERENCE, Playtex Sport\'s are SO MUCH more comfortable and better than Tampax Pearl, and the string isn\'t irritating.Plus, one of my friends used to use Tampax Pearl\'s and the string came off and she couldn\'t get the tampon out."

I\'ve tried many different brands/types but Tampax Pearl always comes out on top. The plastic applicators are much more comfortable to use than the cardboard applicators many other brands use. I love the multi-pack because I can choose which absorbancy will suit me best for that day without having to buy 3 separate boxes. I\'ve had problems with other tampons not fully opening up and absorbing like they are supposed to, but I\'ve never had a problem with these (or a leak!). I would definitely recommend that if you haven\'t tried these already, you should. You won\'t regret it."

Super plus are good but often you want more protection just in case if you are at work or in public and can\'t run to the bathroom every hour! Are these new?

I like the size assortment in this box, but  I will buy a box of Tampax Pearl Super Absorbency for the heavy days, and keep these for the days where my period fluctuates."

I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."

It is also great being able to order them from Amazon since not many retailers carry them in my area. Don\'t forget to see if there is an Amazon coupon. I got an additional discount both times I ordered from Amazon. Thank you Tampax. Thank you Amazon."

I\'m no longer going to waste extra tissues wrapping the applicator up to hide in the trash.  And think about all the waste I am reducing.The only con about this would have to be the fact that they have blunt tips.  The cotton is exposed at the tip and it is not tapered.  It can be uncomfortable when inserting.

The applicator is very smooth and easy to insert unlike the cardboard applicators.  Obviously, this isn\'t good for the environment but I prefer these over the flushable applicators that usually clog my toilet.  The insert itself is comfortable enough.  I was skeptical of the braided string, however, I learned the hard way that the braid really does help with some leaks.

The Unscented tampons here are a great idea. The plastic applicator is also easier to use than others I\'ve tried, which are always much too thin in the \'grip\' area, causing (TMI ALERT) painful stabbing and pinching.I\'ll probably gravitate back to my usual cardboard Tampax, but this product is definitely a good value for those who prefer plastic."

You can\'t predict how many of each type you\'ll need each month and I find myself using one that\'s not quite right just because it\'s all I have or because I have too many of one kind and am trying to finish them up.

Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion. Kotex is a reasonably priced brand that is more comfortable to remove than these."

I find I use lots of Ultras the first part of the period, a bit of the super and regular absorbancy for a short time in the middle and then lots of lights at the very end.  So a multi-pack with mostly Regulars does not help me much.I have used these and the Pearl version and find they both work very similarly, except these are a bit more ego-friend;y with cardboard applicators.  I have to be honest, these are the only size I buy with cardboard, any other absorbancy is a bit uncomfortable for me.  I go through the most of these anyways and it takes a bit of the cost down.Why not get these in bulk?

As women we have all probably figured out what our favorite brands are and what features we find best to suit our particular needs. I use light absorbency tampons which for some reason are rather difficult to find in retail stores, and when I do find them they are typically 2 times the price of others and there isn\'t ever a generic cheaper version. I purchased this 3 pack of 20 count tampons because there was a coupon offered at the time and with subscribe and save they ended up only being around 3 dollars a box. I have always liked the comfortable plastic applicator of the tampax \'pearl\' series, the compact style (1/2 the size of a regular applicator tampon) is such a wonderful feature, especially if carrying in your purse and they\'re small enough that you could inconspicuously tote one around in your pants pocket if need be. Just in case any of you aren\'t familiar with how the compact feature works...you remove the 1/2 sized tampon from the wrapper, hold the bottom textured part of the applicator, then simply pull out the base piece which will lock into place once completely pulled out (it aligns itself behind the cotton tampon inside) then viola you have a full sized tampon to use! Very convenient! I guess that\'s everything :) Reminder to you ladies out there...always remember to use the appropriate absorbency for your flow or you risk serious injury, even death form toxic shock. I believe they should sell light absorbency tampons more places instead of forcing women to use regular absorbency due to lack of availability...it\'s very dangerous and very serious...I had a friend that nearly died of TSS and it is a horrible thing to go through."

Ok, well this is going to be a bit personal.  But what I like about these are they do easily glide in, they are not as long and weirdly shaped as regular Tampax and some other brands and they just \'fit\' better. Also, they expand properly in the width and absorb well, so I have not had any worries about leaking.  In addition, its a nice bonus that this pack comes with three different sizes to use as your flow changes. These are unscented- perfect for those of us who don\'t like those flowery perfumed scents.

120,120,20120402,B00284B59G,1,"April 2, 2012",ATKTQFZSQLVSQ,New leak guard is awful,I have used this brand for many years. They rarely leaked and you could flush it all. Until now. The leak guard is SO irritating!!! I have thrown out two boxes and bought playtex. Someone didn\'t do their research. I can\'t seem to find new tampax without the leak guard \'skirt\' and so I won\'t be buying these until Tampax realizes that women do not need skirts on their tampons.

I love the smooth plastic applicator but I too had a problem with these staying put.  I guess they are too smooth for me.  I have a heavy flow the first few days so I tried the super size first.  I had to wear a pad with it to contain the leaks.  I recently tried the OB brand super size and they are perfect for my heavy flow days.  They do not fall out and they contain the leaks like no other.  I did use this multipack for my lighter days and got by with just a pantiliner but I can not get past having them fall out when I go to relieve myself.  I do not like having tampons in my septic system and I do not want to have to fish them out.  I have had two children so maybe these would have worked better prior to childbirth.
142,142,20101211,B00284B59G,5,"December 11, 2010",A21K28EQ023UUU,awesome,love the product (that\'s why I gave it a 5)! shipping though was disappointing...they stuffed both boxes and boxes were crashed! like they\'re trying to save$ or something. That\'s not what I expect when I pay for shipping!
70,70,20110907,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 7, 2011",A3FBMSWBJ202SF,Best tampons,"I tried the other brands and always came back to Tampax. It\'s so well designed in every single way. Obviously, a multi-pack is perfect for each period.The applicator is smooth and easy to use. The super ones are good for heavy days. Their super plus is even better for overnight/heavy flow.The environmental issue is the only flaw I\'d point out for it. Otherwise, I have been having wonderful experiences with Tampax for years."
151,151,20110825,B0029NYQQA,5,"August 25, 2011",A3G55NZ2MOUOQK,Great for when your out and about!,"I ordered these to have an alternative to carry with me when I was in class or at work. They are perfect for hiding away in your purse, bookbag, etc. VERY pleased."
110,110,20120117,B00284B56Y,1,"January 17, 2012",ATMMHGCOW9BDV,Horrible,"I absolutely HATE these tampons. It\'s irritating that it\'s impossible to find light tampons anywhere, which is why I decided to try these. First of all, the applicator is pretty crappy and can be painful. It\'s not very smoothe at all and the actual tampons get super long and kinda huge once they\'re inside and that was really painful for me. Because of how weird and long they get, they would start to come out (without even having absorbed anything yet!) and rub weird and hurt even more :/"
17,17,20110708,B001G7QRG2,5,"July 8, 2011",A2QNHF6YQIU82P,Tampax lites,I ordered the tampons from Amazon because it was cheaper than buying them in the store and they came right to my door for free.  Sweet!
24,24,20120110,B001G7QV1I,5,"January 10, 2012",A2JST3B1JUFH46,tampax,They get the job done. What else is there to say? I just wish I had gotten plastic instead of cardboard
11,11,20110313,B001G7QJQA,4,"March 13, 2011",A1NOEAO9V65ZAH,Good product.,"Welp- it\'s a tampon. What can I say. It works great, but occasionally I feel like stuff gets by on the lighter days- how that works I wouldn\'t even know. It does the job on heavy days. Case closed."
155,155,20101106,B0029NYQQA,4,"November 6, 2010",A3N07JANJ8PWI9,Takes getting used to,"Well, they take some getting used to. What I have learned and was hoping to find info on before purchasing: They come with the applicator stick already in the tube and per instructions you have to pull it out till it clicks and then when inserting push it back in until it clicks. Great idea for making them take up less room and not get ruined in your pocket or purse. They are a little more flimsy then the regular ones so you have to be careful. Also, the first one the stick fell into the toilet. I have been careful with the rest, strategically holding them, but the rest have not really seemed as loose so it might have just been a fluke thing. They take a little getting used to and I haven\'t seen them in super plus yet, but I will continue to use them when I don\'t need the plus."
103,103,20110803,B001LK6XI6,4,"August 3, 2011",A2F09EWKV3MTO2,Good tampons but wouldn\'t buy on a regular basis,"In general, these are good tampons, easy to insert and comfortable. I don\'t like that they have a plastic applicator and wrapper though, and would prefer something biodegradable. They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case). But for those of use who have used them for years and know what we\'re doing, I find the plastic applicator unnecessary and wasteful."
22,22,20120216,B001G7QV1I,5,"February 16, 2012",A1UC50DYFPSXYD,These are the BEST!,"It\'s a weird to review a feminine hygeine product. Anyhow, I\'ve used these for twenty years. Love them. They are the most reliable tampons out there. I actually really like these better than the \'Tampax Pearl\' ones, as I can\'t stand the closed top and plastic applicator on the \'Pearl\'. These are my tried and true brand. I will never buy another. I also love the mix pack for the various stages of my cycle.I also am a subscribe & save fanatic! I save money, but I really just appreciate saving so much time by not having to go to the store. We always stock up on stuff and used to do so at a club store. Now we just use subscribe & save. On items like these, where you know you\'ll be buying them periodically for a long time, subscribe & save is awesome!"
52,52,20110923,B001LK6XHC,5,"September 23, 2011",A1IW1ANBV0DPVI,Best Tampons Out There,"I LOVE Tampax Pearl\'s - so many other brands try to duplicate this product but they just don\'t get it exactly right - the durable, strong wrappers that can hold up in any crowded bag, the ergonomic applicators w/ no slip grips on the sides, the super absorbant cord - they\'re the best, love these tampons, and I love these assorted packs - it keeps you from having to buy a separate box for heavier or lighter days - what a great way to save some coins."

35,35,20110708,B001K3IH06,5,"July 8, 2011",A2QNHF6YQIU82P,Tampax Slender Regular tampons,"I like the slender tampons because they have the same absorbency as the regular-sized ones but go in a little more easily, especially if you have a light flow and have trouble getting another tampon in when you have just removed one.  Amazon\'s price was better than I can get in the grocery store, plus they don\'t always have this size available there.  I also got free shipping, so I had nothing to lose."
26,26,20110820,B001G7QV1I,4,"August 20, 2011",A1FQGF3LUM0HU3,What is there to say beyond great price?,"They\'re Tampax tampons. I\'m not going to get into the particulars, but they\'re the brand I\'ve always used, and likely always will use. The subscribe & save price is great and the shipping was amazingly fast."
136,136,20110524,B00284B59G,5,"May 24, 2011",A2T8JLXZ1WMXSU,Good Product,"I have no complaints with these. They are comfortable and easy to use. Absorbency is good, but I always use with a pad, for added protection."
