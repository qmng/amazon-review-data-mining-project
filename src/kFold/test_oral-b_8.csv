2136,2186,20110317,B002HWS9GG,5,"March 17, 2011",AN63CPS7LYC4M,Money well spent,"Considering the dentist gives regular toothbrushes out for free, I never thought that I could ever pay over $100 for a toothbrush! However, I feel this has been the best money spent for dental preventative care.  It cleans so well, and has features like the excessive pressure monitoring and timer that are wonderful. Plus, I walked away with a huge smile from my dental checkup yesterday!  I absolutely missed this toothbrush when on vacation, and couldn\'t wait to get home to my SmartSeries 5000 so I could get that ultra-clean feeling again!"
163,166,20090630,B00006ANDK,5,"June 30, 2009",A3KZK8M94R50A0,Good Dental Check ups,This is an excellent product.  It is gentle on gums and teeth but does a very good job of cleaning and also controlling the formation of plaque.  This results in minimum \'medieval\' type of cleaning with a sharp tool or the use of ultrasonic cleaner that they just love to use just above the gum which results in less discomfort after a vist to the dental hygienist.  I recommend it highly.
463,471,20101108,B0002KHTG6,5,"November 8, 2010",A4BHPFO74SCHA,Great Value!,I am really happy with these brush heads.  They are great for keeping stains at bay between trips to the dentist for cleanings.  My teeth are smooth and shiny.
2205,2255,20110116,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 16, 2011",A3MPOPREPBPUR9,"Amazing cleaning, wonderful quality, and great price... Very happy!","First of all, a comment on the price...This is an amazing price for the Oral-B 5000. I just saw them yesterday (Jan. 15, 2011) at my local Target store for 159.00 with no rebate offers. So, getting one here through Amazon for under a hundred is a great buy! Not only was 96.00 a great price, but mine also came with a 50% mail-in rebate offer, which was a nice surprise. So, after that I will have only paid 48 bucks! Awesome! My girlfriend also got the rebate with hers. I don\'t know how long the rebates will last, but even without the rebate, this is an excellent price, and well worth every penny!After reading all the reviews here, and talking to my dentist about it and hearing his recommendation, my girlfriend took the plunge and ordered one a couple weeks ago. As soon as she tried it, she fell in love with it. She told me how good it felt on her teeth, and how clean her mouth felt after using it, and how she really looked forward to brushing. I immediately ordered mine the same day.My first impressions on the build quality...After opening and unpacking mine, I was immediately impressed with the build quality of the unit. The brush handle is solid and seems very well constructed, and the head that holds the brushes seems strong. I fully expect this to last a long time, and hold up really well. It\'s also attractive to look at, and the batteries last a long time on a full charge.This model comes with a separate wireless display unit, that displays brushing information while you\'re using it, and functions as a clock when you\'re not brushing. It displays a timer that will countdown from 2:00 minutes, or count up depending on your preference. It also shows the quadrants of your teeth for a visual reminder to make sure you get all areas. It displays which brushing mode you\'re using, and will flash a warning if you press too hard.Is the display really necessary? Perhaps not... The brush unit will vibrate each 30 or 45 seconds to remind you to change to the next quadrant. And it will stutter when the time is up to let you know you\'ve completed the recommended time. But, it is nice to have those visual cues where you can see them easily, and it is nice to have a small bathroom clock handy. So, I really like the display unit a lot. I think it was a nice addition, and I think most people will appreciate it.My impressions on actually using the brush...I\'ve had mine only a week so far, but I love it completely! I honestly think this is one of the best investments in my health I\'ve ever made. I\'ve never taken care of my teeth like I should have, and I have several fillings to show for it. I\'ve always tried to brush at least twice a day, but they were always short, quick brushes, by hand, and not very thorough. And I never thought I would be excited about brushing, until now.Now, I love brushing. I look forward to it. I brush at least three times a day, and never less than two minutes each time. I love how long the battery lasts, so I can take it with me to work, or on trips. This brush really makes it easy to stay on top of brushing. I can feel how thoroughly each tooth is getting cleaned, and it feels good on my teeth and gums. I haven\'t experienced any discomfort using mine.After brushing, my teeth are literally squeeky clean. It really does feel like a professional cleaning. It\'s only been a week with mine, but I can already notice a difference in their appearance. I\'m excited to see how they will look after a couple months.One last thing I really like is the carrying case that comes with it. It holds the brush firmly in place, and two brush heads firmly in place. Very convenient for carrying with me.This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I can\'t even imagine going back to a manual brush. I highly recommend this, and I\'m sure you will enjoy it just as much.Hope that helps..."

This one is harder than the original one - I know it\'s supposed to be hard - and it took me sometime to use to it. If you don\'t like a hard brush, you may want to choose other brush heads."

I purchased this to replace an old Oral B electric I had had for approximately fifteen years . . . and I used it daily until it died of old age.  While I always felt my teeth were clean with that old version, it truly *cannot* compare with this new and improved version!  I cannot express the difference in just how clean my teeth feel after using the 5000.  I considered the Phillips Sonicare simply because it is recommended by my dentist and orthodontist, but after reviewing the Oral B 5000 and seeing what it had to offer as far as options (not to mention all the rave reviews from other users), I decided to stick with the Oral B and I am glad I did.  It\'s truly an excellent product."

They begin to wobble and get loose after a short time of use.  I doubt that they are true Oral B replacement heads.  I\'ve never had any problems with the store bought heads, other than the high price.  I won\'t buy more."

We really do like how they clean the teeth and gums.  We haven\'t had them long enough to see if they whiten like the ads say, but they do clean.  The whitening is usually the toothpaste anyway. We took them on a long weekend and didn\'t take the chargers.  No problem. They held enough charge for four days\' use.I would recommend these to anyone."

It has two modes for normal and sensitive gums. And also vibes every 30 seconds to help you clean all the areas equally. I was also surprised by the battery life - it\'s extremely long. I\'ve been using electrical brushes for several years including other oral b products, but they\'ve never shown such a long battery life.Good brush, recommended."

Once it goes in your mouth the floss breaks the moment it touches any teeth.  I\'m not sure how Oral B can put their name to this piece of junk. The worst part, the floss often tares apart in shreds (when it doesn\'t break entirely), leaving threads of this stuff stuck in between your teeth.  So, you have to use ANOTHER one to get the first one out. Often times you end up shredding that one in the same spot and need to try again using just enough pressure to make it between the teeth, but not too much that it leaves another thread stuck there.  Very frustrating.Plackers are the ONLY ones I\'ve ever used that simply DO NOT BREAK. Although the name is a bit disgusting, the product is amazing!  http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Micro-Mint-Flossers-Count/dp/B0013NFZQW/ref=sr_1_1?rps=1&ie=UTF8&qid=1332738296&sr=8-1"
2601,2664,20100906,B003UKKH6O,4,"September 6, 2010",AC24H4N4HYNU5,Nicely priced for a first-time user of an electric toothbrush,"This is my first electric toothbrush. I am extremely happy with it. I would recommend it as an entry-level electric toothbrush to those who are too unsure about the technology to pay for one of the more higher priced models.Full disclosure: I received this toothbrush free as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, at the low cost of $29.99 I probably would\'ve bought it anyway. I think it is definitely worth that price for a first-time electric toothbrush.PROSCLEANING: My teeth get much cleaner when I use this toothbrush versus my traditional one. They feel smooth, just like I came from the dentist. Flossing also seems easier while using this toothbrush because, with the right tilt on the brush, it is better able to clean between my teeth and at the gum line, so there seems to be less tartar buildup when I floss.WHITENING: The stain removal is EXCELLENT. My teeth are not that stained, but during the 2 weeks I\'ve been using this brush, I\'ve noticed a *significant* decrease in the yellow stains near my gum line.BATTERY: This may sound odd, but I liked the way the battery ran out. I was a bit concerned about what would happen and how I would handle it (the instructions give no clue). It pretty much just stops working, no wind-down at all. I liked that because it left no mystery as to \'will it or won\'t it\' finish and I just finished brushing my teeth with it manually. I\'ve used this toothbrush 1-2 times per day for over 2 weeks now, and I\'ve only had to charge it once.REPLACEMENTS: The brush indicates when it needs to be replaced via color loss on the bristles (just like some traditional toothbrushes do). It does come with an extra head, as well as a $3 coupon for another one.CONSDROPLETS: The only negative on this toothbrush is probably just due to my inexperience with electric toothbrushes: it sprays toothpaste droplets onto my clothing. Now I try to brush my teeth before I dress, or else I drape a hand towel over my blouse while brushing.VIBRATIONS: As others have mentioned, the vibrations are INCREDIBLY strong on this toothbrush. You should NOT press it hard against your teeth; just lay it gently onto them and let the brush do the work for you. My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive (I have several cracked ones) and once I stopped pressing with the brush, I had no problems with pain due to the vibrations. However, the vibrations DO make my nose ticklish.Unlike other reviewers, I have NOT experienced any \'gunk\' buildup in the toothbrush stand because I always rinse off my toothbrush the way the instructions say to. (If you put ANY toothbrush back in its holder without rinsing it well enough, you\'re going to get \'gunk.\')Overall, I would recommend this as a fine first electric toothbrush, especially at this price point."

With the subscription discounts and coupons, it was around half as expensive as the local store - well worth the risk. Thankfully, the heads we got weren\'t fake - they had the serial numbers, two colored rings and no color bleeding. I\'m not sure if the fakes are off the market or not, but if you\'re on the fence just order, then give Amazon a call if the ones you get aren\'t genuine..."
180,184,20120220,B00006ANDQ,5,"February 20, 2012",AV7EN7PZV0E3O,Received GENUINE Oral-b product,"I, like so many others, have unknowingly purchased fake oral-b brush heads in the past.  The reviews that discuss the fake oral-b products note that the product was purchased through a third party vendor in the Amazon Marketplace (or E-ba*) and not directly through Amazon.  Those reviews also state to confirm that the product you are purchasing is sold by and shipped from Amazon.For this order, I did just that.  And as a result, I am happy to report that after buying this 4-pack of Oral-b brush heads through Amazon directly, I received the genuine oral-b product - made in Germany.  In the local retail stores near me, only a 3-pack (made in Ireland) is available for this price.  Also, the $5 coupon helps as well.No more broken/wobbly brush heads after two weeks of use as I experienced with the fake product or having the metal pin break out of the back of the brush head and end up between your cheek and gum.Again, do like I did.  If it is sold by and shipped from Amazon, you\'ll get the real oral-b product."

2517,2576,20111204,B002HWS9GG,1,"December 4, 2011",AN7JYG5S08D7,not a good moder 5000 and I never received rebate,"The toothbrush is good as oral B is good. But few complains about this specific model 5000.1) The handle on 5000 is much bigger than on other similar toothbrushes. It is less comfortable to hold in hand.2) The extra device coming with model 5000 is useless. It is supposedly an \'advanced\' timer which makes beeping noise when you need to switch sides of teeth to brush and when to stop brusing. I think, timers embedded in the toothbrush handle itself (what they do for less expensive models) do better job - there is absolutely no benefits to have timer separately (in addition it\'s screen is hard to see).3)The electric plug on this toothbrush is much longer than on other models. The base, though, is much smaller. Apparently they moved electronics from the base (where toothbrush stands) to the plug. It does not look good when plug is plugged in recepticle and it makes dificulties always to avoid pushing the plug.4) Another big complain - never received rebate. it was $50 rebate for this toothbrush when I bought it in August. I filled all forms and send them in. But, until today I do not have rebate. I opened case with amazon and will give you update if I get rebate eventually. I see these toothbrushes constantly going with rebates (there is $20 rebate now)."
1567,1605,20081228,B001CX4JSS,4,"December 28, 2008",AV4EJCRPY3AV6,better than expected,"Received my Pulsonic about a week ago, and so far I\'m pleased with the performance, looks, and size.At first, the clean mode was a bit much to take and felt uncomfortable; but after a couple of days on the sensitive mode I\'ve eased into the clean mode quite nicely.The main reason for the initial discomfort is attempting to use the Pulsonic as a regular toothbrush. By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations. Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.Looks and size: nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).I would recommend this product to my family and friends."

The first one lasted about 15 years and was still working well when I ordered this new one.  I should be receiving a 50% rebate from Oral-B making the cost quite reasonable.

Almost all the reviews for the 1000 said the pressure sensor didn\'t work or was innefective. So I ended up getting the Vitality ($24.99) instaed of getting the 5000 ($119-149) that I would not have been as happy with. I spent hours looking for a review that told me this exact info so, you\'re welcome. This brush is fantastic, the Floss Action head can be a little aggressive so I am getting a pack of Precision heads (they are super cheap, like $14 for 3) for back ups but most days I will use the Floss Action Heads because I felt \'dentist clean\' afterwards. I did read some reviews that said the heads wrer a little large, I have a small mouth and while the heads are thicker than a manual brush it was by no means unmanageable or uncomfortable. This is a fantastic product and I am here to let you know my Sonicare is now in a landfill and I don\'t miss it one bit. My wife loves the Oral B Vitality and I am logging in to get one for my kids as soon as I am done with this review."

I liked Oral-B and wanted to try one of their high end models. I am very glad that I did. It is a noticeable improvement in power and cleaning.

1515,1551,20090909,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 9, 2009",A1FK14ZCV3B1RA,Nice toothbrush...,"I have tried a variety of the cheaper battery operated toothbrushes in the past.  The Oral-B Pulsonic was my first venture into the higher end toothbrushes and I must say it is very nice.  Let me first say I am not big on reading directions on most products before I try them out.  So, after a few days of brushing, I went to the directions to see why my new toothbrush kept pausing or hesitating after a couple minutes of brushing.  Low and behold, it\'s a feature designed to let you know it\'s time to move on to another part of your mouth...very nice.The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.  The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  I have found the button placement may not be located at the best spot for some people.  While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  The brush is thinner than other brushes I have used.  I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  Also, the brush head is much smaller with fewer frills than other sonic brushes I have tried.Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.  I cannot say if this toothbrush out pulses the competition or does a better job of cleaning, but compared to the previous brushes I have tried this one is twice the price.  In my opinion, this is a great toothbrush.  It all comes down to personal preference."

This brush does a great job of thoroughly cleaning your teeth w/o hurting your gums.  The timer that directs you to switch from one quadrant to another, every thirty seconds is a good reminder.  And the red light that flashes when too much pressure is applied is quite handy.In addition to switching my toothbrush, I also changed my toothpaste to Jason\'s Healthy Mouth.  After using the new toothbrush & toothpaste for approximately three months, I visited my Hygienist for a cleaning.  Unprompted, she told me that I had the healthiest teeth/gums of any of her patients.  And that assessment still holds true after almost two years.One last note:  If you\'ve got a youngster who needs to learn to brush all quadrants w/o applying too much pressure, purchase an extra toothbrush head and let your child give it a try.  It worked for my guy."
1588,1628,20080925,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 25, 2008",A3DOPYDOS49I3T,Small and lite....,The Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very lite compared to other power brushes I have used. It is also nice and small. It comes with one regular brush head and a precision tip brush head. The precision tip works really nice to clean in between teeth especially the hard to reach back teeth. It has a clean and sensitive speed. I can\'t really tell the difference between the two but if you have sensitive teeth I am pretty sure you will. It also comes with a charging stand. It is small and holds to brush heads. It has a small profile so it wont take up a lot of counter space. It also has a mount where you can screw two nails on the wall and mount the stand on the wall. The brush does a great job of cleaning my teeth. Especially between the teeth using the precision tip. The brush heads are very easy and fast to switch. It is simple to clean. Overall I like the brush. A travel case would have been a nice companion to this set.

This toothbrush is part of a Chinese Government Conspiracy to clog our landfills with Consumer Junk.  :)  The unit wouldn\'t work right out of the box.  Some issue with the charger, appearently.  Braun would want me and others to believe that the quality issues with this unit are just an isolated incident.  Sorta like a lightning strike, I.E. an act of God.  Ignorance might be bliss but knowledge also is power so as a Reliability Engineer I know that failures such as these quite simply need not occur.  I conclude that Braun either doesn\'t care about quality, or has organizational issues that precludes implimentation of a quality control program. Anyway, I will ship the unit back for a refund and continue to use my 10 year old Sonicare."

The body of the toothbrush is lightweight, it tells me when it\'s time to stop brushing, and the polishing head REALLY gets those black tea stains off my teeth.The polishing head might be a little too vigorous, because it actually hurt my gums in one area where I brushed too hard. But if you\'re careful, this is a great toothbrush head on a fantastic toothbrush. I\'m definitely seeing better results than usual.I also really like the small size of the stand.

Let me say I have been an electric toothbrush user for about 15 years and this is probably the first brush that my mouth and teeth feel really clean and tingly after each use.  I am not the most dedicated of flossers but this electric toothbrush with it\'s Floss Action head does the trick.  The bristles are firm and get between the teeth to remove that heavy plague and gumlines.  I am not advocating this as s DEEP cleanser for that you probably need one of those electric at home Waterpik\'s, but this is the next best and cheapest alternative.While I am not big on rechargeable electric toothbrushes because I believe they are a bit passe, I won\'t discount this brush for being that, and matter of fact the rechargeable unit is not big and clunky as they use to be 10 years ago.  The package comes with two replaceable heads which according to instructions should be replaces every 3 months.  There is also a guide to selecting other replacement heads based on your needs, whether that be flossing, polishing, dual cleansing, precision, or for sensitive teeth.Good product, highly recommend."
2418,2474,20100520,B002HWS9GG,5,"May 20, 2010",A2BMBMCFE23RCV,Worth every penny at Amazon\'s price.,"This will be a long and detailed review. If you don\'t want to read it all, I give you this quick summary. Great product, well worth the price at amazon. Best clean you can get and has many useful features. I have never had healthier teeth and gums. Read further for more details.This product is simply outstanding and in a class of it\'s own.I had a situation in which my gums are not in their peak condition, and that is putting it lightly. I have had this toothbrush for just a touch over two weeks. I also drink coffee every day, only 1 cup though. Since I have been using this, my gums are already noticeably healthier, my teeth are whiter, and I find it easier to make sure I brush at least twice a day. I think this is mostly because of how much I invested into this product. At this point I have nothing but good things to say about this toothbrush.I also have my wisdom teeth fully grown in and this toothbrush is small enough where I am able to reach them and give them a proper cleaning. My wife is also using it with a separate brush head.The device takes a full 10 hours on initial charge before use, as seems to be normal for most NiMh batteries. At first the backing on the timer is a bit confusing and difficult to get off as the instructions do not help. Once you figure it out though, It is quite easy to master.Positive feedback:Now onto a more descriptive part about the features this offers. Since my gums are sensitive to begin with I can only use the normal clean and sensitive options until my gums are healthier. The other modes are a really nice feature that I plan to use when I can.The included 2 sided tape is nice for when you want to mount it to the wall.I really like how both the toothbrush and the timer give you an indication of when to switch quadrants in your mouth every thirty seconds. The timer will blink and display that you should be working on the next quadrant. The toothbrush pulses every 30 seconds and pulses 3 times every 2 minutes. (I personally don\'t think 30seconds is enough for each quadrant so I often spend more time after brushing to give my whole mouth a quick once over.)Once you get the timer set and mounted it does make a nice restroom clock as other have said. After charging and setting the timer, the toothbrush is easy effective and gives the best clean I have experienced sans a dental visit.Also a side note, I asked my dental hygienist which toothbrush they recommend for electrical as they said I should get one. This one came at the very top of their recommendations. Before this I was using Oral-B\'s cheap $20 electrical toothbrush. The difference is astounding.The container for the extra toothbrush heads is very nice allows you to let the head dry out while not connected to the handle. They brush heads are very easy to remove and clean. The different color rings are very helpful if you have more then 1 person using the same style brush head.The travel pack is a really nice and touch and is compact too.Best clean you can get without visiting a dental hygienist.Negative Feedback:The back plate on the timer is a bit unwieldy at first.The toothbrush is a bit loud but not as loud as the $20 dollar variants.IT would have been nice if the battery came pre-charged. It would also have been nice if the timer also came with a rechargeable battery solution.It is expensive and costs way too much at a standard retail store($150).It only comes with 2 brush heads."

As a loyal Oral B user (Triumph 9900), I must say that my expectations were high and I was a bit disappointed by the performance of this instrument in comparison to my Triumph 9900.On the positive side is the form-factor which is fantastic, it is nearly as light weight and compact as a standard (non-electric) brush.  It is the perfect size for travel.On the negative side are the following:(1) The brush quality.  The brush quality is on-par with my earlier Oral B brush (which now retails for around $35).  Additionally, the brush head is more traditional and I tend to favor the rounded head found on most Oral B brushes.(2) The charging station.  Not nearly the high quality that I would expect.  Made from light-weight plastic, it feels cheap.(3) The price.  This product would be perfectly priced at around $45 and is a bit expensive at close to $70."

All I used was the floss action brush head.After using the Oral B continually for about 3 months, I can say that the (oral B) delivers a much more powerful clean. Though the Sonicare was easier to reach the back teeth.  Both delivers a clean, smooth just left the dentist feeling.This thing is way thicker then my old Sonicare E series handle, the pictures on amazon don\'t show the side shots.  And compared to the latest and greatest sonicare, it\'s probably double the thickness.  Go to your local retail store to compare, if thin is in for you.The smartguide clock thing is pretty heavy and thick as well, keep that in mind if you want to find some way of wall mounting it.  If you have it free standing on your sink its hard to read unless your eye level (I\'m 6 3) or stand back a foot or two.  And , although some of the back is rubberized, it won\'t lean against your wall without falling.  I use fun tack to overcome this.  It comes with two sets of AA batteries, which was pretty worrysome to me because most companies don\'t even give one set but it is still going strong.  It\'s neat to know how far in you\'ve brushed and when to switch quadrants, and the \'studder\' helps better then the audible sound the sonicare makes. Smartguide will count up and down for you.Brush heads seems much cheaper then my sonicare.  A 6 pack in my local warehouse club costs $30.  About $15 for a 3 pk on Amazon, and even cheaper with subscribe and save.It charges a bit quicker then my sonicare.  The charger base is really tiny, takes up very little room.  It even snaps into the included 4 user toothbrush tray.  However, even when it\'s done charging the wall wart (power brick thing) stays slightly warm (warmth=energy consumption), so I\'d advise you to unplug after charging.."

I bought it to replace a brush that cost over $150 and it does a better job. The small, rotating head easily gets to the gum line of even the rear teeth.  Only negative is that there is no low battery warning so it will die in the middle of a brushing episode if you don\'t regularly plug in the charger-stand. That\'s a small inconvenience - one not worth $100+.  Just in case, on the day the Oral B is recharging, you can always use the brush given to you by your dentist at your last visit, unless you used it for cleaning grout."

NOTE: the annoying part about the smartguide is taking off that darn battery cover! other reviewers weren\'t exaggerating about that at all! the clock on mine is still an hr behind since i couldn\'t remove that stupid battery cover to adjust the time.i\'ve only used two brush heads so far, whitening and floss-action. i\'m not sure if the whitening head really whitens like a whitening strip, but at least mine aren\'t staining even without using whitening toothpaste. the floss-action one doesn\'t really \'floss\' well. when you start off, it might be a good idea to use the sensitive or whitening head since the bristles are softer and more gentle on your gums until you\'re used to the \'power\' of an electric toothbrush.overall, i do love the toothbrush and even bought a couple additional ones for my family as gifts. so, i definitely recommend it."

I mean, it\'s a toothbrush after all. WRONG. Once you\'ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you\'ll never go back.Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  Always have.  Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  However, I went ahead and gave it a try.In less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  I put on the toothpaste and away I went.  The best thing is the size of the rotating head: it\'s about the size of a tooth.  Gee: what a novel idea! As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  This allowed me to work on my teeth while moving towards my gums.  In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.One of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth. This was something I could NEVER do with a regular toothbrush.  I also have some very deep pockets in my gums that have a tendency to hurt and bleed. However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  Oral-b is a reliable brand and this is in keeping with the brand recognition.  I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  It\'s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera! ;)"

The Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is relatively inexpensive, and, from my perspective, is all the toothbrush I need.

The Amazon service on this order was typically beyond reproach."

The Braun manufactured brush comes with the recharger base and 2 floss action brush heads for under $30 from Amazon which strikes me as, perhaps, the best bargain of all available powered brushes on the market because of the high quality and effective design.I\'ve been using the Sonicare system for roughly the last three years and I do love it, but the handle is bulky and the brush heads are expensive to replace.  I always have wondered if there was anything out there that was as good or better?  Enter this system...It actually seems to clean every bit as good, maybe better, and it makes my gums feel much more \'alive\' than the Sonicare does.  Judging by sink remnants it truly does clean at least as well, if not better.  I\'m guessing the floss action heads are truly small engineering marvels as they do seem to actually do what the name implies.  The size of the head suits me well after initially getting use to it.  That, combined with the more svelte handle allows me to easily get to the back of my teeth quite easily, better than the Sonicare IMHO.It is impossible to ignore that this system comes in noticably less in cost than the Sonicare too.  I\'ll still, on occassion, use the Sonicare, but this is my new favorite because it\'s effective cleaning and I really love the better stimulated feeling of my gums.  In fact, I will just say it:  I feel my teeth are cleaner and my gums much more invigorated with this winning product.  For me there are few downsides to this unit that I can think of.  Maybe the only thing I\'d like to have seen added was a brush guard, or holder, for sliding around the brush head when traveling...Otherwise, Oral B has hit a real \'homerun\' with this product which I feel works great, I enjoy immensely, and is a decent bargain too."

At first I was afraid to open the packaging because of all those reports about brush heads having no repacement ring, having an oral-B insignia with a grey background, and made in Germany are counterfiet. But, eventually I opened the package, and nothing is wrong with the brush head. It is Not a Tongue Mutilator, nor does it have out of shape bristels, not is it a counterfeit. All those pieces of information are either false, or just one time bad experiences. My brush head still has its shape maintained, isn\'t too hard and hasn\'t done anything funky. I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time and I just like it. If someone has a smaller than average mouth then, or if you\'re one of those people who was used to small brush heads back in the day (when you used conventional brushes), then this brush head is not for you. Otherwise its a wonderful brush head and it definitely beats the precission brush head by far (I haven\'t used the floss action brush head yet so I dont know if that one is any better)."

2633,2697,20120328,B003UKKHB4,4,"March 28, 2012",AT1A4VABGBB2H,Oral-B and Periodontal Disease!,"Hello All,I figured I would finally rate the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush now. I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this product.First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910. This electric toothbrush was great. I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare. My only gripe was the replacements are a bit on the pricy side. Moving on, I decided to replace the Sonicare (gave to my wife) with the Oral-B 3000. My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line. Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.As an owner of both, I find them similar in a sense, that they are both out (the toothbrushes of course) to perform the same job. The Sonicare did its job just fine. However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch. Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it\'s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.Onto the Oral-B. This brush has performed great. The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease) so I don\'t bleed as much. The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare and I really see no difference other than the size of the head. Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean). I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip. Although, it\'s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work. Plus, I always rinse the brush afterwards with hot water.The battery life appears to be great. I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days. The vibration and strength is great the company claims (40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute). The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \'off\'.The toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation. The build quality seems good to me. I have dropped this toothbrush three times over the span of three months and the electric toothbrush survived without any visual damage or cracks.The charging does take quite some time until it is fully charged. However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night. Therefore, the brush has hours of charging before its next use. One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG. This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first. Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit. Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don\'t even really notice it.In closing, I like this toothbrush. I gave it four stars because while I think it\'s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let\'s face it, it\'s a toothbrush right? Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road). Both the Oral-B and the Sonicare, have their difference. But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease. I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I do.And remember, I do NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can\'t go wrong either way."

It\'s not that I didn\'t brush after every meal when I was doing it manually; it\'s that these toothbrushes do a significantly better job. Furthermore, although their use has never actually whitened my teeth, it slows down the degree of stain accumulation from tea, coffee, etc., so that I do not have to bleach my teeth as often.Having said all that: This model does not work any better than my trusty Oral-B S-200. It also has the same drawback, that the rechargeable batteries do not last forever and when they give out, you must buy a whole new unit. When in use, the toothbrush sounds louder than the S-200 and different, resembling a dentist\'s drill.  For anyone thinking of using older heads they have around, my S-200 heads do not fit on this model--the shaft is different.

2840,2915,20100916,B003UKM90Q,4,"September 16, 2010",AEVSRK7S3K8QU,Perfect Price Point for an Electric Toothbrush,"I\'ve been looking at the more expensive electric toothbrushes -- Sonicare, and higher end Oral-b -- for quite some time, but could never pull the trigger when for the same price, I can practically buy a lifetime supply of manual toothbrushes.  I\'d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it\'s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you\'re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.I have one implant, and some \'erosions\' on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it\'s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.Don\'t throw away that manual toothbrush, though.  There is still one mouth maintenance chore that the Oral-b does not handle well -- brushing of your tongue.  The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \'tooth\' brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  If you check my other reviews, you\'ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed."

Haven\'t they improved on this over the years?  I\'m still thinking about returning it because the sound is a bit jarring.  Also, if you have sensitive teeth or gums, forget it.  You probably WON\'T like the toothbrush heads that come with this brush.  Thankfully I bought another set of brushes:  Braun\'s \'sensitive\' toothbrush heads.  These brushes are much softer, and should arrive as a set like this to begin with.Update:  I do like this toothbrush, but only in conjunction with Braun\'s sensitive toothbrush heads.  Cleans teeth VERY well! A+"

944,963,20110107,B000AUIFCA,4,"January 7, 2011",A1FVN80HHHR3RA,"Nice to use, may not be for everyone","So I\'ve been using the Oral B Floss Action heads on my Oral B I\'ve had for about 4 years now (still going strong!), and overall, I\'ll say I like it.First, the bristles are stiff, much stiffer than even the regular replacement heads. This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives. While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.Second thing to note, this shouldn\'t be a flossing replacement. You\'d think it\'d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely unnecessary.Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.So, with that, you\'d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right? Well, maybe not. For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn\'t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush. I don\'t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn\'t feel radically different from using a medium bristle brush.These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth clean.Finally, these heads seem to fit my teeth perfect, but I should note, I have a large mouth and large teeth. As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they\'d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/mouths.All in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone."

Then one day the evil nemesis time took it all away as my Sonic powered toothbrush ceased pulsing its distinctive sound of a million mad mosquitoes.  My wife, as she is wont to do,never wanting anything to do with my inter-spatial toothbrush saw this as the opportunity to finally throw it in the trash. For days it lay in state at the bottom of the can. It was a vision of pure sadness as I knew that now, once again, my elbow must flex and my hand once again must clench the minuscule handle of (gulp)...a manual toothbrush. The thought of losing another energized brush kept me away so for years I maintained only memories of the mad mosquitoes that once blasted calculus to the oblivion. If I had only had that Sonic brush in Mr. Farkner\'s math class, I often thought, perhaps I would have passed. I spoke often to my wife about finding another sonic calculus blaster but this brought only glares. For, as I have previously stated, my wife hated every tiny sonic wave of it\'s tiny brush and nearly forbid it.As I sat in the body conforming chair of my dental hygiene adviser, mirror in hand, viewing my pearly off-whites the bad news came; word by grating word; \'You\'re a lousy brusher\'. These words came from a mouth I could not even see.  Was it true? Is this why she protected her mouth from mine with that veil? For the second time in my life I learned calculus is no fun as she told me I must return for two whole hours of scraping. And it was all my fault. \'This\' she proclaimed after quickly unveiling her mouth \'is an Oral-B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush. and it alone is the answer to your inadequacy\' Wow, it was a mouthful and I was not even sure I could utter that many words without removing the cotton from my cheeks but I still tried. \'A mmmpphh, mmmphh\'. I gave up protesting further only in my mind. \'But it has no sonic drive!\' I though. Seeming to read my thoughts she smiled and curled my fingers around the handle. \'It has modes, lots of modes, and the brush is big, big enough to massage your gums, and who doesn\'t like a gum massage...right?\' I pondered her words as she veiled her mouth again and scraped her way slowly through my calculus problems.As I left her presence, and all the way home on the bus, her words rang in my head. At the first opportunity I searched the World Wide Web for the best price and found a quick trip to the Amazon was in order. I pushed the right buttons and soon it arrived, wrapped incognito in it\'s brown cardboard box with that winky smile. Inside, nestled against it\'s plastic air pillow my new toothbrush rested from it\'s long journey. The air was electric as I pulled it from it\'s packaging and plugged it in. I hung it\'s cordless timer on the wall. I could hardly wait to massage my gums but the book clearly stated I must so I did. When morning came I grabbed the handle. No more clenched fist around a minuscule handle, this baby was large, form fitted to my hand and pulsed with excitement. I pushed the button . The brush came to life. Gone was the sound of a million angry mosquitoes on a mission of blood replaced instead with a sound of raw rotating power. The sound was humanly audible and no longer called dogs from every outside quadrant. At first my elbow still flexed back and forth, as though I were to do the work, but I soon learned I need only relax, position the brush over each tooth and let the Oral-B work. The timer on the wall counted up the seconds. Thirty seconds later the brushed pulsed on and off and I was off to attack a new quadrant.  In just two minutes I was done. The brush had solved my calculus problems for the day and the timer even smiled its approval. Awesome!"

I purchased they for the rest of the family and my 11 year old is doing a much better brushing.I\'ve never had any problems with this toothbrush running low on power, even when I\'m away from home (and the charger) for a few days.Original Review: (Sept 2010)I\'ve been using the Oral-B power toothbrush for a few weeks now and I\'m very pleased with it. Other electric toothbrushes did an ok job, but they usually had problems with getting gummed up with residue or lacked much in the energy department.The Oral-B power toothbrush has a brush head that\'s about 1/2\' in diameter that consists of a small rubber cup in the middle and is surrounded by bristles on the edges. I\'m able to maneuver it easily to the every tooth surface and get the some spots that I couldn\'t get to with a conventional brush. I find that I\'m able to get away with using about half of the toothpaste I did before. As a result, much less is wasted and there are no excess globs of toothpaste getting washed down the drain.One feature I really love is the inductive charging base. It doesn\'t have any exposed contacts, which means the brush is easy to rinse off after I brush. The base is easy to keep clean for the same reason.The power switch is behind a flexible rubber part of the grip and is easy to turn on and off. The brush isn\'t especially quiet when it runs, but that\'s not a big deal. It\'s not deafening either.It\'s doing a great job keeping my teeth cleaned with much less effort than a regular brush. I\'m very happy with it."

I like the size of these brushes.  Many electric toothbrushes only have the small round brushhead, which feel small in my mouth and feel like they are not covering the whole tooth.  These brush heads are more like the size of a traditional toothbrush but with the power of electric toothbrush.  I feel that they have great coverage and great cleaning power."

When I brush with an electric toothbrush, I want to be able to slowly move my toothbrush around while the cleaning power of the toothbrush head does all the work and leaves my mouth feeling dentist clean.  That is not the experience I have had with the pulsonic.  Although the brush head vibrates significantly and loosens plaque, I find I\'m having to perform the laborious back-and-forth to the extent that I do with a manual brush.  Electric brushing is supposed to be fun and easy!  Oscillation is key, and this brush doesn\'t have it."

Clearly they got the source of the stain wrong, and I\'m not so sure about the brush.My research led to the purchase of the Oral-B 3000.Oral-B and Sonicare seem the brushes of choice, and my research gave Oral-B a slight edge, though I\'m reconsidering. Reading reviews also gave the Oral-B floss action brush head a slight edge, and I\'m inclined to agree; though it certainly doesn\'t replace regular flossing, so far it seems to be keeping the staining abated.The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist\'s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. Primarily, the mode switch is a source of frustration, for the brush can not be shut off without going through all three modes. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000."

I do not, however, like the pro white heads that came with the brush. I bought the precision clean heads and love those. They are made to work with the Vitality. This is only packaged and called the Vitality Pro White because it\'s the vitality model with pro white heads... Any heads made for Oral-B will work with this except for the Sonic heads.This brush is great, although it seems it\'s a bit underpowered. When brushing my back teeth and trying to get behind the tooth the motor isn\'t as powerful as it you were just brushing the front teeth but it\'s fine it still does the job just fine. I leave the brush on the charger when not in use so I can\'t attest to how long the battery lasts. Oral-B says that it will last 20 minutes or about 10 2-minute brushing periods. I personally think that\'s low for a modern electronic toothbrush but I leave it on the charger so I don\'t have to deal with a low battery.I brush at minimum 3 times a day. Usually more. I contacted my dentist asking if it was bad and she said that it\'s fine and I told her I was using the Vitality and she said that it was no problem, \'brush as often as you\'d like\'.. So I\'m not worried about gum recession or ruining my tooth enamel with it.I moved from a manual brush to the electronic brush and found at first that the vibrating (oscillating?) was making my gums and the tip of my nose tickelish. I\'ve gotten used to it and it doesn\'t seem to affect me like that anymore.I do drool a lot when brushing and the toothpasty drool goes down the handle on the brush and makes the handle a mess, so I rinse it off half way through and after brushing. The brush is completely waterproof, although I wouldn\'t submerge it...So all in all I really love this brush and rate it a 5/5. We\'ll see in 6 months how my brushing habits are when I go in for my next cleaning. I try to be very thorough and usually brush at least 3 minutes to make sure I get every nook and cranny so if I have tartar that is an unusual build-up I\'ll modify this review.I recommend this brush 100%!"

My teeth feel cleaner, and I hope my breath is more pleasant.  It gets the hard-to-remove film from the teeth, and does not require the hard brushing of a regular toothbrush.  The bristles initially felt too hard, but it\'s just a matter of getting accustomed to the toothbrush.Although this toothbrush cleans the teeth well I cannot emphasize enough the importance of continuing to floss between the teeth.  The timer that comes with the device is not necesssary as there is a slight change in speed after each 30 seconds of brushing, but I do find it helpful for me.I keep my brush on the charger, but find it works fine without the charger when I\'m out of town over a week. If you keep it plugged in make sure the brush is seated properly or it will overheat. When used in conjunction with the Oral Breeze Quick Breeze (faucet attachment) it makes for a really clean-feeling mouth.

Firstly, it isn\'t dependent on batteries; it\'s rechargeable, which is great, so you dont have to spend money buying batteries every few weeks. Secondly, this model can be used with a few different brush attachments. the floss action is nice because it has a small head, which makes it easier to get to the hard to reach back molars. If it\'s too small for you, you can always use one of the bigger head attachments (not sure which ones go with this model, but I\'m sure you can find out on the Oral B website or somewhere here on Amazon). This leaves my teeth cleaner than any brush I\'ve used. They feel as clean as if I had just come from the dentist! The battery life is great too!

It also helped at the time that there was a 50% rebate from Oral-B (which was received in 3 weeks, not bad for a rebate). So for one, it was a good deal at a post-rebate of $54.99.This was a perfect set-up for my husband and me. It came with a floss head and I already had a whitening brush head. When we unpacked, we set it up next to the counter plug (I don\'t like to have wires spread everywhere) and placed the timer on the mirror at my eye level.The timer shows a round diagram (to represent your mouth) and it times 30 seconds a section. Then you get a big smile and a wink for the time after 2 minutes. The timer display also shows what mode you are like normal or gentle and if you are brushing too hard.The brush has been working well for both my husband and I. The brush does make noise, and since there is not doorseparating our sink from the bedroom, I do have to go into the enclosed toilet/ bathtub room to brush when my husband is sleeping. Also, there is only one brush so you either have to brush one after another or use another oral-B professional brush, which we already had (the Professional 1000).My husband dentist thanked him for flossing (which he doesn\'t), and my dentist said that my gums looked a lot healthier and my teeth were very white. My dentist even is going to order me 2 new brush heads every time I come in (about every 6 months) instead of the standard toothbrush.I would recommend this brush to everyone. I know that all can\'t afford them, so I tell them to watch for rebates, when you can get them cheap. They save you at the dentist (with less cavities). To get my white fillings, it cost more than this toothbrush, retail."

I have used this brush for a week, and have had gums bleeding and swelling (NEVER any problems before, and yes, I floss daily), teeth getting more sensitive and less clean feeling afterward (they can feel quite clean, but you have to brush twice the recommended time, which is detrimental to enamel and gums), and this head makes a huge mess!

I used to use the Sonicare Elite 9500.3. I just opened the package yesterday evening and have used it twice so far.4. I needed a new brush because my old brush\'s battery died.*Brushing*Pros1. I am happy with the cleaning that I am getting.2. The brush feels like it is massaging my gums.*Charging*Pros1. This brush is dual voltage and will work both in 110v and 220v areas.2. This base of the brush seems much more stable than my  Sonicare since it is a little wider.*Traveling*Pros1. The brush does include a travel case.2. Since the travel case is plastic, it will be much easier to clean though compared to the cloth Sonicare case I had.Cons1. The travel case is MUCH larger than my old Sonicare.2. The travel case appears that it is more likely to break since the plastic hinge area seems like it can wear down.3. The brush heads do not have a plastic cap to help protect the bristles.  I liked that the Sonicare had this option since I was reassured that nothing dirty was touching the bristles while transporting it.*Operation*Cons1. I could not figure out how to get the brush to offer an audible cue when switching quadrants while connected to the SmartGuide.  It only offers an audible cue when the radio is turned off.*Cost*Pros1. This brush is much cheaper than the latest Sonicare.2. Replacement brush heads are much cheaper than the Sonicare (by about half the price).*Maintenance*Pros1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush heads appears that it will be much easier to clean unlike my Sonicare which always had a lot of buildup that was difficult to clean.Cons1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush head is a relatively small metal rod.  I am concerned that if I drop the toothbrush, this may bend and I would be unable to load any brush heads.2. On either side of the brush, there is a section with a silver coating.  Unfortunately, this stains easily with water stains.  I wish that Oral-B had used something that would help avoid the water stains.Overall, I am content with the brush. I wouldn\'t consider myself a Sonicare convert since this isn\'t perfect either, but I plan on keeping this brush."

We\'d sing the Tigger song while brushing, which helped make things fun. But I have a couple complaints:1. The whole thing is a little large and cumbersome for a 3-year-old. Getting the back teeth is tricky for him, and when we take over to \'do finishing touches,\' we\'d always end up bonking him on the teeth/ gums/ lips with part of this toothbrush. This made him mad, and when you are trying to convince a toddler that toothbrushing is fun, you do not want to make him mad.2. The brush head is not replaceable. So once the bristles are worn, you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one. Sure, the purchase price is cheap, but like so many things, that is not the \'real cost,\' once you factor in how many you\'ll have to buy and how many you put in the landfill. (Batteries are replaceable but the toothbrush is not rechargeable.) I recommend getting one that allows you to replace the head and keep the Tigger.We are now looking at the Sonicare kids toothbrush, which is much more expensive but which includes two different-size brushheads for growing with-- and bonus, it\'s rechargeable."

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  The number after the dash (for example EB17-3) just means how many toothbrush heads you\'ll be receiving.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads."

Another feature I like is the pulsing every 30 seconds.  It is supposed to be for those who divide their brushing between 4 sections of the mouth, upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. Since I like to do the back side of my front teeth together, instead I took the first 30 second pulse as, \'Ok, you\'re halfway through the top,\' and the second as a cue to move to the bottom.It\'s amazing, how much I had to force myself to stay on the top a full minute.  I didn\'t even realize I was brushing the lower teeth more.  I recently had a cleaning where I was told my upper back teeth had more plaque than lower. Now I know why!This will keep you even in your brushing time throughout your mouth, feel great, give you a terrific clean, yet be gentle.I was SO pleased that I got one for my hubby.  We have separate bathrooms, or could have easily shared the handle.  He didn\'t do the full two minutes on our old version, but on this one he is.

I have owned each for about 8 months now and I have to say that each brush has its own pros/cons and this is her favorite.  The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior/interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes some adjustment on the part of the operator.  I found that my gums could handle the Sonicare, but my girlfriend gums are more sensitive and she uses this Oral-B exclusively.  The motion of the brush is much more softer and the replaceable brushes tend to fit right over each tooth.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  I like having the ability to brush my tongue which is much more difficult with this brush."

After a few weeks of exclusively using this toothbrush there was no noticeable whiteness difference for my teeth. It was easy to use and there were no issues with it. I chose to return to the Sonic and will keep this one as a back up. The reason for this was due to the brush head since I had already picked up a replacement pack. I really don\'t see how one could go wrong with either brand\'s lightweight sonic model. I think in choosing it will come down to which one is on sale or even color/style preference.

Now like I said, I\'ve never used one before, so maybe they\'re all loud.  When I say it\'s really big I mean the base part of the toothbrush that you hold on to.  It\'s very thick/wide and is weird when holding in your hand.  My in-laws have electric toothbrushes that are much thinner, but I don\'t think they\'re as high-end as these.I\'m wondering if the additional thickness is from a better battery in this model because the battery lasts quite a while before you have to recharge it.Overall, I think this toothbrush is very good for even the normal price.

I have the more expensive model that briefly stops every 15 seconds so you know when to change quadrants in your mouth.I got this  \'Vitality Floss Action\' brush and have to say that for the money I think one would be hard pressed to find a better buy.I agree with the other positive reviewers on all the important points but most importantly to me is VALUE. This toothbrush does an excellent job of brushing and massaging the gums. Furthermore, I believe there are different specialty brush head replacements that can be purchased. It DOES have a two minute time. In my opinion this is just as good if not better than having a 15 second timer. If you just brush your whole mouth for the full two minutes you\'ll get just as thorough and perhaps more so than if you do 15 seconds peer quadrant because you\'ll have almost as much paste on the brush for the other quadrants of your mouth. With the 15 second per quadrant type of brushing, by the time you get to the final quadrant you\'ve pretty much used all the fresh tooth paste.This is a bare bones electric toothbrush. It doesn\'t come with a travel case but I love it and see no reason to spend an extra $100 for a fancier Oral B or the other leading competitor."

However, this \'rebate\' is not cash back or a true rebate where the money is refunded to you; rather, it is in a form of a prepaid Visa which annoyed me greatly because instead of getting money back into your accounts, you are forced to spend money on a card that also has Account Maintenance Fees. I was livid as I discovered this this morning after speaking to the Oral B rebates rep who also apparently \'just learned\' about the rebate policy changes.

Tip, if you want it to last 5 years or more, remove it and clean it soon after making your coffee, at the latest, when you have finished all the coffee in the carafe.  DO NOT bang it against anything to remove the old grind and DO NOT leave the hot soggy grind in the filter for any length of time, and NO dishwasher!  To prevent the oil build-up on the mesh, simply rinse with cool water outside-in ASAP, and place upside down in natural lit area so as to prevent mold. As mentioned before, the mesh even without the plastic support frame or gold finish will deliver the quality coffee taste as when new and outlive all your coffee makers and your taste buds too!"

Both are somewhat expensive but certainly worth it because my only expense since using either one of the devices at the Dentist\'s office is for the annual pofessional  cleaning.  Healthy gums with no new cavities or bridgework that needs to be done make these kinds of devices well worth the money.
2675,2744,20100826,B003UKKHB4,4,"August 26, 2010",A1RIQUDE4B8NGX,First time electric toothbrush user.,"After over 40 years of life, you sometimes find the need to try something new and different and abandon the habits of old. So goes my old fashioned \'manual\' toothbrush for a newfangled electric model. Okay, so I am not so old that I actually talk that way, but sometimes change is hard.As this is my first powered toothbrush, I cannot offer any comparison to models of old, but I can tell you that using the Oral-b 3000 is surely a different experience from just plain old brushing. First off, the round head shape definitely seems to do a great job of cleaning teeth; its shape allows for the bristles to envelope the tooth and I can feel its cleaning efforts at work. And, for those of you who have a tendency to scour their teeth with a toothbrush and scrape off the enamel, the Oral-b 3000 comes with a pressure sensor that will warn you when you are using too much force.Overall, my mouth feels cleaner after just a few days of use and I can tell it will likely make a difference in my dental hygiene.Something to note... If you have a high fear of dentists and their tools, then you should be aware that using the Oral-b 3000 will sound like you are in the dentist\'s chair. Nothing to fear, but it is a little shocking for the unprepared."

But 3 month ago I couldn\'t find it in any supermarket then I bought this one. Shipped pretty fast, looked good. But then, having used it for about 2 month, the tip became very loose and I have to be very careful as I brush my teeth, for it could pinch my tongue or mouth!! I even bled for a few time. Yesterday I got to remember that before the blue color on the bristle would lose gradually, indicating when you need a new one. But after about 3 months, the color on this one was not lost at all (my husband is using it too, so neither was his). I seriously doubt whether it is real oral B. Be careful!"
2640,2704,20101127,B003UKKHB4,5,"November 27, 2010",A140FKZ6NPM5QE,Excellent Toothbrush,Bought this toothbrush after reading the great reviews on Amazon and am quite pleased with my purchase.This toothbrush replaces a 12-year-old Sonicare. I was truly sad when the poor ol\' guy bit the dust. After a week without an electric toothbrush I realized I needed to get another and researched Sonicare vs. OralB/Braun. I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn\'t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 & 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I\'m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn\'t expecting that big of a difference.The only thing I don\'t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn\'t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn\'t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.

It arrived within 7 days and I\'ve been using it ever since.  I originally had planned on purchasing a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush but after reading many different reviews, decided on the Oral-B instead.  The clock/timer is a nice feature, makes me more aware of how much time I spend on different sections of teeth.  The motor hesitates when too much pressure is applied which is also a plus for me as I have a tendency to press too hard.  I\'ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don\'t use the stand that it came with but it\'s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn\'t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I\'ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.  Also, I already received my refund card from P&G as well, which was much quicker than some other people had reported in their reviews.  I would definitely buy another if this one went bad and would recommend to anyone looking to purchase this type of toothbrush."

My dentist advised buying the least expensive toothbrush as they are all very similar.  My sister\'s dentist informed her the same.  She obtained this toothbrush and recommended it to me.  I have liked the toothbrush very much.  It, particularly, has a far reach and does a much better job than my manual toothbruch.  This is a great buy for the price (less than $30).  It even comes with an extra brush as they need to be changed periodically.  I have never owned another electric toothbrush to compare this one to but I am very happy with this one."

The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare\'s."

I have been using Oral-b products for years and knew they are a good product.  I do not need all the bells and whistles they offer and this one had everything I need.I have been using it for about a month now and really like it.  It holds a charge really well and it came fully charged.  The 2 minute dentist recommended time indicator is great.  I find I brush longer now and pay more attention to each area because I know I will be reminded when it is time to change areas.  I have used a smaller toothbrush for years and found this one to be a perfect size brush as well as the handle is not that much bigger than a manual toothbrush.  The only thing that I don\'t love is the cord is in the base - not detachable so the base needs a larger space to accomidate the cord.  Not a large space but more than it would if the cord was detachable.I would definately buy another or recommend it to others.

By way of full disclosure, I have been using the Oral B Cross-action toothbrush for a number of months, and in the past I used a Sonicare toothbrush.For whatever reason, I keep seeing more and more electric toothbrushes lately, each of which is supposed to be the \'latest and greatest\' design.  Frankly, I can\'t see the difference between many of them.  Maybe there are incremental changes that make them worth the sometimes excessive cost, but who knows?  And of course, manufacturers seem to be pretty generous with dental offices, which seem to either display the Oral B brand or Sonicare, or both.  But I suspect that the results between the various brands are pretty similar.This toothbrush is very similar to my Cross-action, the key differences being (i) it lacks the cross action brushes below the oscillating head, (ii) it has a 2 minute timer, and (iii) it\'s rechargable.  Frankly, I prefer the cross-action brushes, but that\'s not crically important.  I do really like the 2 minute timer, and the fact it\'s rechargable.  It does a good job cleaning, and the timer is a nice feature.From my perspective, I don\'t think that the brushes that sell for $70+ are worth the money.  Far from it.  The Cross action does a fine job on my teeth, and this brush is pretty comparable, with the added plusses of being rechargable and having the two minute timer.  So I think this is a good buy for the money, and I would recommend it.  I also like the fact that there are a variety of different heads available for it, including ones that floss, are gentle, etc.I\'d say that this brush is a very good value for the money."

2237,2289,20101213,B002HWS9GG,5,"December 13, 2010",A2CCL5RDYG0X5N,Great rechargeable toothbrush,"I think most people would agree that the 2 minutes spent brushing your teeth are the longest 2 minutes in the day, however many times per day you brush.Dentists insist that I use an electric toothbrush, otherwise I brush too hard and add to gum recession.  Most dentists put the Oral B\'s at the top of the list, and I\'ve been very pleased with them, but this new one is a leap forward.All because of a simple improvement: it not only divides the mouth into quadrants and gives a little shake to prompt me to move from one quadrant to another, but it has a separate wireless display.  When the brush isn\'t in use, the display serves as a darned good digital clock, and when brushing, it converts into a timer and a map of the four quadrants, depicting which quadrants have been brushed.  Then, once the two minutes have passed, the round quadrant display turns into a smiling face, which grins if you\'ve really been brushing enough.And it\'s the darndest thing, but breaking it up into 4 quadrants not only shortens the perceived brushing time dramatically, but I for one--yes, it\'s embarrassing but true--actually want to \'please\' the display, and get that silly smiley face.  Worse than that, I want to get the big grin on the smiley face!No, I\'m not lonely, I have a lovely girlfriend who brushes right beside me, but we both find that these Oral B\'s turn the longest 2 minutes of the day into an all too short game that seems to last at most 30 seconds.  And the cavity-free dental exams are nice, too.The only negative point: as is the case with all previous Oral B electric toothbrushes I\'ve owned, after even a single brushing it seems to take impossibly long to completely recharge.  I don\'t have any other rechargeable appliance that comes close.  It\'s not much of a problem, but it does seem peculiar."

After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up. Unfortunately i cannot tell you if they will last a long time since i just got mine about a week ago but i can tell you the difference between the two brands.The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you\'re not trying to, just when you\'re normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you\'re doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B\'s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i\'m brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B\'s. It\'s a bit annoying.The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy ine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They\'re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, but i\'ve yet to see how often they break. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They\'re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you\'re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain."

Good for people who scrub too hard with the traditional toothbrush, therefore damaging your teeth (that is what my dentist told me the problem I had), eletric toothbrushes like this one prevent you from brushing too hard, and more efficient. Teeth feel really clean after using this toothbrush heads.Price wise, it is much cheaper than the price in local drug store, plus you don\'t need to pay sales tax here, big saving."
