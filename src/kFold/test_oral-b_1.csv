1649,1692,20110423,B001CX4JSS,5,"April 23, 2011",A37GL1Y144G91B,Love it!,This is my 1st sonic toothbrush and I\'m addicted to it. A whole other level of clean. I just wish they had a traveling case.
2916,2996,20111019,B003UKM90Q,4,"October 19, 2011",A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,"Great product so far, but incomplete instructions","The timer is weird and unexplained.Six months ago my dental hygienist said the only way I could furtherimprove my dental hygiene was to switch to a good electric toothbrush.She was reluctant to recommend a specific brand except to say that itshould definitely have a two-minute timer.  I went to ConsumerReports, and the ones they really liked were pretty expensive, so Istalled, and then forgot about it.  This time my hygienist broke downand recommended the Vitality, which I found for less than $30.  I wasvery glad to see that this generation of electric brushes doesn\'trequire a big box, just a small recharger.The instructions were a bit confusing, and there was no clearindication of there being a timer or how to use it.  The word \'timer\'is printed near the on/off switch, however.  The first time I used thebrush I was about 75% done when the brush pulsed for a second. Ithink that\'s the \'timer\'.  That has continued to happen every time Ibrush with it.  I\'m pleased to know that apparently I\'ve been brushingmy teeth for well over two minutes all along.Update 5/7/12:  After more than six months I can say that my teeth andgums are definitely healthier.  My hygienist announced that I have atruly clean mouth.  I actually enjoy using this product.It\'s definitely easier to use than a manual brush  It\'s convenient,and came with an extra brush head.  I\'ve now switched to the extra sensitive several days, so one could just leave the charger behind for briefbusiness or weekend trips.  If I were truly intense about dentalhygiene I could even bring the brush to work every day as it\'s not atall large or heavy."
593,606,20060423,B0002KHU3I,5,"April 23, 2006",A2V7EO331SFUF6,A great addition to the Braun brush head selection,"I got one of these with my last Braun replacement, a 7850DLX set. At first, this veteran user of the EB17 Flexisoft head was a bit skeptical. But after a few days use, I have a new favorite.The dual-brush head is a bit bigger than the traditional round head. The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars. But this head is great for quickie between meal cleaning, and as a bonus is pretty good at brushing off my tongue.This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure. Since EB17s usually run about $5 per head in 3-, 4-, and 6-packs, finding the EB417 about the same price is a relief. You really DO want to replace heads every few months, after the outer blue bristles fade half-way down."
2425,2481,20100426,B002HWS9GG,4,"April 26, 2010",A1IHQR1NT6CKVR,"Feature-laden, but not perfect","After reading the reviews on Consumer Reports\' web site, I decided to buy the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 with Smart Guide because it received high ratings.The brush is feature-laden (read the product description), but I feel it has a couple of flaws.1) The Power button and the Mode button, used to switch brushing modes, are too close together. I find myself wrapping my thumb around the handle to hold it while brushing and, sometimes inadvertently, hitting the Mode button. So, I\'ll be brushing in one mode and then the brush will switch to a different mode -- this makes me have to hit the Mode button 3-4 times to cycle back through to the mode I want to use. Again, this is my fault, but I also blame it on the design of the brush.2) I find the brush head bristles to be way too hard/harsh. I have these brush heads: Floss Action, Precision Clean and Pro White. I am going to buy the so-called Sensitive brush head and give it a try. If you have sensitive teeth/gums, like I do, then you may want to reconsider buying this brush or make sure you buy the Sensitive brush heads from the start.Other than these two \'flaws\', this is an awesome brush!"

518,529,20100315,B0002KHU3I,5,"March 15, 2010",A3E98U3CVMS8NX,Love these toothbrush heads!,"These are the only heads I will use for my toothbrush. My teeth always feel clean and polished after every use! Sometimes I get a little obsessive and brush harder than necessary, which can make the gumline a little sore, but it\'s of no fault of the brush or the replacement heads.  I am a small person with a small mouth, and the size is just fine for me. My husband also has the same brush, and he loves the double heads just as much!"

2405,2461,20100801,B002HWS9GG,5,"August 1, 2010",A17M65VNB2W7JY,"Excellent brush, great value, gargantuan plug","The SmartSeries 5000 is an excellent product and quite a value as priced here when compared to big-box retailers. I recently upgraded from a very old Oral-B electric brush and am quite pleased with the extended features of this new top-line model. I considered switching to a sonic type system but was dismayed at the variety of brush heads that are not interchangeable among the leading brand\'s models. Oral-B brushes are backward and forward compatible between models which means all the spare heads I had on hand work perfectly well with the new 5000. Anyway, it works very well in all modes and I like the ability to keep four different type brushes on the stand. The visual cues, timers and cleaning modes are very handy. The only drawback to this unit is the grotesquely large charger plug which measures 3.5\' long (excluding the prongs!). Seriously? What designer/engineer thought that was a good idea? There must be a way to achieve a charge without a such a titanic plug, like building the charging guts into the stand for example. I resorted to buying a low-profile 3\' extension cord and hiding the mondo-plug behind a countertop tissue box holder."
2907,2987,20111107,B003UKM90Q,1,"November 7, 2011",A3CAQGL5HSBXV1,Absolutely revolting mold growth,"I\'d been using this toothbrush for a few months when one day I spat into the sink and noticed several black dots. I examined every part of the toothbrush to see where it could have come from, and eventually rinsed out this tiny little hole towards the top of the toothbrush (which I had never noticed or thought about before) and found, to my horror, that it was absolutely filled with disgusting mold. You know those scenes in lowbrow comedies where a character finds out that they\'ve eaten something disgusting, and desperately try to clean out their mouth until they feel better? Yeah, the scene that followed was kind of like that.Maybe I missed something in the instructional booklet (and I DID read it,) but I had no idea I should be on the look-out for mold in such a random place in my toothbrush. A Google search has shown me that a lot of people have the same problem, and they fix it using things like bleach, hotel towels (\'Because it\'s too revolting to even use my own towels on it\') and an independently-created product that attempts to seal the stupid little hole.Personally, I\'m not going to use a hygiene product that can cause way more harm than good. I\'m going to give Oral-B the benefit of the doubt by being open to the idea that MAYBE this problem is avoidable with most electric toothbrush designs, but I still think it\'s really irresponsible to not at least include a note in the packaging that explains proper cleaning procedures."
183,187,20091225,B00006ANDQ,1,"December 25, 2009",AVX6U079FJTNI,This must be a generic version...,"Usually the price of the replacement brushes are much more expensive at the store. This deal (on-line) was too good to be true.  I\'m already on my second brush head within one week.  The small hole below the brush head pinches my lip everytime it makes contact with it and the attachement doesn\'t stay connected to the toothbrush.  Furthermore, the first brush head that I used only last around 4 days.  It literally broke up into little pieces in my mouth. Buy them at the store..."

1710,1754,20100329,B001FWXT8W,4,"March 29, 2010",A1AWENIZKXLBGM,an off label use,"I bought these for my dog. He\'s a schipperke, and they fit his mouth pretty well, and they are nice and soft. I like them better than the toothbrushes they sell for dogs, and they are a better quality for the cost.  The grip on a toothbrush for this purpose is kind of important, as you might imagine; these are easy to hold and manipulate. I think they\'d be good for little hands."
2589,2649,20101009,B003UKKH6O,3,"October 9, 2010",A3DZFEICHK5LF2,"Good value, but like using an old generation","This product is a good value for the money.  This review may sound critical, but its not.The bottom line:  this product simply costs less than many other products, and yet it gets the job done.  If you can\'t afford to pay 2x or 3x for aIts got a timer, which does not beep when you are supposed to change part of your mouth.Its in a blister package, which is cheaper to make than a color box.Its rechargableits waterproofIts also mechanical and noisy.After using it for a prolonged time, I think it does an adequate job.  You don\'t need to spend more money, particularly if you floss.I think this would be the perfect toothbrush for a person who was considering upgrading to a electric but couldn\'t get a sonicare for whatever reason (and there are some good reasons: tooth sensitivity, price, etc)"
1075,1100,20081022,B000AUIFCA,5,"October 22, 2008",A3F1U9KK2LGGPA,Oral B Floss Action Brush Head,"These are the best brush heads for Oral B brushes.  They are 3 times as expensive as non-flossing heads.  They do a better job of cleaning for me, penetrating deeper into the teeth gaps and gum layer.  I use the other brush heads too because I am not sure whether these create gum wear.  I still floss, as these brush heads are not a real substitute.  When I use these flossing brush heads I feel more comfortable flossing just the deep areas between my teeth.  This means I\'m hacking at my gums less with floss, but feel just as clean.  I recommend these replacement brush heads a a mix of brush heads for any Oral B handsets."

There hasn\'t been any significant difference. The Oral B Pulsonic is great.First, I like that it is slim and light. Feels like an actual toothbrush.Second, I like the charging stand--you can mount it on the wall and it holds the toothbrush snugly.Third, I can get my teeth just as clean with this $50 product as I could with the $200 Sonicare.I\'m very satisfied with it."

200,204,20091117,B00006ANDQ,1,"November 17, 2009",A3NPWOKWTXSHDP,DOESN\'T FIT THE ORAL-B EXACTLY RIGHT,"Braun must have changed manufacturers or something.  Amazon claims that \'The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\'  But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush. The toothbrush does work, however. I have two identical Oral-B 3D excel toothbrushes purchased on 8/20/01.  To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  I run the battery down to zero on the one I\'m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it\'s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle itself.Some reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that\'s hard to imagine:  there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  It\'s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it. It\'s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better."

While deep cleaning mode is preferred, this toothbrush has 4 other modes for polishing, whitening, massaging the gums, and a sensitive mode.  I love the way my teeth feel after using it. It comes with a \'Smart guide\' that shows where you are supposed to place the toothbrush and for how long, before moving on to another quadrant in your mouth.  It signals the change to the next quadrant by making a noise, and it shows on the Smart Guide as well.  After the 2 minutes are up, it displays a smiley face and if you go beyond the 2 minutes, it winks at you.

The 2 minute timer makes it easy to brush the proper amount of time and since I\'ve been using these my Dentist has complimented me on how well I maintain my teeth. I like this style because you can use regular AA batteries or rechargable AA batteries (which is what I use). The charge usually lasts more than a month.

I\'m still not sure how the timer works, either. My only other complaint is that I wish there were a light or something to indicate that the toothbrush is charging. There\'s not.Although the package claims that the toothbrush cleans between teeth, you\'ll definitely still need to floss. I flossed after brushing, and I would say that there was less crud between my teeth than when I use a regular toothbrush, but there was still some (especially the back teeth; there was hardly any in my front teeth).I would definitely recommend this toothbrush, as long as you\'re OK with its intensity.

Amazon\'s description for this product says that it comes with three brush heads: \'Pro White(tm) Brush Head with polishing cup: Whitens teeth by removing surface stains,  Oral-B FlossAction� Brush Head: Offers outstanding interdental cleaning, and Oral-B Sensitive Brush Head: Is gentle on teeth and gums.\'  There are only two brush heads in the package.  No big deal, right?  Well, then, why not get the description right?  I am disturbed by false advertising, even at the level of how many brush heads are included; makes me wonder what else is wrong in the description.2. The door to the battery compartment on the SmartSense unit is very hard to remove.  It slides about an eighth of an inch and then you have to pick it off.  That is very unclear and the manual does not give directions on how to remove it without breaking it.  If you have any problems with your fingers, you may not be able to get it open since it requires a lot of force to move the back that one eighth of an inch.  That is a problem, especially since the SmartSense unit is one of the reasons this unit is so expensive.  I went to the Oral-B website to find a solution for this problem and there was none.  The website is purely a marketing site.This product is advertised with great features, and others have given it good reviews.  It had better be great or this is one customer who will take advantage of the 60-day money back guarantee."

The lower \'sensitive\' speed does not tickle the gums, and the pick like brush allows me to carefully brush the gum line and the crevices between teeth.

The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  There are no recesses to collect toothpaste, moisture etc., so it is easy to keep clean.  I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...my whole mouth.  It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone. I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \'between\' brush would be a good thing to use. The only change I would make would be to slant the head a bit to enable reaching inside surfaces.  All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...in fact it is still working. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the Sonicare, but for the money, this is the best buy. After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  AND, I do not work for Oral B.  Come on...get real paranoid people...09/10/09:  I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  I have not had this problem.  I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed and I can see where that might create the above mentioned problem.  I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  Just food for thought if trying to decide on this product.  I still love it."

While the packaging looks OEM, the quality of these heads is vastly inferior to ones purchased off the shelf at Target/CVS/etc.  The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  I\'ve used Oral-B electric brushes for over 10 years, and these heads behaved very differently.  After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!) during operation.  Also, I noticed that the \'blue indicator bristles\' never changed color at all after 8-12 weeks of use.  I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  I have noted other reviews echo these same problems.My opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...I am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product."

My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual so it\'s not that important to me.  I am still amazed at the length of the charge, we can go a week with two people using it twice daily.  The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  I have found some info about defective and/or counterfit heads.

It does the same job as the more expensive version and is easier to hold. It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it. Because it is lighter and thinner, I think I actually use it longer. It is also easier to find the replacement heads for it. I also think that the shape of the toothbrush makes it is easier to get at the back of the bottom teeth where the plaque is the worst. That means less time in the hygenist chair.

Batteries last 3-5 years (meaning 3 years), AND once the battery is exhausted and no longer holds a charge, you have to throw away the entire unit.The company\'s explanation is that the unit is water tight so removing the battery breaks that seal. This is horrific design flaw - if they wanted they could allow for battery replacement.BUT...allowing battery replacement means you wouldn\'t have to BUY AN ENTIRE NEW UNIT.So...essentially the consumer is being held hostage to a company that\'s designed a product that has to be thrown away.LASTLY...there is no easy means of recycling. I was told I had to go to a Braun service center. On Long Island. 30+ miles away. That\'s irresponsible. A company should stand behind their product; offer, at the very least, a reasonable outlet to recycle something.

It is by far the best toothbrush we have ever used and have no complaints! Thanks you so much for such a wonderful product!"

I tried two of the six. Each felt a little odd at first and after less than a week of use the head of each became loose and the rotating action stopped working. I received six toothbrushes as advertised, but they were not in the retail packaging shown. Instead, they were individually packaged with only Oral-B stenciled on the packaging. I don\'t know whether these were counterfeit or factory seconds, but they were clearly defective. Please note that I have been using this same type of toothbrush head on my Oral B electric toothbrush for at least 2 years without ever having a problem. And when the ones I purchased at Amazon failed, I went to Walmart and bought a replacement, and it works fine. Because I didn\'t start using the toothbrushes until about 3 months after purchase, the seller refused to accept a return or to refund my money. I believe the seller goes by different names, including Potential Dynamix LLC, DAB Unlimited, and DAB Nutrition. I can\'t even leave seller feedback on Amazon because it\'s been more than 90 day. But clearly this is a seller to avoid."

Why it took so long for me to buy an electric or battery powered toothbrush is beyond me. However, I\'m glad I finally woke-up and bought this \'Oral-B Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\', I\'ll never buy another manual toothbrush again.It\'s a Great Toothbrush. Buy it, you won\'t regret it.It comes as advertized with two AA batteries, just plug them in and you\'re ready to go. It has a neat 2 minute timer, which by the way is a long time when you actually start brushing. And that\'s a good thing.I got one tiny, insignificant gripe, it\'s hard to see the (+ -) battery polarity on the side of the toothbrush after removing the battery cap. When I installed the batteries the first time it wouldn\'t start, so I had to switch the batteries around, and now I have to remember the correct installation the next time I add new batteries. It\'s nothing to lose sleep over.Speaking of battery caps, removing the batter cap may be a slight problem for those people who suffer arthritis of the hand but it\'s do-able. You have to \'squeeze hard\' the two rubber spots on the sides, at the bottom of the toothbrush to release the battery cap. With that said, that too can be a good thing, because that means the battery compartment is airtight and waterproof.The ON/OFF switch is covered in some type of rubbery, waterproof membrane and is very responsive; quick on, quick off. The brush itself has a nice weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. Has the right amount of balance as well.The handle is made of two types of materials: rubber and a very smooth plastic, there\'s enough rubber on the handle so you don\'t have to worry about it slipping from your hands, even when wet. The package doesn\'t mention anything about what type of bristle comes with this toothbrush (i.e., soft or hard bristle), however, I felt NO irritation or discomfort what-so-ever.The overall length is 8-inches; brush head length is about 2.75-inches, width of the handle is about 1.5-inches X 1-inches.There are four different styles of toothbrush refill heads available for the \'Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Clean\':1)Oral-B \'Precision\' Clean Brush Head (which comes with this toothbrush)2)Oral-B \'Pro White\' Replacement Brush Head3)Oral-B \'Dual Action\' Premium Power Toothbrush Head4)Oral B \'Floss Action\' Brush HeadI plan on stocking up on all 4 refills. I have all 32 of my teeth and I plan on keeping all 32 teeth, for as long as I can. And this battery powered toothbrush will definitely help me do that."

I replaced it with a more expensive model, but it has served me well. I\'m happy with my purchase as this low price. The brush head rotates back and forth. More expensive rechargeable models will have much more power so they will brush much more efficiently in the same amount of time and they also vibrate. If you are on a budget, you can buy this one, otherwise look at the oral-b professional 1000 (all the models are the same except for extras you don\'t need)."
53,54,20050814,B00006ANDJ,5,"August 14, 2005",AS627L9YJHE1P,"An easy, safe, effective way to brush","Dentists all over the country are recommending the Oral-B electric toothbrush. There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  This particular item is three heads.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads.  You can find them for much less than $10/head, which is the price of this listing."

My hygieneist recommended the Oral B a while back and I took her advice.why I like my Oral B better:1- The heads are small and round like the dentist\'s equipment. It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than \'brushing\' like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).2- It\'s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.3- If it pops out of your mouth while it\'s running, it doesn\'t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.4- It doesn\'t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever? I was told my gums are in much better shape than before.6- It\'s cheaper.  \'nough said."

I\'ve grown to trust Oral-B since splurging on my own.There are definite differences. My more expensive model seems much more powerful (rightfully so) and also seems to have more \'rotation\' BUT DOES this less expensive model CLEAN TEETH and GUMS WELL? YES.Bottom line I guess is does it get the job done. It works. It certainly feels better than regular ole toothbrushes. It feels like the rotating head is really getting into the gumline.What\'s really nice is that this toothbrush and my other Oral-B both accept the same replaceable brush heads which is great since they usually come in packs of more than one.I recommend this product.

Because of this I\'ve used the old fashioned manual brushes that did a reasonable job of keeping my teeth clean. Well, this tradition is about to change.After using this brush, my teeth have a smooth and polished feel all the way down to just below the gum line! Amazing! Even my manual brushes don\'t do as thorough a job. Also, the brush charges through induction which means that it\'s waterproof and has no wires or metal contact points that need to be protected from water. This is very cool.I could only find one minor downside to this brush which is that the head is somewhat thick. What I mean is that the distance between the bristle tips and back of the head makes it necessary for me to open my mouth fairly wide  to get the brush the tops of my rear molars. This isn\'t a challenge for me but it might be for someone with a smaller mouth.I guess I can summarize my review by saying that I\'m tossing out my manual brushes because this is now my personal favorite.

Put some toothpaste on and press the button. Oh, and put it in your mouth first, or risk some dramatic toothpaste flingage.The brush will operate for two minutes, \'stutter\' a bit to let you know the time is up, and then keep operating until you turn it off. No worries about being partway through a complex brushing maneuver when your two minutes are over.As for the brushing, IT IS INTENSE.  Seriously, my whole head vibrates, and my teeth are super clean. Only hygienists with scrapey tools do a more thorough job. And with this thing, maybe they won\'t have much work to do next time I visit them.Everyone should use one of these."

To be honest, I think that the Sonicare feels better on my gums and also I think it does a better job overall.  HOWEVER, I hate my sonicare because of the way it grows mold.

Unless you actually unscrew the head and wash it out every day, and leave it taken apart to dry out, you will get mold inside your sonicare - and once that happens the brush pretty much smells like mold for the duration of its life (there may even be mold inside of the handle itself which I just cannot see without breaking it).This is not the case for the Oral-b Vitality.  The vitality features a snap-on type head which has no cracks to allow water to seep through.  The new sonicare features a flexible head, which I believe creates the problem with the mold (the old sonicares did not flex nor did they have the same mold problem).  The Viatlity head does not flex, it\'s just a straight snap-on piece with a rotating brush head at the top.Another thing I like about the Vitality is that it has changeable heads.  There are different heads which you can attach for different uses: Floss-Action, Pro White, and Dual Clean heads.  I use the Floss-Action and Pro White attachments - 2 minutes for each attachment.  The Floss action feels somewhat similar to a normal brush and gets all the stuff off your teeth, but the Pro-White has a weird yellow rubber thing in the middle of the bristles which rubs up against your teeth and whitens/polishes them.The Vitality also beats the sonicare in that it\'s brush heads come in packs of 3 for $20, whereas the sonicare offers packs of 2 for $20 (however, I believe the sonicare claims it lasts for 6 months and the vitality for 3).BATTERIES - the sonicare lasted about a month on a single charge - the Vitality only lasts about 2 weeks.That is all I can think of to put in this review.  The only reason I gave this brush 4 stars instead of five is because I wish it had more of a Sonicare vibration action - however it has an interesting rotating action which takes some getting used to.  The Vitality just doesn\'t feel like it cleans the gumline as well as the sonicare did - but at the same time it feels like it cleans the surface of the teeth better than the sonicare."

They are totally inferior to the real thing available at 3 for $21.00 in American drug stores.  The brushing heads quickly become loose and the body slips on the metal shaft of the toothbrush base. Pinching lips is another wonderful feature.  Some prices are too good to be true.  This fake item is nowhere near the quality of real replacement heads available to you locally.  Avoid this rip-off.

I opted for the 3000 as it seemed to offer the best balance between features and price. Something else worth considering: I\'m trying to not line China\'s pockets any more than necessary, and the Oral-B is made in Germany by Braun. I doubt there\'s a US-made alternative.I\'ve found the unit super easy to use and clean, and my teeth feel incredibly clean.

The plastic bristles aren\'t very flexible so they don\'t really get around a tooth; the texture is different, too -- like it should be squeaking in protest.

2858,2934,20100826,B003UKM90Q,4,"August 26, 2010",ALXFN5BF1H691,Not bad for a cheap rotating brush,"I\'ve used one of Oral-B\'s more upscale models for a while (the 8900 DLX), so I was curious how the value models would do. And it\'s really not too bad for $30.First, you have to realize that if you\'re moving from a normal brush you have to re-learn how to brush. No more moving the brush rapidly with your hand - press the button on the handle and it starts whirling at high speed. Press the brush to your teeth and gums and sloooowly move it left to right or right to left. Make sure you get all three sides of top and bottom, and that you get the gumlines - that\'s the most important part. Obviously it doesn\'t really matter what order you do it in, but if I don\'t keep a pattern I get distracted by pets or people and forget. After two minutes the brush will briefly stop the motor a few times to let you know you\'ve brushed enough - next time you can adjust your movement speed to hit that mark.It includes an induction charger - just set the handle on it. You can do it every night or once a week.So how does this $30 model compare to the $90-120 models? Well, the grip is noticably cheaper, with no rubber grip stripes. The induction charger is very easy to tip over compared to the sturdier \'well\' model. There\'s no charge indicator. The whole thing feels a little bit more flimsy than the 8900, though it never felt like it would actually come apart. There\'s no 30 second indicator like the better models, and there\'s only one speed, though I never found the other speeds on the 8900 useful anyhow.All in all not bad for $30 - of course they\'ll get you for $3-4 each for replacement head, but that\'s only every 3 months or so, and this comes with one head and one spare head. And I think you\'ll do a better job with this than with a regular brush - it\'s very easy to pay for itself if you just get one fewer cavity. If you want one of the above features spring for a better model, but this isn\'t bad for 1/3rd the cost."
2269,2321,20101124,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 24, 2010",AERARMG71WXQB,Extremely Pleased with my purchase of the Oral-B Pro 5000,"I have owned one other rechargable toothbrush in my life and that was a Water Pic about 25 years ago when I was 35. It was nothing to write home about and was very basic compared to what is available these days. Once the battery went dead, I just went back to a manual toothbrush. I decided after my dentist appointment that my wife and I went to a couple weeks ago and having to pay $70(times 2) out of pocket as my copay for a deep cleaning for each of us to remove build up under the gums that I would see what was available in a rechargeable. It was a toss up as my dentist recommended both Oral-B, but only carried SonicCare with a $15 rebate at the front counter for sale. While at the Dentist office, I did enter a drawing for their top of the line SonicCare FlexCare Plus with Sanitizer by donating some can food for a local food bank for Thanksgiving. I am the type of guy that if I brought 999 cans and had a 999 out a thousand chance would not win in a drawing. I went home....researched both brands....read tons of reviews and checked the pricing on Amazon. The Oral-B reviews were consistly higher and the price with the 50% rebate on this model made it a hands down easier decision. This professional care toothbrush normally $159.99 retail was on Amazon last Wednesday for $104.99. I purchased 2 sets. They arrived at my door yesterday, with the free shipping and no sales tax. I was impressed when I opened them as to all that was included. My mindset was ....wow....only $50 for all this per set after rebate. It comes with at nice durable blue travel case that houses the toothbrush, and 2 brush heads. A nice travel charger that is multi-voltage and will work in other countries such as UK or Australia. It even came with an extra set of duracell batteries for the remote control clock/timer. I thought that was a nice touch that they would include those. The rechargable toothbrushes were both battery dead, so I set one up in each bathroom, and let them charge overnight to full charge. I used mine first thing this morning and was pleasantly surprised as to how easy and proficient it was brushing...I mean.... 30000 brush stokes per minute is 500 per second and I know I was never doing that manually. It comes with two different styled toothbrushes...one round and one flossing type. The flossing type is my favorite as it actually is flossing while brushing, so it is a 2 in 1 brush. Your teeth will feel like you just had them professionally cleaned at the dentist office. That nice squeaky sound when you touch your teeth with your finger. The toothbrush has like 5 settings for brushing from Sensitive to Deep Clean. The default setting worked perfectly for my teeth and gums. The little handy remote control timer......sits to the side and not only gives you the time of day, but when you turn on the toothbrush it automatically starts a 2 minute timer or 3 minute depending on how you set it up and times you on a 2 minute timer to 30 seconds per quadrant and lets you know when to move to the next set of teeth in the next quadrant and gives you a smiley face when you are done.  Funny, as I was typing this review I got a phone call from my dentist telling me that I won the raffle for the $189.99 Sonic FlexCare+ with sanitizer and that I could come pick it up. While I have never won anything before I am more hyped up on the Oral B and will likely just sell the SonicCare FlexCare+ on Craigslist for more than I paid for both of my Oral B\'s together. I apologize if this was too wordy. I am not a professional writer and I base what I buy off of what others write and just did not want to miss anything."

I\'ve gone through a lot of batteries on the Crest brush.* Variety of replaceable heads - currently using the Vitality Floss Action but like the availability of other styles* 2-minute timer - automatically tells you after 2 minutes of brushing, great way to build that habit* Good speed, not too fast or slow, just feels right* Mouth feels cleaner after this brush than with my previous spinbrushThe Not-so-good:* No indicator for battery life - It is designed with the expectation that most people will leave it plugged in all the time, but I prefer to run my batteries down between charges and I didn\'t get much warning when it quit in the middle of a brush one night.Other than that, I love this brush.

The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days.  3 days is the new norm. That\'s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger.  It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference.  After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it\'s smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."

I was so excited to receive it and tried it right way. It is slim and light weight but it was not nearly as powerful as the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush which I am currently using. It vibrates right on your hand and makes your hand tremble and it gets slippery when it gets wet while you brushing your teeth.  As compact toothbrush for travel, it didn\'t come with a world voltage charger. And the charger that comes with it is heavier and bulkier than toothbrush itself.So don\'t get misled by all the rave reviews, save your money and wait for better one to come out or go buy one try it out yourself."

Funny, that first one took some getting used to because it seemed to vibrate to the point of feeling like you were being tickled. Yet, this new Oral B vibrates much more, but completely lacks this sensation. Definitely feels like a much more intense brushing than the prior generation of Oral Bs (had the circular one and the one with the split head).The setup is nice too: the charger is a bit better than the prior ones and there is a flossing tip that is useful.

It has a long-lasting rechargeable battery, which charges whenever not in use, and does a great job on teeth with a head that is shaped for hard-to-reach areas.  But the best part of this brush is the little timer that has some kind of remote signal.  It is a clock when not in use (and gives the correct time) then becomes a timer when you start to brush.  I can walk out of the room, even, and it continues to time me.  Dentists recommend brushing at least two minutes - and you get a little smiley face when you hit two minutes, or a big smiley face (sometimes a wink) if you brush for 2:30.  My kids want one ot these now, too, but I\'d say it\'s a bit too powerful for kids.  It\'s a great buy and, while it costs way more than a standard toothbrush, it holds up beautifully and works hard.  It also comes with a carrying case for travel, which I love because power toothbrushes never fit into standard cases.  The battery charge lasts two days off the charger, so you can go away for the weekend without carrying all the gear. Love it."

It took some getting used to but after I did I felt it was doing a good job. I recently tried the Oral-b Dual Clean and found it to be a very old school design.  The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  If I only had the choice between this and a manual toothbrush I would choose the manual brush.  I\'m sure it does an okay job and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  I also suggest considering sonic brushes that do not have rotating parts, I think after you get used to them they leave your mouth feeling cleaner."
2666,2734,20100831,B003UKKHB4,5,"August 31, 2010",AQM0K7MBBT4AY,"UPDATED: Amazing, amazing toothbrush.","&lt;&lt;UPDATE: I\'ve been using this toothbrush for a month or so, and recently realized... my teeth have ACTUALLY GOTTEN NOTICEABLY WHITER. The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush. I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well. Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH. I stand by this toothbrush as a high-quality product. It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.>>I have 5 dental implants, so taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.At a recent visit to my dentist I was told I had receeding gums around one of my implants. The problem? Part of it was that the implant crown wasn\'t seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard. The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.I went to Target and bought their generic \'Up & Up\' brand electric toothbrush. This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums. However, when the Oral-b 3000 came out on Amazon Vine, I knew I had to order & review it.The Oral-b 3000 does NOT disappoint. For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic \'Up & Up\' model I was using before. Second, it actually lights up when you\'re brushing too hard. I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I\'m distracted and in a hurry to get to work. It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.Another nice feature is the \'timer\' function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits. This is also nice, as many of us tend to hurry through our brushing routine. The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom. The brush unit\'s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn\'t notice a decrease in power. This is a nice contrast with my Up & Up toothbrush which, though it claims it\'ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.I\'ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far. My old unit is in storage and probably won\'t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas. I haven\'t made use of the different brushing modes, but I\'m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth, will appreciate these.All in all the brush unit, brush head, and charger included in this package are all great and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than, the competing brands/brushes. The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth & gums, the unit pays for itself handily. I recommend!"

It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on. Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth. Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode. Returning two of these and will probably go back to Sonicare for next purchase."

The original must have lasted at least 10 years, but the replacement doesn\'t look like it will hold up as well.

If you understand the advantages and disadvantages and know what you\'re getting, this seems a fine reusable filter.  Be advised that if you have a Braun coffee maker you might need the Braun brand replacement filter as some off-brand replacement filters don\'t have the \'notches\' in the rim of the filter that you would need to fit some Braun coffee makers.The description of the product on the Amazon page that I ordered the filter from is wrong.

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is currently for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $9.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are 3 of them).  There are other offers through Amazon for this exact same item for up to $19.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!

My husband also got the same brush, just not with the SmartGuide. He doesn\'t mind that he doesn\'t have one (the Oral-B rep told us over the phone that the model just below this one would still be compatible with the SmartGuide but it isn\'t) but admits that it would be nice. My mouth feels so nice after I brush. I actually used a regular toothbrush the other day after using my Oral-B for a few weeks because I just needed to brush for 30 seconds and run. It felt so...crappy! I was shocked how useless the brush felt in my mouth, like it was doing nothing. Anyway, needless to say, I\'ll never go back to a regular brush."

Plus with the mail in rebate going on, its a great buy."

2999,3082,20100831,B003UKR67M,4,"August 31, 2010",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,Cost-effective and suitable replacement for manual toothbrush,"This Oral-B is a cost-effective and suitable replacement for a manual toothbrush, and is a good bet for anyone looking to get a cheap automatic toothbrush.First, the exterior design.  The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  The brush itself is cordless, although the cord on the base station would be better served if it were retractable, for space management purposes.  Oral-B claims that the rechargeable battery cannot be \'killed\' by repeated charging, so hopefully that works as advertised.  The package also comes with one replacement head, which is a value-added touch.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.Second, effectiveness.  It\'s equipped with a 2 minute timer, which indicates the suggested total brushing length.  This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner after usage, although not quite on par with visiting a dentist\'s office.  The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.The review merits the deduction of one star, due to head design.  If the head were skinnier and angled, then it could enable better access to teeth in the rear of my mouth. Overall, a very good, entry-level toothbrush from Oral-B."

Glide Deep Clean is wonderfully smooth and comfortable, making flossing downright pleasant on both your gums and your fingers. The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you\'ve cleaned.But... It\'s the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest\'s claims of being \'shred resistant\' fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven\'t yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can\'t even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn\'t inspire confidence. At the price premium Crest is demanding, I\'d expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece."

My mother spent a lot of money on me as a child; she paid for me to have braces two different times. I always want to have good teeth for aesthetic reasons, and also because my mom invested so much in my teeth even though paying for braces twice wasn\'t so easy for her. I figure it\'s the least I can do, considering what she did for me.I have been wanting a rechargeable toothbrush for a long time, and I wanted the best I could buy in the Oral B line. I kind of thought that $100 was pretty high for a toothbrush, but they are offering the 50% rebate right now. When I get the rebate check, I\'ll really only have $50 in it. And that\'s not a bad price for a product that helps you keep your mouth healthier. I would have eventually bought this toothbrush at full price without a rebate, but the 50% rebate really pushed me to go ahead and buy it now.I got my toothbrush about 4 days ago, and I absolutely love it so far. I feel like it does a much better job than a manual toothbrush ever could. I\'ve been brushing in the Deep Clean mode, which is 3 minutes. Sometimes I even continue brushing for a minute or two after the 3 minutes on the Smart Guide has passed. My teeth feel so smooth when I\'m finished brushing; it\'s amazing.I love the Smart Guide that comes with this toothbrush. The timer really helps you see how long to brush in each quadrant before moving on to the next. I feel like I\'m getting a professional cleaning at home.I read a lot of reviews on here before making my purchase, which was very helpful. I did read a few reviews where people had said they experienced some bleeding from their gums, but I haven\'t had any trouble with that at all.So far, I\'m thrilled with this toothbrush and hope it continues to impress me. My twice yearly dental cleanings/checkups are always great, but I\'m really anxious for my next visit to see if the hygienist notices less plaque buildup, etc.If you\'re thinking about a rechargeable toothbrush, this is an excellent choice. The rebate right now can\'t be beat either!"

It is rechargable, and the charge last well over a week. It comes with two heads, and you can use both, or share the other one with someone else.

Tastes better without the slight overtone of cardboard you get with paper filters, and it is MUCH cheaper to use.  On the down side:  your coffee isn\'t good \'to the last drop\' - sediment does accumulate, so you have to discipline yourself to drink only down to the sediment.  Otherwise, you will have a mouthful of nasty glop."
