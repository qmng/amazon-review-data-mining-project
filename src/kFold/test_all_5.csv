It had 5 blades, a surrounding cushion, a grippy handle, and it shaves beautifully.  I can\'t complain.  However, I\'ve been using a Venus for several years -- one with 3 blades -- and *it* shaves beautifully too.  The last time I shaved, I used both razors, one at a time of course, to see which performed better.  I really saw/felt no difference between the two.  The Embrace\'s 5 blades are smaller in width than the other razor\'s 3 blades.  The head of the Embrace is larger, supposedly to offer more cushioning.  But the difference between the two razors\' ability to shave really isn\'t noticable!  They both did a fine job!  So if you have an older-style Venus, you might as well keep using it.  No need to upgrade if you like the razor you already have.  And for those of you who haven\'t tried Venus razors, they allow you to give your legs safe, smooth shave.  I would recommend this product if you don\'t already have a razor you like.Edit: After several months of use, I can warn you... never leave this razor face-down on any surface (countertop, edge of bathtub, etc.)  The material surrounding the blade will stick to that surface and, when you try to pick up the razor, the material will rip like paper and leave a residue on the countertop or wherever (it can be removed, but it\'s sort of annoying.)  Be sure to make use of your razor holder!    "

4780,1607,1649,20080828,B001CX4JSS,3,"August 28, 2008",A1VUN4JU731CBH,Not sure...,"I have pretty much had and tested them all: The Oral-B Triumph, the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, and now the Oral-B Pulsonic. Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but the Pulsonic leaves me a bit unsure.The design of this brush is very reminiscent of the Sonicare toothbrushes, right down to the stand which always looked different on all the previous Oral-B electric brushes. This design really looks like a stripped-down baby version of the Sonicare.First of, the brush itself is extremely slim and light-weight for an electric brush. So much so that one wonders whether it can actually \'do the job\'. So after charging it the required 12 hours, I tried it out for the first time. I did not find it any different in power than the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, it felt the same.What is different is that the Pulsonic\'s manual instructs the user to move the brush over the teeth in a circular motion, very much like one is supposed to do with a manual brush. I, for one, didn\'t quite like this although I can see the benefit of doing it this way. The Pulsonic has - like the Sonicare and unlike the Oral-B Triumph - a regular (yet contoured) brush head. The shape of such a brush head makes it difficult  to sufficiently cover the entire tooth. One is always either cleaning along the gumline or more towards the bite. Using circular motion prevents that only parts of the teeth are cleaned. Yet - I have been using electric toothbrushes for so long that I have gotten used to not really having to do anything but hold the brush head to the teeth. So this is a change I am not sure I like too much.Also - these rectangular brush heads don\'t seem to work too well for me personally. I have a small mouth and find it difficult to easily brush my teeth with these brush heads, especially the insides of the front teeth. It always feels as if I can\'t quite reach all the surfaces, especially the areas along the gumline, and that leaves me wondering whether I get as complete a cleaning as I should be getting.Philips has tried to address this problem by offering a smaller brush head for the Sonicare, but Oral-B doesn\'t seem to have that. So this is not optimal for me.What I did like about the Pulsonic though is that it comes with a second \'Precision Tip\' brush head. I found this to be a great way to really get into the spaces between teeth and I give Oral-B a big thumbs-up for this one.Lastly, the Pulsonic, like the other models and brands, informs the user audibly when it is time to change to a different \'quadrant\' to be brushed, and when the two minutes recommended brush time are over.All in all this is probably a brush I will take along when travelling - the light weight but equal power output make it perfect for that, but at home I will likely stay with the Oral-B Triumph and its round brush heads. I just feel that these heads reach all areas of my teeth better and also feel more comfortable on the sensitive areas of my mouth."

My usual go-to-razor is a 3-blade store brand, which works just as good as the old Gillette Sensor. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the close shave from the Fusion Proglide. I still feel the additional blades (over 3) does not contribute to the closer shave. It is a result of the tension strip that stretches your skin as you shave. Although it is a great shave, I don\'t think the additional costs (or blades) justify the extra expense versus a standard 3-blade razor.    "

6469,233,237,20100608,B003JA3KDW,4,"June 8, 2010",A1VYFEJM12ZP11,An expensive feeling conditioner.,"We all know the difference between how a cheap conditioner feels and how an expensive one feels as you apply it in the shower.  The more expensive brands leave your hair feeling softer and less tangle-y than the cheaper versions do, and this conditioner definitely feels nice on the hair and leaves it very soft and manageable.I have curly hair so I thought I would give this one a try.  It\'s a good conditioner, but is it any better for my hair than say any other Pantene conditioner on the market?  I\'d have to say no.  I can\'t tell the difference between using this formulation or the regular Pantene.  My hair still requires me to put anti-frizz products in it, and it doesn\'t look any different after using this conditioner than another kind quite honestly.But that aside, the reason to buy this particular product is that this DOES leave hair soft and able to be combed right out of the shower (unlike some cheap conditioners) so that is why I give it 4 stars.  I don\'t believe there is any conditioner on the market currently that can truly manage the frizz of curly hair, and probably there never will be.  You will always have to follow your same routine and use additional product after your shower if you need to control the frizz inherent in curly hair. "

Before I tried the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count), I thought I had clean teeth. Clearly, I was wrong. I have been using the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) for about a month now and the difference is unbelievable! It\'s like instead of taking a quick dip in a community swimming pool, my teeth are being treated to a luxury bath with bubbles and a massage, EVERY DAY! Sometimes even twice a day. If the effects of the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) stopped there, I would be merely satisfied, but as you may pick up from my tone and use of exclamation points, I am ecstatic! I used to go on dates with the confidence of a nerdy insecure loser; picture Woody Allen, but with bigger glasses. Now I have the confidence to take on anything! It\'s like I\'m Rambo but not a psychopath and with the cleanest teeth EVER. But wait, there\'s more. The other day I was driving down the street and I got pulled over by a cop for speeding. He got out of his car, came up to my window, and asked me for my license and registration. As I gave it to him, I looked up and flashed him one of those Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) clean smiles. It just so happened that he was a user too. He instantly realized, gave me a nod and a wink, and ripped up my ticket. Thanks, Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I did notice a little bit of a difference after the first use, but after continued use of the shampoo (almost through the whole bottle) I hardly see any great changes. I use the hairspray, shampoo, conditioner, heat protectant spray, and volumizing gel. The volumizing gel does make a great difference versus shampoo and conditioner alone. Even though I didn\'t get the results I hoped for from this product, I still use it because Pantene altogether has made my hair stronger and much healthier! Good product, affordable system. "

I have lots of problems with some floss catching on my dental work or shredding between my tight teeth, but the OralB floss picks have a smooth ribbon floss that meets the challenge without any problems.

The bristles initially felt too hard, but it\'s just a matter of getting accustomed to the toothbrush.Although this toothbrush cleans the teeth well I cannot emphasize enough the importance of continuing to floss between the teeth.  The timer that comes with the device is not necesssary as there is a slight change in speed after each 30 seconds of brushing, but I do find it helpful for me.I keep my brush on the charger, but find it works fine without the charger when I\'m out of town over a week. If you keep it plugged in make sure the brush is seated properly or it will overheat. When used in conjunction with the Oral Breeze Quick Breeze (faucet attachment) it makes for a really clean-feeling mouth.

The Mach3 pulled like pliers on my chin hair, but the Pro glided right through.  I think the thinner blades schtick is more than a marketing line.

I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \'made for a woman, not a man.\'  This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.Like the standard (purple) VENUS BREEZE, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR (pale pink) comes with a holder which mounts directly to the wall of your shower or bath.  Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  The three blades are surrounded by gel bars.  There is no need to use shaving cream; just moisten the gel bars to get that silky, satiny feel.  The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme climate.To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  This will help any razor to give you a closer shaver.  While you are soaking, get the cartridge wet, so that the gel gets creamy.  You never want to shave with a dry razor anyway...ouch!  I usually just toss the razor in the tub for a minute or two.  Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  Just one less thing to worry about.The only negative about the VENUS BREEZE is that the gel bars do not last as long as the blades!  With care, the blades in each cartridge last up to a month.  (The triple blades shave my legs so close, that I really only need to shave them every other day.)  But the gel bars either run out or fall off in 2 - 3 weeks.  Then I go back to the shaving cream until the blades give out.Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  I have been satisfied with it for many years.  If Gillette could just make the gel bars last a bit longer...the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.    "

Her hair varies from wavy to loosely curly, depending on how long it is and how it\'s been washed and dried. The long parts tangle very easily, and the short parts curl and spring every which way, so I was hoping this conditioner would help eliminate the tangling while defining and controlling her curls a bit better.This conditioner did do a great job of detangling and smoothing my daughter\'s hair. I was able to comb it easily wet right out of the bath, and, better yet, the tangles stayed away and it remained easy to brush even after she\'d slept on it.

The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  The brushing unit is waterproof so no worry about getting water or moisture on it. There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush. The unit uses a rechargeable battery, which the company claims can not be over charged, so you can store the brushing unit on the electric charger unit.I have used both a Phillips and Oral-B electric toothbrush and find that this rechargeable model does a comparable job in the cleaning of my teeth. I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back teeth.The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth. The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums. The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off. The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.The brushing bristles give an indication by fading in color to show when it should be replaced. I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package. Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long but it looks very similar to the brushing head I have used on my Oral-B electric toothbrush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model."

I have to say though that I\'m quite impressed with how easy it was to use this Gillette Venus razor and how well it worked.There is no need for any shaving cream or gel at all - the moisturizing bars that encase the razor do an excellent job of providing the traction you need once they get wet, they leave a very slick almost gooey path along the surface of your skin as you go along.Overall I found this super-easy to use, I was able to shave my legs in much less time.  The only drawback I found was that I don\'t think I was able to shave quite as close as I normally am able to when using a plain razor and shaving cream.  I found after when running my hands across the surface of my legs when they were dry that they weren\'t quite as smooth, but it was still definitely a very good job and a great time-saver.    "

It gets every speck of plaque off of my teeth, even in the hard to reach areas.  Unlike an old powered toothbrush I once had, it doesn\'t require a special toothpaste, and can use your favorite kind.  Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  I\'m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time. (You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about oral hygiene.)The toothbrush comes with a sealed plastic charger, which will charge the brush overnight.  A full charge will give you a week\'s worth of brushing. (14 x 2 minutes) This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.  You can also store the brush on the charger, but this isn\'t the most ecological way of charging the brush.  It also comes with one refill, and additional refills are available here on Amazon."

My son has a severe peanut allergy, and apparently with allergies comes eczema (skin condition that causes open sores).  We\'ve used steroids with limited results, and we don\'t like using it very much nor does my son as it\'s a pretty strong medicine.For some reason, my memory was triggered and I remembered my Japanese mother growing aloe plants and using them on us when we had an injury or received a burn (happens when you grow up on a farm).  I wasn\'t thinking of prevention, but healing his open sores that were getting pretty bad--on his arms, behind his legs, on his feet, and on his inner thighs.  (He is entering his teenage years, and is obviously very sensitive about his skin.  The kids at school always ask why he wears long pants, and not shorts like they do in school and after school).Long story short, I came across \'George\'s Aloe\' and thought what the heck, can\'t hurt.  It\'s a natural product and worth a try.  I also read that Aloe is a natural antihistimine.  We\'ve been using it for a week on our son, and the results are very positive.  It hasn\'t prevented the outbreaks, but it has diminished them noticeably.  I would say upwards of 80% improvement.  The spring is the worst time for my son, and it\'s been very manageable.  My wife and I have noticed a significant improvement in his condition and he drinks a small glass of George\'s Aloe every morning.  I tried it, and it indeed does take like water.  Read the directions, though, as you don\'t need much.I\'ve since supplemented the \'internal\' treatment with an external treatment of the actual aloe plant rubbed on the outside of his body (arms, legs, feet, etc.).  You basically just cut off a very small part of the leaf, and it\'s a gel inside.  I rub that on his sores, pimples, and hives and paired with the Aloe juice, has had a dramatic effect, a definite improvement for the better.  My son is much more relaxed of late, and very happy with the results.  It\'s not perfect by any means, but he itches a LOT less and he doesn\'t have the open weeping sores that he had before.

What I have learned and was hoping to find info on before purchasing: They come with the applicator stick already in the tube and per instructions you have to pull it out till it clicks and then when inserting push it back in until it clicks. Great idea for making them take up less room and not get ruined in your pocket or purse. They are a little more flimsy then the regular ones so you have to be careful. Also, the first one the stick fell into the toilet. I have been careful with the rest, strategically holding them, but the rest have not really seemed as loose so it might have just been a fluke thing.

It felt kind of crazy to spend $100+ on a toothbrush, but I had some money in a health spending account to use up. I read a lot of reviews before buying.Pros: My teeth feel very clean after using. It can reach places that a regular toothbrush couldn\'t. The construction feels pretty strong and reliable. I like the external readout, and having a clock in the bathroom is handy.Cons: Expensive.  The feel in the hand is a little big and clunky. All the various speed settings seem a little pointless...probably one or two settings would be fine. The flossing brush head doesn\'t feel like it really flosses/gets between teeth, the polishing brush head doesn\'t seem like it does anything special.  I mostly stick w/ the sensitive brush head.If it lasts me 5 years and results in good checkups, it will have been worth it."

Seriously, though, these pads are the best available right now for those of us who are tired of the monthly hassles of staining sheets while sleeping and pants while sitting for long periods of time.  I\'ve been using Always pads for years now because I found them to be the most comfortable and effective option on the market, but even their overnight pads couldn\'t keep up with my body on heavy days, not to mention the crime scene-style sheet stains that would greet me in the morning if I rolled onto my back while sleeping.  With these, though, I can sleep without fear!  The pad is very long and provides great coverage for the back of the underpants, where blood tends to flow, especially while lying on one\'s back.  If you\'re used to tampons or super-thin pads, I\'m sure one of these will feel like a diaper, but as someone used to needing to wear overnight pads, I find them quite comfortable and not at all bothersome.  I\'ll keep buying \'em as long as Always keeps making \'em."

While I have been blessed with a cavity free mouth, I still hate enduring the scrape of the dentist\'s tools against my teeth. And I know it\'s just a matter of time until the dentist breaks out his drill...It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  You can probably chalk it up to \'user error\'....  I wasn\'t brushing properly, nor long enough to really keep a clean mouth.I did a bunch of research on electric toothbrushes to see what the fuss was about. Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  hmmm...  more research led me to this model - the motorized head rotates in the recommended pattern and the handle buzzes/vibrates in 30 or 45 second intervals to help you judge the brushing time of each section of your mouth.  Recommended time is 30 seconds per quadrant.  But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn\'t enough for me.  What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up) the amount of time you have been brushing.  If you look at the picture of the box, you can see the digital display, it\'s a little bit bigger than a business card, and about an inch thick.  As you are brushing, the display will track the quadrant you are brushing, and when your brush handle buzzes, the digital display will move to the next quadrant - giving you a visual que to move on to the next section of your mouth. It will even tell you if you\'re brushing too hard! When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds... the smiley face will wink at you!  :  It\'s a flirty toothbrush!My husband and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  We absolutely love them.  We recieved them two days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.  I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn\'t a big deal. I never have to wonder if I\'m brushing properly or if I\'m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \'fresh from the dentist\' clean mouth.  The handle holds its\' charge for a long time, I can brush for 2 1/2 minutes twice a day, for 9 days before having to recharge - however, I usually keep the brush handle in the charger when it\'s not in use.I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  The travel case is a hard, sturdy plastic to protect the brush handle, and the detachable brush.  It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly. My toothbrush will never again travel in a ziploc baggie.  :) Yay!I did have a little bit of sticker shock when I purchased two of these at the same time, and then again when I saw the cost of replacement brush heads.  But I feel like I am taking good care of my teeth, and I know my next dentist appointment will be less stressful.  Also - I know P&G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time. This makes me feel like I\'ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  Plus P&G offers coupons on their website all the time, so I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.This model isn\'t just an electric toothbrush - It\'s quality control for your mouth!  I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  Happy Brushing."

But I dreamed of something softer, something that wasn\'t rubbing against me and causing me irritation.  Finally, Always Infinity came along, and I\'ve been thrilled!Infinity Heavy Flow is perfect for  when I\'m having a heavy flow or need prolonged protection at night, when I need my pad to provide me with plenty of absorption.  The wings keep the pad secure, they actually wrap around and stick to my panty and the softness keeps me comfortable.  I like not thinking about my pad.  I also like that the pad is designed to be wider in the back.  I\'ve had experiences where my flow completely missed the pad, due to it being too short.  Length is very important if you\'re sitting or laying down for long periods of time.  Also, this is a good pad if you\'re a plus-sized lady.  What length size you choose also depends on your weight too, not just your flow.Out of the various pads that I\'ve purchased, I find that the Infinity series is a bit more expensive, but it is worth the extra change for the comfort and security.  Always Infinity Regular was my go to pad, but now, since trying out the Infinity Heavy Flow, I think I\'ll start using these for nighttime. A big plus, is that this brand comes in unscented, yea!  I don\'t have to worry about irritation due to deodorants that don\'t mask anything.  If you haven\'t tried this brand, do so, you will notice the comfort, immediately."

This is the first pad where I actually was able to use the wings simply to secure and hold the pad in place...as opposed to normal/larger pads, with which I tend to use the wings as a \'belt\' to strap the pad into place, so that the wings significantly overlap on the outside of the panty material. really annoying, uncomfortable, and does not offer much leak protection. These slender pads are great - they do not seem to wick away moisture as well as some other pads with a cotton-y surface that remains dry while pulling moisture into the \'core\' of the pad. in fact, the \'mesh,\' surface layer of these pads seems to pull away from the bottom/stick part of the pad if they are too saturated. however, obviously, if your flow is that heavy, you should be changing your pad more often...lady life lessons!bottom-line though, there is no fault of these pads that outweigh the advantage of the appropriate size and \'stay-in-place\' fit.

Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before. This model features a two-minute timer, which is helpful. It\'s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well (I use it twice a day, and only need to charge it about once every eight days).Oral-b manufactures a variety of different heads for the Vitality line, and though I\'ve not tested the different varieties to see if they have markedly different results, I like the fact that the product is so well-supported; it means I probably won\'t soon find myself owning an obsolete brush for which I can\'t get replacement heads.

I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn. Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head. I have been shaving my head for 10 years and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head, I couldn\'t believe how baby skin soft my head felt. Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head. I shave my head once a day and sometimes twice. On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times. I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried. I have had no razor burn or cuts with this Power Proglide razor.  I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush. I can honestly say that there is not too much difference with using these shaving gels/soaps with the Gillette Power Proglide.The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin. I can usually get about 5 complete head shaves (several times with the grain and against the grain) and beard shaves  with one razor before I need to replace it. The trimmer is quite helpful to trim around and outline my beard, goatee, mustache and even the occasional eyebrow. The only negative for this razor is the price.If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.    "

I will never go back to my original razor choice again.First thing I noticed was how the Venus 5-blade razor with its ribbon of moisture \'zipped\' across my skin and removed all the hair smoothly, easily, quickly, and completely on the first stroke every time.  I had not even realized the \'drag\' I was experiencing with my original razor choice until I felt how smoothly the Venus razor did its work. I had just shaved my legs the previous day, but my razor had \'given out\' just before completing my shave and one leg had not gotten a smooth shave.  Trying Venus Embrace the next day, not only did I get an immediate and smooth shave on the \'unfinished\' leg, but on reshaving the \'completely shaved\' leg, I found that that I actually had not gotten a really thorough shave on it the day before either.I have always resisted those shaped, fat-handled razors because they look bulky.  My regular razor was thin and straight-handeled.  Now I see what all the hype is about.  The handle is comfortable, fits perfectly into the hand, is soft to the touch, and is wonderfully positioned.  It just feels \'good\' in my hand.  Actually it feels \'great\'.No \'suctioned-cupped\' item has ever seemed to work for me.  If they stuck at all, they were generally on the floor the next day.  Therefore I originally didn\'t intend to even try the showerpod.  After reconsidering how helpful it would be to have all my shaving utensils available inside the tub/shower area, I positioned it where I thought it would be handy if it would stick and affixed the suction cups.  Voila, it not only stuck, it is still there weeks later, never having come \'unstuck\' even once.While I regret my stubborness to give the newer-styled ladies razors a chance; I am completely sold on this Venus Embrance razor and anticipate it will be a long time before I think about changing razor brands again.

Try DE Shaving!!","I\'ve used each new version of the Gillette series since I started shaving.  (my first razor was the Gillette Sensor)I do believe this gives me the best shave from Gillette since I started using their cartridge razors.  The problem is that with each new razor comes a price increase.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor cartridges sells for $3.50-$4.00 per cartridge...Ouch!!  Thinking for years that buying the 4 and 8 pack refills was a rip-off, I looked into DE shaving.  I bought an old Gillette Super Speed safety razor and a sample pack Double Edge razor blades and started learning the proper way to shave.  A little math now...at $3.50/cartridge for Gillette Fusion I will spend $182.00/year for razors.  I can\'t use them for more than a week.  In fact the proglide razor seems to lose performance after the 3rd shave for me, but I push it to 6 shaves.  I can buy a 100 pack of Astra DE razor blades for $15.75.  That\'s (rounded up) $.16/razor.  I can use them for 1 week also, so I spend $8.32/year for DE razors.  After a couple month of learning to shave with a DE razor I\'m now getting the same (if not better) results than I get with the Fusion Pro Glide.  The only advantage that the Fusion ProGlide has over old school DE razors is that it is a little quicker, but $173.68 per year in savings is enough to get me off the cartridge razor bandwagon, and into the Double Edge Razor bandwagon.  To me it\'s just common sense.    "

Though it neither possesses zillions of blades nor vibrates, it shaves closer than razors that do. Cartridges for it are also slightly cheaper than those for the Mach 3 or other high-end razors.These 5-count packages (bundled in packs of 2) are also a phenomenally good deal, especially if you purchase them using Amazon\'s subscribe-and-save. My only complaint is that, in these bundles, the blue lubricating strip normally at the top of the razor has been replaced by a white and noticeably less lubricating version. Still, this is a good buy.    "
2065,1645,1698,20090903,B001JQLNGY,3,"September 3, 2009",A1GGURQ9CHSLEG,"Almost perfect, still room for improvement","I\'ve been using Gillette Custom Plus twin blade disposables for years. After trying their Custom Plus3 and being extremely disappointed, I decided to give Sensor3 a try. They are exponentially better than Custom Plus3, but they still don\'t come close to the original Custom Plus as far as the quality of the lubrication strip and overall comfort are concerned. The razor tends to drag on your skin, leading to razor burn. Why Gillette can\'t use the same quality lubrication strip on Sensor3 as they do on the Custom Plus twin is beyond me. I would also prefer a non-pivot head to give me better control over the shaving angle, but that\'s more of a personal preference. It does not do all that great of a job on the chin and directly under the nose. The angle of the blades does not allow for good surface contact in these areas and can lead to nicks. Also, for my beard, each razor is single-use regardless of the brand, so I need to get the most bang for my buck. These come in a bit on the high-priced side, so that reflects negatively as well. I\'d give it 5 stars for the quality of the shave, subtract one star for the price factor (Amazon\'s price here is *ridiculous*! You can easily get these for 30-40% less in any store, but that is still expensive on a per-razor basis) and subtract one more star for the not-so-great lubrication strip (better than Custom Plus3, but still not as good as it could be). Overall, I will continue to use these, in conjunction with the original Gillette Custom Plus.    "

I have resisted this purchase for years, but it has become apparent that I really needed to get one.  Research indicated that this was the best brush as far as effectiveness.I\'m not all that excited about vibrating toothbrushes--reminds me a lot of going to the dentist.  But this really isn\'t so bad.  I was a little skeptical--but after feeling the \'dentist clean\' feeling, I was sold.  I love that the brush stops if i try to brush too hard.  the little display that shows the quadrants and how long you are brushing is a little helpful--although certainly not a selling feature in my book.  funny though, i found as did many reviewers, that this serves as a great bathroom clock!The information on amazon can be a bit confusing.  You get a travel case, charger, 2 brush tips (1 pro white and 1 floss), and the display.The handle is a bit on the large size and i\'m not sure it would be good for children.  I prefer smaller handles, however, they can\'t fit all that computer programming into a smaller handle.You do have to practice a bit at keeping your mouth closed enough that the toothbrush doesn\'t spray.  But it has never been a real issue for me--i would say any spray has been minimal.  And every electric toothbrush has this issue.I prefer the smaller brush head on these to the larger brush heads.  on normal toothbrushes I prefer full size brush heads--but when you have a large handle, it seems much more maneuverable to have the smaller head.  And it doesn\'t feel stranger or bother me--i adapted on first use.When you are done using, it is best to remove brush from handle and thoroughly run it under water.  This can prevent toothpaste from building up.Oral B has a 60 day try it guarantee and will refund your money if you are not happy.  That seems like a good deal."

If you are like me with 5 men in the house, you can probably use the six cans pretty easily. We aren\'t even that hairy of a bunch, so your mileage may vary based on your level of wolverinism and the number  people you have.In terms of the cream itself, I\'m a big fan of foam over gel as you don\'t have to wait for it to foam, you get a better idea of how much you are using and I think it works better to lubricate and hydrate the face. Gillette\'s is good at all that. I don\'t have sensitive skin, but I\'ve always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.Everything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream.

I\'ve been using Gillette Mach3 Turbo blades for years, and frankly got tired of paying $3.05/per blade at my local grocery store. I shopped Amazon to look for a cheaper price, and came across these Sensor3 disposable blades which are getting fantastic reviews (for some reason). I thought I\'d give them a try, seeing how they\'re almost 1/2 the cost (per blade) as my non-disposable Turbo blades. WHAT A MISTAKE! These blades are comparatively very dull right out of the box compared to the Turbo blades, and I\'m lucky if I can get 3 shaves out of them before needing to throw them away. Worse yet, they do NOT provide a close shave, they nick the hell out of my face, and sometimes that occurs on the very first use of a brand-new blade. Still, I thought I better do a cost comparison, since the Turbo blades are so much more expensive. So, here\'s the net-net:Sensor3 Disposables: $1.57/per razor, $0.52/per shave (based on 3-shave average per blade)Mach3 Turbo Non-Disposable: $3.05/per razor, $0.43/per shave (based on 7-shave average per blade)When you factor in that I\'m getting a much closer and complete shave with the Mach3, virtually zero nicks (I average probably 1x every 6 months at most), and better pricing on my Mach3\'s online, I\'m not going to be buying any more Sensor3 blades...

In my mind, I couldn\'t imagine a more comfortable shave than what I was already getting with my Mach3.  Yesterday, I was at the store to buy a new Mach3 because my old handle had worn down over the years, and I finally decided to give one of Gilette\'s newer razors a try.I ended up getting a manual Fusion Proglide, and I was absolutely thrilled during my first shave with it this morning.  It was by far the best shave I have ever experienced!  The Proglide is so smooth, it hardly felt like there were any blades on the thing as I ran it over my skin.  It felt so nice, I am looking forward to using it again tomorrow morning (instead of waiting my usual two days).Unfortunately, although the razor package that comes with the handle is not much more expensive than some of the older Gilette razors, the replacement blades are noticeably more expensive.  I generally use my blades longer than most, but if you tend to run through new blades pretty quickly, using the Proglide may end up getting costly.  Regardless, I am now hooked on this thing already and will be sticking to this product.  For me, it\'s definitely worth the increased price, because I can\'t imagine having a better shave than what I experienced this morning!    "

It\'s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \'sonic\' movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts. The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \'floss action\' rubber points work quite differently as well. At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth. Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice. I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.(One small issue wroth noting: all the included tooth brush heads look the same.

After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I\'ve been doing pretty well with the cheap Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary). Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.It\'s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it\'s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn\'t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that\'s it. I think that when the battery dies it\'s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn\'t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don\'t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn\'t a concern for me. I\'m planning to buy this brush for my children to try. For an entry level power brush, this is a solid choice."

The difference was immediate. My first visit to the hygienist after two months use astounded her. She told me she had allowed an hour for my cleaning as the calculus buildup on my teeth had been graded C on my visit 6 months previously. She said it was now an A, and was finished in 20 minutes(No discount). She was impressed that the only difference was an Oral B electric with the floss brush-head. As for the 5000 the difference is noticeable. Much longer battery life. Where the 3D was good for 3 minutes and then needed an hour charge. The 5000 will go at least 5 minutes with full power. Probably more. I got bored and ended my experiment after 5 minutes. I also like the fact it is only high speed with a 30 second pulse. I never saw the need for a slower speed option. The 5000 also has an open charging stand, eliminating the gunk buildup the 3D was prone to, and taking less counter space. As for the clock, I have no idea what it\'s for. Set up is simple. Just plug in the charger and set the brush on. The display will let you know when you\'re ready to go. And best of all you can\'t screw it up. The battery will hold a full charge whether you brush 1 minute or 5. No worries about running it down to achieve full charge like many cell phones.

Kind of like the old vibrating toothbrushes from long ago, except the power behind this is far greater, and much more effective.Sonicare had the benefit of being first with this type of brush, but Oral-B has an advantage in that they can study the other product and make improvements on it.  I\'d say the major difference is that the Oral-B is thinner, lighter, and therefore easier to hold and maneuver around the mouth.  The replacement brushes are also less expensive on this model, which is important as they can really add up if you replace them as recommended by the manufacturer, every three months or so.I was pleased to see that toothpaste can be used with it, although if you use too much you\'ll be foaming at the mouth from the ultrasonics.  It is still pretty foamy, so I recommend staying close to the sink.The recharging base is small, attractive, and wall-mountable.  The power cord plugs into a wall outlet and doesn\'t use a transformer, so it won\'t take up additional outlets. It will hold two spare brush heads behind the toothbrush, and allows the toothbrush to be dropped in facing any direction.  So, when you are done it is an easy matter to drop the toothbrush back onto its base.It actually worked quite a bit better than I expected.  The head is fairly small, so it is easy to move around your mouth to clean each tooth.  The timer lets you know if you are rushing the job (I usually am, but at least now I can\'t pretend I don\'t know that!).  The massage mode for the brush seems like a feature that I\'ll never use, but people with tender gums that are working their way up to the full speed might like it.  I use mine on clean mode all the time and it works well.  It is somewhat annoying that both modes are accessible through the single button given that I never use the lower-speed.  It isn\'t so annoying that it is a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.I was happy with the noise level, too.  Nothing bugs me more than holding something that sounds like a buzz saw so close to my ear in the morning.  Mercifully, this brush is pretty quiet, as these things go.  It is louder than a manual brush, of course, but quieter than an electric shaver.  The pitch is a little high, but nothing I can\'t live with.Overall, I like it and would get it again.

HOWEVER, sometimes the need arises for a disposable razor...and when that time comes, consider reaching for a Gillette Good News razor.Aesthetics: 3 stars. There certainly isn\'t anything to look at on this razor. Lately, many of the big names (Fusion, Quattro) have been marketed in special colors and designs. This is plain razor with a plastic blue handle. The end. Yet, in its understated styling, it still has good features for a cheap disposable: pivoting head (non-pivot style available), lubrastrip, good blade angle.The shave: 4 stars. Yep, this thing ranks right up there with the big boys. It is a close and very comfortable shave. If you\'ve got sensitive skin (like me), the Good News performs quite nicely. It\'s a close shave without ripping a layer of skin off. Cuts are highly unlikely (unless the blade is dull, of course). The lubrastrip provides a small level of glide, but a good shaving cream/gel is recommended with this razor.Durability: 3 stars. I\'ve had disposables that lasted just one shave, others that last a week or more. This one is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack with regard to durability. I typically get three shaves out of a Good News razor.Conclusion: Good shave, ideal for people with sensitive skin. They don\'t last long, but the upside is that they are among the lowest-priced disposables on the market. Recommended.    "

Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you\'re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.I\'ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it\'s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won\'t last long.  I can bring my Triumph on a 10 day vacation without the charging unit (and I brush twice a day.)  I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn\'t have a big enough battery to do that.  And even if it does, that just goes to show you the cleaning power.  This one is subtle, and good if you have sensitive teeth and gums.So if you want a good, deep clean, buy the Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide."

On the plus side it really hugs your face, shaves cleanly with a single pass, and doesn\'t nick or abrade the skin. Even the edges under the jaw line came clean. I hate shaving and often skip weekends yet find that it works quite well on one, two, or even three day\'s worth of growth. Haven\'t gone longer than that so I couldn\'t say for sure but seems like it\'d do okay for another day or two. Any longer and it would take a pass with an electric trimmer to shorten things up first. The handle is nicely ergonomic too, easy to grip and control when wet. On the minus side the single trim blade doesn\'t work horribly well, at least not for me. I\'ve got to even up my sideburns and trim around my goatee and this just doesn\'t do the trick. Considering what they cost, the blades don\'t last as long as I\'d like either. I\'ve used it regularly for about three weeks and it\'s just starting to dull enough to consider changing the blade. Might be able to stretch it another week but that might be pushing it. Considering that I can go a year with an electric model (Braun) on a single blade/screen set I\'d think they could make a manual that lasts more than a month...Despite the downside, it\'s the best manual razor I\'ve used so far. Quick, clean, comfortable shave... Got one as a free promotion and liked it enough to pick up a pack of refill cartridges. They are a bit pricey but not overmuch. I expect to continue using it for some time to come.   "

They would last a LONG time, up to 6-12 shaves depending on frequency and amount needed to be shaved. These last on average 2-3 shaves before they start becoming painful. I hadn\'t said anything so far, continuing to give them a chance, but today, I shaved and the blue bar that tells you to replace the razor is gone. One shave, and gone. Now, I know this isn\'t a magical indicator of some kind, but every other fusion blade I\'ve used from the store has had the blue bar on there for about as long as the razor quality lasts. It has been a reliable indicator in the past. One shave! I\'m very annoyed with these razors and finally had to say something.

I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Also, before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.    "

EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as \'Clean Shower\' or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.)Then I set the razor so it\'s standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I\'d also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I\'ve been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I\'ve nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I\'m very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.)Note to Gillette...

I\'ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  My gums also feel massaged by the vibratory scrubbing they receive, hence that just-went-to-the-dentist feeling without the paperwork, wait, or cost."

Second, despite the fact that I\'m no longer scrubbing my teeth with all my strength (I actually use the lighter \'Sensitive\' setting with the sensitive brush heads), my teeth look and feel much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush, there\'s less noticeable plaque buildup, and I\'ve been able to maintain that just-cleaned-at-the-dentist feeling for over a month (as opposed to a few days before).

The Sensor Excel blades were the first among Gillette razors to add rubberized \'microfins\' at the bottom of the cartridges...a standard they have included on every Gillette produce since Excel\'s debut. But with so many razors brought to market since its rollout, how does Sensor Excel stand up to competition today?Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor Excel. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Excel cartridges are noticeably smaller than, say, Mach 3 cartridges (about 1/3 smaller). The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than most razor systems today. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are very easy to shave as a result.The shave: 4.5 stars. One can tell that this truly was Gillette\'s workhorse model for quite some time, and that a lot of research & development went into the creation of this system. The Sensor Excel offers a comfortable shave with minimal drag, leaving the user feeling clean and smooth. As stated above, the blade angle and smaller cartridge design allows for easy precision shaving of sideburns and moustache/goatee areas--an ideal choice for men who maintain those types of facial hair. It is noteworthy that, as a person with sensitive skin, I felt no facial sensitivity after shaving with the Sensor Excel--something that I cannot say about newer razors such as Quattro and Fusion. For those with sensitive skin, this would perhaps be a wise choice.Durability: 2.5 stars. This was where Sensor Excel disappointed me. I get, at most, three shaves out of one cartridge. Drag and other issues resulting from dull blades arose quickly after two to three shaves. It\'s safe to say Sensor Excel has been surpassed by newer razors that have better blade coatings. By comparison, during my testing of the Gillette Fusion I got almost two weeks out of one cartridge. However, with the steep cost of blades for newer razors, Sensor Excel may still be a more affordable option.Overall: A fine razor offering a no-frills kind of approach to shaving. No advertising or fancy marketing to deal with when it comes to Sensor Excel--just a razor that does what it\'s supposed to do, well. Durability comes into question here as newer razors offer better blade coatings, but still a smart choice for those who don\'t buy into (and don\'t need) the uber-bladed razor trend. Recommended.

These wells increase the total surface area that liquid is in contact with the absorbent material and so the liquid not only passes through the surface layer faster, but it also gets absorbed faster by the inner material.Overall, this product does exactly what it claims to do.

I packaged up the entire original package as new, including the box, original receipt, and the cheesy complaint card you are entitled to write as per their refund guidelines. It cost me $12 to send all of this. Months later (seriously - like 2 1/2 months later!)they sent me back a letter & my receipt claiming that they cannot fulfill my request because I \'did not include the UPC code\'. The UPC code was on their packing!!! I sent it all back like new!!! More than they asked for!!!So - not only did I waste my time and an additional $12...but Gillette is wasting resources mailing this joke back to me...hence their costly product.I attribute this little event to Gilette not caring for my original review here on Amazon (below)...Hey America! Are why are we falling for this? Surely there are more of you who have noticed this disturbing trend of late?I am of Italian heritage with a heavy beard - I shave more whiskers in one stroke than most peach-fuzz Caucasians shave in a whole week...So if I don\'t need all these blades & tacky gimmicks - then no one does.All anyone requires is the original twin blade Sensor - loud, proud & simple. Easy to use with well-balanced quality. That was the Gillette I stuck with for many years. The Sensor was not impossibly wide/no annoying rubber fins/no vibrations/no batteries/no hype.This gimmicky, bulky, and overpriced nightmare fails to last any longer than a simple Sensor twin blade - here\'s why:The 5 blades here work well for the open expanse areas of the face...great. But they are way too wide to get at any tight spots like under your nose, upper lip, or any side-burn/mustache trimming. Gillette\'s solution is to flip over to a single trimming blade on the back. But here is where this entire concept fails: now we are down to the use & life of just this one blade!Get it?Once this one \'trimming\' blade is dull, the whole $3.00+ blade goes in the garbage!So really - it does not last any longer than a twin blade! With the old Sensor, we had the advantage of two blades hitting all the tight spots.And then there is this useless & goofy \'power\' business. So now, not only are we being forced to fork over $3.00+ per blade...but now we also have to start buying batteries. Gillette\'s stance on the environment? Well evidently their position is to now have millions more batteries going into our landfills. Lovely.And yes, Gillette is clearly bullying the marketplace as we longtime loyal customers can no longer find our favorites in the stores. And if we do - they are now priced double of what they were just a few short years ago. In fact, last time I found my Sensors at Walmart - there was a big sticker on the box asking the customer to call a 1-800 number to inform them if we \'see this product being sold elsewhere\'!! So much for competition and the free market economy!I remember everyone used to just go into the shaving aisle at the stores, grab their fave blades and leave. Now these aisles are full of price-shocked guys standing around scratching their heads, wondering what to do.OK, I understand that Gillette cannot effectively inventory all the retailers with every generation of product they ever made. I also believe in the evolution and optional availability of an evolved product. But give us the option of buying a simple twin blade at an affordable price and keep it readily available. But here Gillette has us over the barrel and is literally forcing everyone to pay a premium for what many of us do not believe is any better (in fact - annoyingly worse).If not, then I would say that this is an opportune time for the competition like Wilkinson Sword to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price. They would clean house. Unfortunately, I myself have not experimented much with the competition because of hit & miss availability. Don\'t want to find something one week - and then get stuck without the next. Hopefully that will now change.    "

What I mean is that the recharge station and linking area on the brush are all both entirely covered in plastic, so there are no \'vulnerable\' spots for bathroom water to reach to short things out or gum up the works.I also find that I take longer brushing my teeth when I use an electric brush, I\'m not sure why I do so, I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.There is one major design flaw though. The moving bristle head has too much clearance between it and the rest of the brush, because it regularly, at least once a day, pinches the inside of my lips or cheeks, often to the point of breaking the skin, and at least once a week bad enough to make my spit turn completely red.It could be that my brush head is defective, I don\'t know, but it definitely happens, and it never happened with any of my previous electric toothbrushes."

I was truly sad when the poor ol\' guy bit the dust. After a week without an electric toothbrush I realized I needed to get another and researched Sonicare vs. OralB/Braun. I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn\'t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 & 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I\'m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn\'t expecting that big of a difference.The only thing I don\'t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn\'t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn\'t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.

It took me a while to read the manual, I didn\'t think it was all that clear on what I was supposed to do (I\'ve never owned one before) but it turns out that it\'s a lot easier than the manual suggests.3. I\'m not certain if the pressure signal works appropriately. After starting to use it, my teeth started to become more sensitive.

The good news is that, while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the problem.  In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades).  The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area).  If you have sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you.Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra \'trimming\' blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.However, the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast.  Considering my rather fine hairs, I\'m used to exchanging blades once every week or so.  Now I\'m exchanging them twice a week.  Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors\' products, and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to recommend.

But is it sigificantly better than the original fusion? This is what I\'ve found. I shave in the shower, warm water, using a unscented Gillette shaving gel. The handle of the proglide has a slightly different shape, more of a knob at the end. I suppose the knobv makes it easier to grasp the end of the razor when making gentle swipes alog the skin, sort of an artist at work. But the handle of the original fusion is also okay, and I don\'t think the new handle is much of an improvement, if any. The blades in  the cartridge are great, more than marginally better than the original. A few easy swipes do the job for most of the face. I\'ve found the razor shaves closer than the original about the neck and above the upper lip. Result is the shave time is quicker with a good result. I also believe a proglide cartridge will last longer than the fusion. I\'ve used one cartridge for about twenty shaves, and so far it is doing the job. thus, since the cartridge seems to give more shaves, that fact ought to offset the extra cost. Bottom line is, the new proglide fusion is great, better than the original, but since the original fusion cartridges also do a great jobb, I plan to use them up before switching over to the proglide.Update april 2011 - I think the proglide works best for men who shave every day, and against the grain for a close shave. The blades are thin and close and work best with short hairs. When shaving with two or more days of growth, hthen it\'s best to first shave downward, with the grain, and then up against the grain to get a close shave.    "

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.    "

I\'ve been a big fan of the M3Power since its release.  I didn\'t buy in to the hype of the Quattro, especially since it\'s a manual razor.  I thought, \'three blades is good enough, what good could four blades do???\'  I only picked up the Fusion because I\'ve never had a bad experience with a Gillette razor...even when I picked up this Fusion, I was a little skeptical about the difference five blades would have over three.  BOY, was I wrong.  It\'s been written in a few other reviews here, but it bears repeating:  This is easily the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had.  Moving with the grain, it doesn\'t even feel like a razor is touching your face.  Even going against the grain, there\'s smooth action and no nicks.the only problem i had was with the head being a little too big to effectively catch the area under your nose.  HOWEVER, there is a single blade on the back of the cartridge for this exact purpose.  I applaud Gillette for the research and customer feedback that went in to the design of this razor.I hate to sound like a commercial, but my wife felt my face after I shaved, and she said that it was the smoothest my face has ever been.  I\'m VERY satisfied with my purchase, and you will be too.  I love this razor (as much as a man is allowed to love a razor.)    "

And I\'ve been flushing them with some apprehension even though the box says it\'s okay. Bad, bad, bad. They really effed up a classic brand here. Tampax tampons are inferior to just about every other tampon available now.Pearl is the only Tampax style worth considering...and even then there are cheaper and better tampons, such as Kotex Security, Playtex Gentle Glide, and Playtex Sport.I would only buy these again if absolutely nothing else were available to me."

The two speed mode is nice and easy to operate.  The brush head has been safe and secure with no evidence that it could come off as some report.  While I agree with those who would like to have a travel case, this brush fits easily into a plastic sandwich bag.  Overall a great purchase experience and a very good product so far.

Now I don\'t have to rummage around soapy and dripping to find a replacement in the drawer when my blade is dull- it is right there and ready to go!I like something easy to grip.

It\'s triple blade design seems like overkill, I mean really, I can get just as close of shaves with a classic DE safety razor, and have less razor burn. If you haven\'t learned already, more blades dragging across the surface of the skin means increased chance for razor burn, it\'s just that simple. So while this razor is less prone to give razor burn than the 4 and 5 blade designs, it\'s still going to be worse than a 2 or single blade design. We\'re talking about human body hair here, we\'re not using it to shave an angora rabbit.The 3 blades are spaced well enough apart that they don\'t easily clog, and rinse very easily. The handle is nicely contoured and easy to hold without slippage at most any angle, and is textured enough not to be slippery when all soapy. Speaking of soapy, those little goo-bars on the razor are awful. They turn to slime, clear slime like when you blow your nose with a bad head-cold. It\'s just stringy and disgusting looking. They also do little to help the blades glide over wet skin. I ended up with the worst razor burn I\'ve ever had by trying to use this razor on wet skin. Once I went back to foaming up my legs with a super-slick tallow shaving soap, I was able to get irritation free shaves.The little goo bars don\'t last past 4 shaves for me before they\'re gone. They don\'t last nearly as long as the blades stay sharp. Cost-wise I\'m not thrilled either, with the price of the cartridge refills. Once these cartridges are depleted I\'ll be happily going back to my M&Uuml;HLE R89 razor with Gillette 7 O\'Clock SharpEdge blades.    "

Ladies, you know how it is, after a couple of decades, shaving your legs becomes a chore to dread. The Venus Embrace has eased that chore for me. I\'ve used Venus products for several years, but this one is miles ahead of past versions, and it does everything it claims to do.Yes, it is comfortable to hold--rather like those pens with the soft rubbery stuff on the outside. I think it makes the razor less slippery in your hand as well. That\'s important in the shower especially. The holder is oddly shaped, but there are no hinges to open or to break. Time will tell if that open design is a good thing or not. It did fit well and unobtrusively in my cramped shower. I loved the suction cups though as opposed to the old sticky stuff.The most important thing, however, is the actual results from using the Venus Embrace. Here, it really shined. Smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I deliberately made only one pass to see how well the product worked. Perfect! One pass was all that was needed; my legs were smooth, hair-free, and without a single nick or scrape. There was a slight scrape on my underarm, but that could have been user error.

That aside the problem with this pad is that while designedfor heavy flow, it actually is not a good pad to depend upon when you have heavy flow. The fatal flaw is that all liquid hits the pad at a specific spot, but goes under what you can visibly see. So in other words, when you check the panit may seem as though there is only a little bit of fluid. However, once you remove the pad you seethat all of the fluid is kept away from sight under the initial layer of cotton. The reason this isproblematic is that it interfere with your ability to correctly judge when the pad is actually FULL.And if you misjudge that, the pad will overflow!Typically all other pads you can visible see how much fluid is on it  and can easily determine when itneeds to be changed. But with infinity, while it may hold a lot, it\'s to scary to trust. To get an accurate understanding of how full the pad actually is, you need to look at the back. I think thispad is best used for average flow. and heavy flow should be left to any other pads in their line thatdon\'t use this \'hide the fluid\' technology."

The strength of the brushing on \'normal\' mode is certainly not gentle, but then again, that\'s what the \'sensitive\' mode is for. We always use the normal mode and we\'ve had no issues. The \'Floss Action\' heads seem to work quite well to remove some of the inter-dental debris, but flossing is still necessary.We were a little skeptical about the SmartGuide, but since buying this toothbrush was part of our plan to improve dental hygiene, we decided to give it a shot. We mounted it on the bathroom wall next to the mirror. The thing quickly detects when you start brushing and shows you a diagram and a timer, so you know how long you need to brush. The rest of the time, it\'s a handy clock! We actually really like it. It was worth spending a few extra bucks to get it.All in all, it was a great purchase and a huge step up from using a regular toothbrush. I would recommend it to anyone."

It doesn\'t really matter what the product states it can do as it all comes down to personal preference. Here\'s my two cents:The pluses:Can\'t see it. It does stick to its promise in that it doesn\'t show on your clothing. Black or otherwise. (if you accidentally put on too much then it will show)While I did find that the scent hits you very strongly at first it does tone down shortly after applying. Oddly enough others asked what I was wearing and told me it was very pleasant.Applying this deodorant was fairly easy. With other stick deodorants it feels like you\'re rubbing a rock under your arm, uncomfortable. This was unlike others and applied smoothly.The big minus:Kind of uncomfortable. While application is pretty smooth actually wearing it is not. After wearing it for a couple of hours it begins to, for lack of a better word, chafe. The downfall of stick deodorant begins to shine through. As the moisture of the deodorant begins to disappear you are left with a powdery irritating feeling.The Rundown:I work in an office and don\'t really find myself in the situations where I\'m sweating profusely. Because of this the anti-perspiration factor is, to me, not needed. A product that is strictly deodorant tends to work best.I\'ll be sticking to my Old Spice Red Zone. However, if your job requires you to work in high heat, or you work out often this deodorant will work best in those conditions.    "

These are made from what I can only describe as a \'Dr. Scholl\'s-like\' material.  The pad is VERY comfortable and definitely breathes.  If you\'re an active female, or have an extremely heavy flow, then you should definitely be conscious of having to change out the pad throughout the day.  These Infinity pads are SUPER absorbent - what\'s seen on the surface of the pad is only about 1/3 of what\'s actually being held.  So please keep that in mind.  I normally have a heavy flow and sometimes had issues at night (I sleep on my belly) and that was always a big problem during \'my time\' when the pad I\'d use would leak.  Not at all the case with these!Always Infinity DOES tend to cost more than other brands, but if you keep an eye out (as I do) you can find a decent in-store sale.

The little vibrating action of the battery powered handle really made a huge difference in how easy it was to shave, and the razor glided right through thick stubble with no problem at all.  The thinner blades didn\'t clog up and washed out pretty easy (which was a HUGE complaint about my older Fusion), and after using it for a few weeks, the blade is duller but not as nick happy as I thought it would be.So while the hype is still pretty big, I was surprised at how genuinely good this razor ended up being.The bad part?  Well, this thing is EXPENSIVE.  The handle is affordable, but you\'re paying $22 for 6 refills.  Thats unbelievable!  Especially since I can get 5 blades for a dollar with my safety razor.All in all, its a great razor, but its super expensive to buy cartridges.  If you can afford it, you\'ll like it.

I wanted to see if a less expensive electric toothbrush, if it was comparable to the more expensive electric toothrushes, like the one I have been using for years now, and have been very satisfied with.This electric toothbrush doesn\'t have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive electric toothbrush, such as the ability to choose from more than one setting, or a UV sanitizer.I have to say tho that this electric toothbrush made my teeth feel like they were really being scrubbed, so when I was finished using it, my teeth felt very clean.  This electric toothbrush came with 2 brush heads, which seem alittle bigger than the more tapered ones Iam used to using, and this motor seemed to be alittle louder. It actually would slow down, then rev back up.  The automatic timer on this electric toothbrush is supposed to run for 2 minutes, but mine seemed to run for much longer than that, so I went with it.My other electric toothbrush runs for 3 minutes at the setting I use, so I didn\'t mind this.  You always have the option of just turning it off when you want to.I wish this electric toothbrush came with some kind of cover for the toothbrush heads, and some kind of travel case, but for the excellent price of this electric toothrush I can\'t complain.  It does come with a rechargeable stand, which I just leave my electric toothbrush always plugged in, and on the rechargeable stand.  That way it is always ready to use when I need it.I also like that in reading the information that came with this electric toothbrush, that you have like 5 different options for brush heads, depending on the kind you like.  The brush heads seem to be alittle more reasonably priced too, as I always like to buy a minimum of 3 brush heads at a time.  With this electric toothbrush you can even buy them in a quantity of 6, if you want to.  I like to have enough for a year, which they recommend you change your brush head every 3 months, which I agree, so I do that.If you\'ve always wondered if you would like using an electric toothbrush, but didn\'t want to spend the big bucks, you should try this electric toothbrush.  It works very well, at a reasonable price.The major reason to use an electric toothbrush to begin with is to really clean your teeth and gums, which this one seems to do that as well as my more expensive electric toothbrush.Having healthy teeth and gums is so important to your overall health.  Everyone should be able to afford to have an electric toothbrush. I know some of the electric toothbrushes are cost prohibitive, at over $100, but this Oral B electric toothbrush is under $30, much more doable for alot of people.I will continue to use this electric toothbrush, along with the other electric toothbrush I already have.Iam very happy that I was able to try this product, and very satisfied with the results I got."

I happened to have a Venus Vibrance (which has three blades) in my shower, so I tried the Embrace on one leg and the Vibrance on the other. (I did not turn on the vibration on the Vibrance, because I have never found it to make any difference and because I felt it might skew the experiment.) I put a new blade on the Vibrance, so that both razors were starting out on as level a playing field as possible.There was very little noticeable difference in performance. Both razors shaved my legs smoothly. The only drawback to the Embrace is that it has a slightly larger head, which makes it a little difficult to maneuver around knees and other tricky areas. I saw no difference in closeness of shave between the three and the five-bladed razors; and a few days later, I saw no difference in the amount of stubble.Overall, I\'d say that if you are a first-time Venus buyer, the Embrace is a fine choice; but if you already have a Venus razor, the Embrace really isn\'t an upgrade, and there\'s no reason to buy it.

Either it works or it doesn\'t right?Well in the case of this toothbrush I feel a difference. I\'m not someone who generally goes out of his way to brush my teeth. I don\'t floss, I rarely use mouthwash, and I brush once a day. I figure my teeth can make do. Well after trying this toothbrush my teeth actually feel a bit cleaner than usual. The cost is there though for the initial toothbrush system and I\'m sure replacement heads are equally as expensive so it may not be worth it if you brush often.You do leave with a somewhat polished feeling so it\'s worth a try at least if you\'ve never used a power brusher. It really depends on how much money you want to invest in your teeth. If you\'re like me you\'ll like it but it\'s probably not worth it in the long run."

The razors were ordinary razors, from Gillette. Those razors don\'t come into this tale. But attached to the outside of the pack of ordinary razors was one special razor, a sample of another razor model. This is its story.At first, the special razor lay in the bathroom drawer, watching as ordinary razors were used and thrown away, used and thrown away. It was a lonely existence as the only one of its kind. No bright colors or fancy features made this razor stand out from the crowd. Razors came and razors went as the tough-bearded man shaved his sensitive face.Then one day it was the special razor\'s turn.The first shave was fine, a nice close shave that didn\'t sting that sensitive face. It might even have ended that day, if the rough-bearded man had thrown the special razor in the trash. But he didn\'t, for he was frugal too.The second shave was fine as well.And the third. Unusual, thought the rough-bearded man.But the fourth time he shaved his sensitive face with the special razor is when he began to suspect that this razor was special, indeed. What razor stays sharp for four shaves? And a disposable too! The man felt his smooth skin and wondered if it could be. He set the razor aside just in case, on the slimmest hopes there could be another smooth shave. How wonderful, how magical that would be!The next day came, as they always do. And the rough-bearded man lifted the special razor to his sensitive face. And shaved.No pulling! No stinging! A smooth and silky shave! It was all true. Then the rough-bearded man knew that this was not merely a special razor. Nay, this was indeed -- a Magic Razor!He asked the razor its name. The razor said, \'Gillette Custom Plus 3 Sensitive\'.The rough-bearded man with the sensitive face smiled a wide smile with his smooth skin. Some say the razor smiled too.The End    "

It takes a few days to get used to not using the same rigorous back and forth brushing action, but you get used to it. The secret is in the reciprocating action that allows the brush to get between teeth in ways a normal brush cannot. It also cleans those tough back molars extremely well. The included charger is also 110-220v which is a nice feature for someone who travels a lot and lives in Europe like myself. I was also a little apprehensive about the wireless timer/clock, but after using it for awhile it makes a lot of sense and I like using it. I wish they would include an alarm clock or multiple timezones in future iterations to make it more travel friendly and usable. If there were any downside to this toothbrush it would be in it\'s travel \'footprint\'. Although the case is very nice and holds the brush and two heads, its much larger than a regular brush and will take up more space while traveling. The additional wireless timer adds additional packing requirements (which is why I recommend that they add some more features to the clock to make it more usable and travel friendly). If you don\'t travel much, then the size will be fine for your bathroom and the included stand is nice, functional, and compact. Overall, I strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to bring their oral hygiene to the next level. It\'s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but I guarantee your teeth will feel considerably cleaner and look whiter after using it for only a week or two. Great product!"

Since my return home at the end of 2007, I\'ve been getting a month\'s use per blade on both my face and scalp. I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but, what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long? On the 1st of each month, I replace the old blade with a fresh one. The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months.... You have to admit, that\'s money well spent.I\'ve used all types of blades starting when I was 15...single, double, triple edge blades...Electric shavers, clippers, and even depilatories(which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it, spread it on, wait for it to cure, scrape it off, and wash the excess off my face).

1209,789,815,20061004,B000BUW8WM,3,"October 4, 2006",A4BA2SSCQ2W56,an objective review.,"well well well, i\'ve been on a long search to find the perfect razor and read tons of reviews on every razor out there.  first off, a lot of people are judging this razor very unfairly because they\'re mad about the price of blades.  well, that\'s life.  there\'s a site on the net where you can buy cryogenically frozen blades at about the same price that supposedly last 4 times as long.  they\'re a great business.amazon overall gives the fusion mixed reviews, and i\'ve found the fusion to be a mixed bag.  first, the design.  i loved the mach 3 design and the gillette fusion continues that.  it\'s definitely a better way to shave than with the old designs.  also, the handle on the fusion is insanely comfortable.  it\'s SO comfortable, it\'s almost as if the handle has a life of its own!  it\'s crazy.  way better than any other razor handle ever.  the design is mostly like the mach 3 except with 2 blades.  contrary to what you have heard, the head is NOT much bigger than the mach 3.  in fact, the blades start from the top at the SAME point.  i didn\'t have trouble shaving under my nose or anywhere else.  the total blade area is slightly larger than the mach 3 which is a GOOD thing.  this + 5 blades = a faster shave.  add the battery \'power\' feature to this, and you\'re basically shaving with lightning!  you HAVE to try the power feature.  it\'s amazing.. it eliminates tugging.  it slices right through facial hair.  absolutely brilliant.  it\'s no gimmick, believe me.  also, the blades do NOT get more clogged, another lie.  in fact, these blades get LESS clogged than any razor i\'ve ever used.  one other thing - the single-blade trimmer on the back is far from \'useless.\'  it\'s incredibly useful and does exactly what you need.  it\'s innovative and an improvement over the mach 3.  so with all this brilliance, what could go wrong, you ask?razor burn.  the same problem i had with the mach 3!!  i would lift my cheek up and see little razor burn all along it, and get razor burn on one part of my neck.  that wasn\'t too bad, until around the 6th or 7th shave, when it suddenly tore up my neck with razor burn!!  now, you may say i used the blade too long.  however, there\'s no good way to tell when the razor is going to cause you problems.  the lubrication strip wears out too fast, on like the third shave but the blades are still sharp.  so i kept using it, still getting close fast shaves and one day it cut me up.the shave itself - the fusion definitely does give a closer shave than the mach 3, particularly if you use the power feature and a great shaving gel (in my case, king of shaves magna gel ARB formula).  however, it seems to get \'too\' close in a way.  my face would itch.  i\'d look in the mirror and see a kind of film over my skin, apparently skin that had been shaved off.  not cool!!  i would use the fusion if my skin could handle it..  maybe i will try using it without the power feature and see if that helps.  the power is so fast & fun to use that it\'s addictive.  but i\'m afraid i may be doomed to using razors older than the mach 3...

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is currently for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $9.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are 3 of them).  There are other offers through Amazon for this exact same item for up to $19.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!  Currently, this listing is the best price for this item, but it might not always be in the future."

I did not experience any of the slick and greasy feel that another reviewer talked about- however, I have felt this with other Venus blades, and I think this is mainly on the first use, and tends to lessen as the blade is used more.I think the Venus line is great- the handle is easy to hold, the blades easy to attach, and the whole product glides easily over skin.

My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.

Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up.

The best part of the ProGlide is that your can use your old Fusion handles to attach the blades onto.  No need to buy special ProGlide handles.

These toothbrushes also feature  electronics that keep the motor voltage constant - and hence maintain optimal orbital brushing speed - even as the battery voltage declines as they discharge. So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops. So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries! This feature also means despite the lower voltage of using 2x 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, you get the same brushing speed and power as using 2x 1.5V Alkaline cells. This is great! as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.Build quality of the units is great as you\'d expect for a Braun, even for a cheaper unit. The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section. This guarantees moisture vapour can\'t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term service.The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can\'t get into the internals.The 2-minute timer is a nice feature. At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing but if you wan\'t to keep brushing, you can as it doesnt turn the motor off.Overall this brush is great, especially for the price. The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific. The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber. All these problems are remedied with this Braun model."

There is nothing truly special about it. The scent is very \'right off the shelf of the drug-store\'. It smells like every other bottle of pantene to me, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing. It is what it is!The conditioner doesn\'t seem to phase my completely unruly, pin straight, fine yet dense hair. I have the strangest hair. Some days it feels very thick and voluminous and others it feels very flat and light. I want a conditioner that adds a nice density to my fine strands but doesn\'t cause my scalp to get oily after a few hours. This doesn\'t do the trick for me.I am also turned off by the fact that this is NOT sls free. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the cheapest method for a company to get it\'s product lathering or textured a certain way and it is literaly the same stuff they use in car wash soaps and degreasing chemicals for car engines. In the same way as it dissolves the grease on the car engines, sodium lauryl sulfate also dissolves the oils on your skin, which can cause a drying effect, which in turn might cause an overproduction of oils, as is my case. It is also well documented that it denatures skin proteins, which causes not only irritation, but also allows environmental contaminants easier access to the lower, sensitive layers of the skin.Products with SLS are not only dangerous for the skin but they can also effect a person\'s hormones and lead to various forms of cancer. So, in the long run, it is better to invest the five bucks you would pay for a tube of this stuff and get something that is CLEARLY marked SLS-FREE. That said, for those less conscious or interested in the harm that SLS can cause...this conditioner will probably be a staple in your shower. It smells fresh and does it\'s job OK for that everyday-pantene price.It\'s not something I would ever buy or endorse though. "

It is very easy not to brush your teeth long enough especially if you are in a hurry.

I finally decided that there must be something better and more effective.  After much research online and with my dentist\'s input, I decided on the Oral-B.  I absolutely love the deep cleaning feature and brush head.  Actually, I never use any other head or brushing strength other than the deep cleaning mode and brush head.  The brush head has numerous styles of bristles that accomplish different things from deep cleaning, removing plaque, cleaning between teeth, massaging gums, etc.  You couldn\'t give me my Philips Sonicare back.My original hesitance was the price.  But, it was worth the money considering I only have one set of teeth and gums.One minor CON:  The user manual was not written to be user friendly.  It does a poor job of explaining how to set the Smart Guide Clock features.  Just be prepared to read it carefully and keep it nearby for a few days.  When you consider all of the awesome features, the user manual is not worth losing a start or a half star."

Plus I accidentally left this off the pod and near water one day. The next day, the moisture strips were gooey and eroded.If I were going away and not expecting to have to shave my legs more than three times or so, this would be an excellent alternative to lugging along a shaving gel and razor.

It\'s more than just for patients with orthodontics as the description suggests.

I use about twice a week in addition to using the Precision Clean brush twice daily.

You could say it is a hybrid trac II.In my opinion, putting more blades on is a scam for you to buy more blades at a higher cost, keep in mind these are aluminium sharpened fine and coated for comfort, wrapped in plastic to attach at the head.Multi blades are going to last longer, common sense should tell you though, to put another 1-2-3 more blades in a razor shouldn\'t drive the cost up another $20.00 to $30.00.So as not to get off track, this razor system is great, the regular blades provide a close shave, the handle is at such an angle you can see those hard to get to places such as nose, sides, jawline.The sensor blades which are a little better, can provide a comfortable shave for people with more sensative skin, I find using barbasol with aloe or something comparable will give a close shave yet not have that burn afterward.My shave routine consists of:1.  cold water splash on the face, this tightens the pours of the skin and makes the whiskers stand up a little better.2.  I use barbasol regular, it\'s cheap, it\'s foam, and it does the job.3.  where you start is up to you, I usually start right to left going with the flow of the whiskers.  Never go against the grain as this will give you bumps (pseudofoliculitis barbae)and that can be a little uncomfortable or not look so good on that hot date or job interview.4.  after I shave i jump in the shower, however, if you don\'t always rinse.  This gets the cream off and any sediment such as left over whiskers and keeps them from entering skin pours and causing irritation, a big pimple or a serious infection.5.  Now, this is optional and I would recommend this for guys starting to shave.  Try some after shave lotion, it soothes the skin so you don\'t have that burn feeling all day, it also tightens the pours so you have a smooth shave longer and the girls appreciate a man that smells good and has a smooth face.i hope this helps some of you, pick what works for you.By the way gillette, I bet you are losing money on your blades, try lowering the prices for the everyday guy to afford to shave.

I plan to have my two young children use the brush, however, the brushes are identical, with no markings to distinguish them, so I marked one brush at the base with a permanent marker to indicate the difference.  The brushing action is robust and does a good job of scrubbing tooth surfaces.  There is no need for additional pressure or manual brush strokes.  The brush has a built-in timer and makes a stuttering sound after you have brushed for two minutes.  My kids enjoy the brush and don\'t find it overly harsh or difficult to use.  I was quite pleased with the results and feel it does a better job than relying on them to properly use the manual brush.  The two-minute timer also makes sure they brush for a sufficient duration.  We\'re approaching two weeks of use without a recharge.  That\'s pretty good battery life, considering it\'s used twice a day by two people.

They keep me drier than Ultrathins by somehow drawing the moisture away from me. With Ultrathins I feel dry. With these, I feel drier.

Not sure if the double wings are actually better than single wings, but wings are wings and they do protect the sides of the panties just like the Ultrathin with Wings do.The back of the overnight Infinity is longer and wider than the front of the pad for that leakage that seeps backwards. So far, I have not had any accidents. The Infinity regular size, of course, doesn\'t have this added length in the back. I find the regular size adequate for daytime protection.Always Infinity are the most absorbant pads I\'ve ever used. Don\'t know what technology they have, but he moisture is pulled away from me and locked inside. When I change them, I feel they could still absorb so much more.

I found the \'d\' shaped holders very difficult to manuever around the teeth. Other than that observation this product is terrible, with the floss popping off the holder every two or three teeth. Next to useless."

This product is nice and it can really make your smile bright. Using a manual brush can make your smile white, but this product makes it stay white no matter what foods you eat or what kinds of sodas you drink. Worth the money."

I have very fine hair, and I am not sure if this shampoo has made my strands any thicker, but it does get my hair clean without drying it out, and has a very nice, light scent. "

The replacement cartridges they are very very expensive. (of course Amazon has it on sale right now, but they are still too expensive).As far as the shaving experience goes, it is absolutely fabulous. It is extremely smooth and saves time while shaving. The lube strip seems to wear out faster than the Mach 3, but I could be mistaken there as I\'ve been using it for a a few days only now.Once a week I don\'t shave for a few days (weekends... one gets lazy) and the razor cuts through with ease, as if it were cutting through a days growth. Not only that, I used to have problems with hair getting stuck between the blades, whenever shaving after such an interval. with the Fusion it is not an issue. The hair washes off under the tap (means faucet for those who didn\'t understand \'tap\'), no struggling required.Expensive as it is (like other reviewers have observed as well), I\'m not going back to the Mach 3 that I used earlier. and certainly never to the Sensor excel I used before that. No regrets at all.definitely definitely recommended...    "

It was only when I sought out a remedy and came across studies linking SLS -- sodium lauryl sulfate -- as a major contributor to canker sore outbreaks that I discovered this amazing toothpaste. I have used this toothpaste since it came out on the market and my incidence of outbreaks has diminished nearly 100%. If I do happen to get an outbreak, which will happen if I do not brush at least three times per day, the intensity of the outbreak is significantly reduced and the amount of time the canker sore lasts is only a few days. If you suffer from canker sores to any degree BUY THIS TOOTHPASTE! You will never suffer again. I turned my aunt, my uncle and now my husband onto this toothpaste and they are now canker sore free as well."

After letting hair grow a day or two, it hurt to shave usually. But with these razors, I was highly surprised I could tell a difference. The thinner blade technology is very noticeable to be. I never get that \'tug and pull\' feeling. My only complaint is the lotioning strip thing. It tends to wear out before the blades do making it slightly uncomfortable to shave with. However these are still the best razors I\'ve used to date.Oh and having the \'power\' one that vibrates also gives me a better shave. I thought it was dumb to have a vibrating razor...until I tried it. Baby face with these :)    "

The lubrication \'wings\' get wet and they get, well, slimy. Not in a \'gross\' sort of way, but in a \'wow that really prevents cuts and abrasions\' sort of way. Still, they disappear pretty fast. I can only imagine if you were shaving something big like your legs that each cartridge would wear out pretty fast. But great while it lasts.    "
