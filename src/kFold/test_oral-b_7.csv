This was $30-$40 less than the cheapest one I could find in the stores.  There isn\'t much more to say, top notch product at best price.  Your pearly whites will thank you for this."
61,62,20030131,B00006ANDJ,4,"January 31, 2003",A29CUCGRX04TS8,Worth the price,"[This price] for three heads may seem pricey given what you can pick up three toothbrushes for, but the Braun electric toothbrush is really very effective, so for good dental hygiene it is worth getting.I like the colour rings provided in these sets, which allow multiple users to make use of a single electric toothbrush handle.  The heads go white with use to tell you when they are ready for replacement."
712,729,20100630,B0002M5JO8,5,"June 30, 2010",ALQ3QLLP30HLG,Great Results,"The dental hygienist commented that my teeth looked cleaner with less plaque than before and asked if I was using an electric toothbrush. I said yes and she told me to keep using it. Local convenience stores were selling replacement heads for $25, but Amazon sold them for a lot less. The shipment arrived quickly too."

It holds a charge for over a week which is great for travel.  It is very slim which is great for packing but a little hard to hold.  Repalcement heads are way way to expensive but that is true of most electric brushes."

I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  When we(hubby and I) use these brush heads it makes the teeth feel like we\'ve visited the hygenist !!
1658,1701,20110227,B001CX4JSS,4,"February 27, 2011",APLURHZA03MAJ,Good value for the money,"I would say that overall, it\'s a good to excellent value for the money. My only criticism is that I can\'t tell when the 2 minute timer goes off. It\'s supposed to stutter. I really can\'t tell if it\'s stuttering on its own or I\'ve hit the sensitive mode on accident."

Ive been using for 1 month and im pleased so far; very light and almost as small as regular toothbrush. The battery can last as long as week for now so its pretty good.

Well its hard to say, the packaging looks right and the brushes look right.The bristles feel wrong, they are supposed to be the same as the one in the stores, and yet they dont feel right, to dense or firm., just not like any of the Oral b heads I have ever used beforeThe heads come a little loose after just a few uses, and have pinched the inside of my mouth more than once or twice.Would I buy things again? NO!  They are cheap rip offs or lets just say a \'Bad batch\'.I guess the next thing to do is to contact amazon and complain about the seller, and to contact Oral B owners and send them these stating where and how purchased.In other words keep away from this seller, they either dont know what they are doing or a simply involved in fraud....."

They have the same name and look EXACTLY like they should. But when I attached one of them, I noticed that the fit was not right- it was on there, but it was way too loose. And that was after a good 5 min of hurting my fingers, trying to squeeze  the color ring onto the bottom of the head... I got it on there but not without difficulty. I am still using the head on my toothbrush... only because I can\'t afford another one right now. It came halfway off the base while brushing yesterday... and the piece with bristles is starting to detach from the stem.  Don\'t think it\'ll last much longer.  This product is an imposter!"

I\'ve been meaning to get one and finally got around to it.  My dentist really sings the praises of these types of toothbrushes.After using this Oral-b 3K for a few weeks I really like it so far.  The first few times using it were a bit jarring because it sort of feels like a jackhammer on my teeth.  But, my teeth feel much cleaner than regular brushing and it\'s easier to clean a few plaque-prone areas.My pros:  seems superior method to regular toothbrush, good handle size in my hand, good brush size in my mouth, holds a good battery charge, base has spots for extra heads for other family members, pressure sensor light works for me, timer is good.My cons:  my only con so far is that I don\'t like how the base charger cord is long...this sits on my bathroom vanity so has unsightly cord bunched...would like shorter cord or hide it in the base somehow.I can\'t speak to durability so far since only been using a few weeks...if anything notable happens I will update this post.  I have a dental cleaning in a few weeks so I\'m curious to see if my dentist notices anything different!"

I originally bought the cheap imitation brushes which do NOT work!  Such a big price difference, I thought it worth a try.  OK... the money was completely wasted on the cheap imitation brushes.  I hope this review will keep you from wasting YOUR time and money on the cheap imitations.  These brushes are expensive, but they\'re the Real Deal because they Work (spin)."

63,64,20120414,B00006ANDK,5,"April 14, 2012",A34E2DIWNBEJ19,Excellent,Best brush head I have ever used! It is small and circular in shape so that you can easily brush ever surface of each tooth. The bristles are the softest I\'ve seen on an electric toothbrush and will not wear away your teeth and gums if light pressure is used. The head moves in a spinning motion but does not make a full 360 but rather it rotates about 90 degrees to the left then back to the right. The bristles change color from blue to white as you use them to remind you when to change the bristles.
889,907,20110516,B000AUIFCA,3,"May 16, 2011",A20Z755BH8JGD,One of the heads did not spin.,I purchased an Oral B Floss action3 pack brush head refill pack and one of the heads did not rotate and could not be used.  I believe it was a manufacturing problem. I have been using Oral B for several years and never had a head not work before.

This new brush head works much better.  I noticed with the old brush head that my teeth felt much cleaner than when brushing with a old fashioned toothbrush.  These new heads are even a step above that.  The only draw back is they are much larger and are quite a mouthful.  But they work well so it is worth the trade off."

This does not replace flossing if thats what you\'re looking for but the rubber bristles are great for massaging your gums and improving circulation. Healthy gums = healthy teeth

While I had gotten used to just the small, round head (and my regular dental check-ups have been better since I began using it!), I think that this head does an even better job.  It still has the spinning round head, but next to it is a head that makes it more standard toothbrush shape and size that moves back and forth.  I feel like I\'m getting twice the cleaning every time I brush."

After a couple months of use, it has met all of my expectations.  I have definitely seen an overall improvement around the gum line (a problem area), and although I freely admit I could probably achieve the same results with more concentrated manual brushing, this brush makes it easy.  To early to comment on durabilty, etc. but battery life has been approx. a week between charges, which is nice.  The separate monitor is a nice feature, athough I admittedly use more as a clock than a monitor as to how long i\'ve brushed.  All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.  A quick word on the \'Frustration Free Packaging\'... it rocks!  Open a carbbord box and you\'re ready to plug in the charger and seat the handle."

769,786,20080815,B0002M5JO8,4,"August 15, 2008",A2SXBGLP56PDGK,sonic clean,This is a new product for me - takes some getting used to but was recommended by my hygenist
2187,2237,20110128,B002HWS9GG,4,"January 28, 2011",A2T7P7ZL7RLGB7,Good Product,"I am a first time electric toothbrush user.  But, according to my hygienist, I am a plaque producing maniac so it was suggested to me by her that I get one of these things.  The initial price shocked me but with the rebate, I could swallow spending a net of $50 on a toothbrush.  So far, I like it.  Not sure why anyone would \'need\' the little timer/clock thing that comes with it and I wouldn\'t suggest anyone spend extra money to have this feature. I have banished mine to a drawer as I do not have unlimited space in my bathroom. The toothbrush itself is a little bulky, but after a week or so, you get used to it. One of the features I do really love is the vibrate indicator.  After 30 seconds, it vibrates to tell you to move on to the next quadrant in your mouth.  What I am astounded by however (and kicking myself in the butt over) is the price of replacement heads.  I never thought to check on that before I bought this.  It costs about $25 for a 3 pack or about $12 for a single.  Also, I have yet to find a 3 pack that is a multi pack (i.e. different heads).  So, if you are like me, and use both the polishing and cleaning head, just using this toothbrush will cost about $9 every month to replace the heads.  As for how well it cleans...I am a smoker and a coffee drinker. I am also obsessed with clean teeth so I get mine cleaned by my hygienist every 3 months.  My teeth feel cleaner since using this toothbrush and if this toothbrush allows me to expand my dentist visits to every 6 months, the cost of the unit and replacement heads will be worth every penny (as I have to pay out of pocket for 2 cleanings a year b/c insurance only covers a cleaning every 6 months)If not, then I will be happy feeling as though I have cleaner teeth but will check this purchase off as a luxury and a \'want\', not a need. One other thing that I would like to point out is that, if, like me, you have limited bathroom space and outlets, this toothbrush is wonderful b/c you only have to charge it once a week. I was very concerned over where this unit was going to \'live\' as I need my bathroom plugs for my hairdryer and flat iron.  I do not leave the base sitting out and I do not constantly charge it. I keep the toothbrush in a drawer in the case (which is very nice) it comes with and simply charge it overnight every sunday."
116,117,20110810,B00006ANDK,3,"August 10, 2011",AGAKV3X5CXEKJ,Wouldn\'t buy again,"The brush head is too small. It takes too long to brush my teeth because there aren\'t enough bristles. I know that sounds stupid, but it\'s true."
2084,2132,20110617,B002HWS9GG,5,"June 17, 2011",AOB959CB30BXK,One of my BEST Purchases,"The first week was a little bit of a shock to my gums, but after that I couldn\'t believe I never used one before. It\'s so easy, you know if you\'re pressing too hard on your teeth/gums, you make sure to brush for the proper amount of time and who could resist the winking smiley on the wireless indicator?? AND it has induction charging, sooo coool."
1591,1632,20080917,B001CX4JSS,3,"September 17, 2008",A2RW587355CMVA,slightly inferior quality compared to its fullsize SonicCare cousin,"Sure, the economy is bad. Consumers are depressed and clenching tighter to their dollars. Companies need innovations in their products in order to stimulate more sales. I get it. However, simply miniaturizing a perfectly good product (like the full-size SonicCare) without adding more values is hardly worth anyone\'s time or money. What is more unnecessary is to sacrifice performance just to make something more, to quote another reviewer, \'aesthetically pleasing\'. When it comes to my dental health, thanks but no thanks, I will take performance any day over form. Compared to the other brushed I have used, this tiny brush definitely feels less effective. Don\'t get me wrong though, this is not a horrible brush. Had I never used any other electric toothbrushes before, I probably would be satisfied with this brush just fine. But after using/reviewing a number of different brushes from Vine program, I\'m used to that more powerful and super fast cleaning offered by the full-size models. In fact, I don\'t mind - and actually prefer - that slightly weightier feel of other brushes in my hand. Mind you, I do travel quite often, but the old brush fits my suitcase just fine."

808,825,20111105,B0002M5JO8,4,"November 5, 2011",A319B1KYVRG74I,Love Oral B,I have always liked the Oral B products and the sonic version of the toothbrush seems to me to work very well.  My only complaints about the toothbrush heads are that they wear fairly quickly (and you really need to replace it when the toothbursh head is worn) and they are pricey - very pricey in stores.  The Amazon deal I got makes the price much more palatable.
312,320,20080302,B00006ANDQ,5,"March 2, 2008",A1GV9ND49PO1BU,Best value,"Be sure to read the product description and get the heads that ship free from Amazon. It is a good idea to keep several replacement heads in stock to replace every 3 months or when the color begins to fade from the brush head. Excellent fresh, smooth, clean, polished feeling. Promotes healthier gum tissues without damage or encouraging recession."

Then we went back to manual toothbrushes for a while.  We realized that the manual toothbrushes didn\'t leave our mouths feeling as clean as the rechargeable toothbrushes, so we decided to purchase a Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.We purchased the Sonicare from Amazon and tried it for a couple weeks.  At first, we thought it did a very good job cleaning our teeth and gums, but it started feeling weak.  I\'m not sure if the toothbrush lost its full power after the first week, but the pulsating just didn\'t seem as good as our older Oral B.We returned it to Amazon as it seemed defective, and purchased the Oral B Professional Series 5000.  We\'ve used it for a few days now and it draws rings around the Sonicare.  The oscillating motion of the toothbrush alone leaves our teeth, gums, and overall mouth feeling much cleaner than anything we\'ve ever used; feels almost as good as a cleaning from the dentist.I highly recommend this toothbrush over the Sonicare.  Also, we are using the Oral B Floss brush heads.  They are tremendous and are much cheaper than the Sonicare brush heads as well."

1599,1640,20080904,B001CX4JSS,3,"September 4, 2008",AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU,"Good, but Oral B Triumph 9900 is Better","I used a Sonicare toothbrush for 2 years before switching to an Oral-B Triumph, so I\'m familiar with these types of sonic toothbrushes.The design of this Oral-B Pulsonic is quite nice.  I like that it\'s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison.  On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare.  And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general. (I also have their Pulsonic razor)  I also like the design of the charging unit and extra cleaning attachment as well.But as I said earlier, I switched from Sonicare to an Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.  And for me, comparing this Pulsonic to the Triumph... well, there\'s just no comparison.  The Triumph is better by far.  Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you\'re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.I\'ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it\'s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won\'t last long.  I can bring my Triumph on a 10 day vacation without the charging unit (and I brush twice a day.)  I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn\'t have a big enough battery to do that.  And even if it does, that just goes to show you the cleaning power.  This one is subtle, and good if you have sensitive teeth and gums.So if you want a good, deep clean, buy the Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide."

They are impossible to find locally anymore.In addition they don\'t fit the oral B handle as well as the originals, they are probably meant as a one size fits all arrangement, which they don\'t.

I feel like my teeth are a lot cleaner (although I\'m not a dentist so I can\'t be sure.)This was easy to figure out and easy to use. It\'s comfortable once you get used to it.The only downside is more for people who aren\'t used to electric toothbrushes- my gums were actually a bit sore for about a week after trying this at first.

The brush itself is a different size and shape than the smaller round heads I presently use, so that was another reason I was looking forward to using these. The cut out shape in the stem of the brush attachment is entirely different than that of the brush I have on there now, and so it does not snap onto the brush handle at all.  I don\'t know if Oral B/Braun has changed the brush design since other reviewers\' comments, so just beware that this refill will likely NOT fit your vitality sonic. Bummed :("
1518,1554,20090907,B001CX4JSS,2,"September 7, 2009",A2DG63DN704LOI,"Questionable benefits, too many shortcomings.","Here\'s my experience with the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.Pros:In comparison to other electric/sonic toothbrushes I\'ve owned in the past, it\'s much smaller. At first I didn\'t like the size (read: I wasn\'t used to it), but after brushing with it for a weeks, I realize that I like it better because I can be more precise with my brushing (like with a regular toothbrush)The charger has a small footprint, so it doesn\'t take up too much counter space. It is  also understated so it doesn\'t draw attention to itself.Cons:The attachments (brush, floss brush) can come off or loosen during brushing. If you brush in a wrist-twisting motion like me, you\'ll have to change your brushing style or the tops will keep coming off.It only comes with one brush head. This means that unless you\'re a bachelor, you\'ll need to buy additional heads. I haven\'t looked up the price to these, but that\'s definitely something to consider.There is no cover for the brush heads. This can\'t be too sanitary - especially in a bathroom (dust, hairspray, hand-washing splashes, toilet mist, etc)Final opinion:While I do think this could be a good-value alternative to the costlier sonic toothbrush models, ultimately it\'s hard to say if this unit cleans much better than a manual toothbrush. I still end up brushing my teeth like I did with a regular toothbrush  - the only difference being that this one is vibrating as I go.With questionable benefits and so many shortcomings, I cannot recomend this product."

The Oral-B power toothbrush easily cleans the hard-to-reach areas of your teeth, removing more plaque than an ordinary toothbrush. Users will see a clear difference within the first few brushings.One thing to note, however, is that this toothbrush has a fairly long cord. So, depending on your bathroom sink area and outlet setup, you may run into the same problem I did, of the cord crossing the entire sink and getting in the way of the other things on the surface.

The floss heads are a little rough along the gums, sometimes causing a bit of bleeding if too much pressure and time is put to the gum areas. One simply has to be careful to not over-brush the gum line and all will be well with the rest of the mouth.The one star out of the five I took away for this review is because the brush has the problem with irritating gums, everything else is fine.The charging base is convenient, and the feel of the brush is solid.I recommend this product as a budget brush.

Now to the point...- Quality of the cleaning - My first impression is that the feeling it leaves after you use the brush is slick and clean.  Im usually the type to brush when I can and I do religiously.  I feel this product does the job well and faster than using a manual toothbrush.- Charge - The charge last pretty much exactly what it says.  Depending how often you use it (I use mine twice-morning and night) It lasts about 10-14 days.- Timer -The quadrant timer is something that is useful as well.  I like how it \'paces\' you through the brushing.  There are times when my mind wanders and with this it gives a little pause in the vibrations to prompt you to go to the next quadrant in your mouth.- Durability -Its been about 5 or 6 months since I\'ve purchased it and it doesnt seem to have any durability issues.  When spending any more money for a high dollar item this is a concern for me.- Sound - The sound is a little bit louder than the Sonicare, but it wasn\'t a big concern for me.Overall, it was a choice between this and the Sonicare line, and I went with this after lots of research.  I like how this comes with a nice travel case so for the trips it is easy to store.  Many of the Sonicare products that is in the same price range did not.  Also the replacement heads for the brush are cheaper with the Oral B (more options to pick also)and it might not be a big deal to everyone, but I\'m sure the cost all adds up after years of use.  With all that aside, I\'m very happy with the product, because of the quality of cleaning. It says 2 minutes for a total clean, but I go the 2 minutes plus an extra 45-60 seconds and I get a better clean than manually brushing for 5 minutes plus.  I never had a \'break in\' time to have my gums adjust, which some people might need, but it was fine and gentle enough for me.  Ill never go back to manual toothbrushes again."

The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.  I bought this second one in 9/2010 while Amazon & OralB had a 50% off rebate so ended up paying only $25 for it - a definite buy at that price!

Healthy for the gums.It was really amazing. It felt incredibly clean and especially clear of foreign materials. I am a flosser by nature as well..and I noticed after several days of usage...that my flossing showed less and less particles between my teeth. And those particles came out easier - even popcorn!What\'s really nice is it comes with and extra brush - either for use with two peeople or use one as your back up and it plugs into the wall nicely. There is no battery replacement however because it is magnetically charged the hand unit does not plug intothe wall. Free from cord or plug issues being close to water.It was packed well and comes complete with operational instructions as well as infomation on how to brush properly with it.

My favorite brush is now free and easy without need of a charging stand. This product is exactly what I expected and wanted, so I have no complaints. And the price is just a steal!Just a word about brush heads. There are various options for Oral-B, but basically two main ones: Precision Clean and Dual Clean. Precision Clean only has the round group of bristles at the tip of the brush. The correct way to use this brush head is to run it slowly over each tooth. This cleans very thoroughly. For people who aren\'t comfortable changing the technique they\'re accustomed to with non-powered toothbrushes, there is the Dual Clean.

Amazon.com was listed as a vendor who supported the offer, which was to include a rebate for the 50% discount.  The toothbrush arrived, and I am very pleased with it.  However, I didn\'t receive the rebate certificate.  I sent a message to customer service at Amazon.com asking for the rebate slip or an explanation as to why it was not included.  I received no response, and that was about a month ago.As for the toothbrush, it is more powerful than the model I was using previously (also Oral-B) and appears to be more effective.  I liked my old Oral-B but this one is even better.As for Amazon, I am very disappointed.  In future, I will refrain from purchasing items from Amazon that are offered under a rebate.  The 50% discount was a significant amount of money that I lost by purchasing through Amazon instead of going to another location on Oral-B\'s list (e.g., Best Buy)."

It tells you when to move to each quadrant of your mouth and also when you are done, it vibrates thrice so you don\'t have to look at the screen.

In fact, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.  For regular toothbrush users, the difference is huge.  I could never go back to a regular brush.However, I have a huge gripe with people who post products for a ridiculously cheap price only to essentially double the cost with shipping.  In this case, $16 for the heads and $11 to ship them.  I can\'t imagine from their weight, that they cost anymore than $2-$3 to ship, so how someone justifies the extra $9 is beyond me.Bottom line is that this is a fantastic product that I have been extremely happy with, but the seller\'s price is (in my opinion) misleading at best and probably could be more accurately described as downright dishonest."

It does not use a lot of space in your bathroom.When I first used this power toothbrush it felt somewhat large, but then quickly it felt comfortable. I have been using an ultrasonic toothbrush for some time now with great results so far. What i really liked about this one is that you feel the head much more on your teeth and you feel the movement, so you end up with a feeling of having really clean mouth which I like much more than the ultrasonic.Another advantage for this one is that there are different types of heads for different uses, and they are considerably less expensive than the replacement heads for ultrasonic toothbrushes (which are almost as expensive as this brush is). I have been using my power brush for about two months, alternating with the ultrasonic, and it has worked perfectly.Overall, a pretty good power brush. For the price, this is an unbeatable value."

Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  The icing on the cake is the low price of this brush. Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  This is an excellent product. 4.5 Stars*** Positive Points: ***- Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)- Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3). The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).- It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base. You simply stick the raised portion of the charger into the end of the brush.- Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries- Brush vibrates to let you know when you have gone over the recommended 2 minute brush time.- 2 year warranty*** Negative Points: ***- Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.- There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.- The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouthOverall:  This toothbrush cannot be beat for its price.  I deducted half a star because there is no indicator light telling you the battery status, though this is a minor issue."

I am very happy to have it.- It takes 2 AA rechargeable batteries. A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks. (it depends on how long your batteries hold the charge). Alkaline batteries last a month. So it is very useful for traveling.- Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken. Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.- If you want to save the environment and you don\'t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans then you don\'t like toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries. It is very hard to remove the batteries from the unit to handle them properly.- This is the least expensive electric toothbrush from Oral-B. But it performs really well.- This toothbrush uses the same refill brushes that other expensive models use. So you get similar result for much less money.Con:- This one does not have a timer. You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.- People reported that this toothbrush lasts from 1 to 2 years. Well, the most expensive (about 9 times more expensive) Oral-B electric toothbrush lasts from 3 to 5 years. If you do not care about other features the expensive ones offers, I think this has more value."

Sometimes they lasted a while, but like other people have said they felt loose.  Then one by one, they would break, sometimes even while in my mouth.  I honestly thought it was just something wrong with my toothbruth.  I figured it was just a little off and causing damage to the heads.  So this weekend I began to look into buying a new toothbruth when I came across all the articles about the fake brushheads.  Sure enough, the descriptions of the fake merchandise matched what I had.  So I\'ve been using fake heads for a year.  I contacted Amazon and after 30 minutes and having to speak to the manager they refunded only the ones bought directly from Amazon.  They said since I had purchased them so long ago this was a \'special exception\' they were making for me.  I don\'t even really care about the money so much as I care about taking responsibility for it.  Amazon should be at least somewhere responsible for the quality of their products and even of the resellers.  Refunding or contacting the reseller is the least they can do in my opinion.  The manager has forwarded my story to the inventory department and if I receive a call back I will update here.  Thanks everyone.Update: I haven\'t heard yet from Amazon, but I called Oral B.  They took this much more seriously.  At Amazon I got the feeling they thought I was scamming them, but Oral B took all my information, refunded me, and is looking into it.  Like I said I didn\'t really care about the money, but rather that I\'ve been using fake brushheads for a year and the fact that it still seems like Amazon is selling them.  Who knows if I was damaging my teeth...."

323,331,20050310,B00006ANDQ,5,"March 10, 2005",A2WXIJTI5PEV9N,How Something So Basic Can Be Fun,"This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It\'s kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

The stupid timer thing is a waste of plastic and will probably end up in the trash.  It\'s useless and not a smart solution.  It waste battery and it\'s bulky.  Sonicare brushes just beeps and stops for a split second to tell you to move to the next quadrant (it\'s built into the toothbrush).  Also, this thing seems to just rotate and didn\'t do too well between the gap of your tooth.  With sonicare, it just sorta melts it was or the bubbles extract the stuff out.If you insist on this type of brush, buy the 4000 version...even if the 5000 is cheaper (which is not)...because it\'ll save having to buy batteries or waste the planet\'s resource.Again, I hate waste, stupid design, gimmicks.I want to see someone else support me on this.

I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I\'m lucky enough to have a window and sill.For that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don\'t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life. And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all. The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical. But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again. I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).In my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months. Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don\'t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B."

I\'ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them. They were loud, heavy and large in the hand. I was hesitant to try a power toothbrush again, but my dentist suggested it was time to cave and get another. So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush. It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud. I especially like the additional small brush head that comes with it. The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth. The small size of the brush is also great for travel. For short trips I just pack the toothbrush with a regular brushhead cover. For longer trips, I throw in the base and the brush. The base is not too large, so it is not a huge annoyance to pack. My one complaint (and thus the 4 stars) would be that it does not come with a travel case.

I am able to eat with relative abandon again (after getting braces) once I learned how to use the SmartSeries 5000 properly and in a systematic way.The SmartSeries 5000 (with an ortho brush head and power tip attachment) has made brushing and cleaning with braces on extremely easy and a no-brainer.The kit includes a handy travel case (with holders for two attachments), lightweight charger, and timer which links wirelessly to the toothbrush.I usually start with the power tip which is very effective in cleaning debris around brackets and between the wires.  To clean with the ortho brush head, simply press it in front of each tooth and count slowly to twelve -- going from the rear molars to the front teeth on each side on both top and bottom rows of teeth. After that, just brush the biting surfaces and rear of the teeth.Overall, the kit components were very useful to me except for the timer.The timer would display a ring which represented the top and bottom rows of teeth.  The ring was split into four sections and the timer would indicate the amount of time needed for each quadrant of teeth.  It was somewhat tricky to clean by the quadrant and just easier for me to use a fixed count for each tooth."

I bought the toothbrush for my husband as a gift since his dental hygienist had recommended he use one and suggested the Oral-B (he drinks a lot of coffee).  I also bought another Oral-B Professional Care model for myself but without the clock or toothbrush holder as I didn\'t have the room on the shelf where I keep the electric toothbrush in another bathroom, and am just as pleased with it.  However, had I bought the same model, I read in the directions that there was a step necessary so one unit would not interfere with the other if they were too close to each other.  I\'m contemplating buying a third electric toothbrush to keep in my second home (my husband will probably take his with him, but mine doesn\'t have a traveling case, and with all I take back and forth, it\'s just as easy to keep one in each place).  I will add that I like the Oral-B better than the Sonicare I use there.

I use all 3 different brush heads provided, but mainly stick to one speed, the daily cleaning.  I use the unit set on \'airplane\' mode, as a wireless display of where I am at what time in my mouth is just silly, a waste of a battery, and needless exposure to rf waves to boot.  One other downside is that the charger is in the plug, which sticks out @ 3 1/2 inches from the outlet, not a good look for a small bathroom counter.So, in future I will look for a non-Smart model and will remain perfectly stupid and happy with it.

The first thing that I noticed is that the blue color is darker.  Then the coefficient of friction moving from one tooth to the next tooth is much higher.  Probably what happened is that the fake brush has cut bristles and the real thing has rounded bristles.  Finally, the most obvious tell is that you can easily scratch the logo off the counterfeit item with your fingernail but the real item has a completely glazed surface.I have been buying these Floss Action brushes for about 3 years (since they first came out) and I replace them every month, so I\'ve bought a lot of them.

1950,1995,20111102,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 2, 2011",AGSC327PXS3W6,Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 - High end dental care,"The last of my 3 Sonicare Advantage electric toothbrush handles died about 2 weeks ago. I got the idea to try to replace the battery but the case has no easy way of opening and my attempt resulted in a shattered case -- it went in my batteries-to-be-recycled bag. I have an Oral-B Vitality I got cheap for under $20 over a year ago because I like to have more than one electric toothbrush (big house). However, it\'s action seemed primitive to me compared to my Sonicares, so I started shopping. Costco has a current coupon on a pair of Sonicares but I decided to look online and see what I could find out and/or buy.I decided on the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 in spite of the fact that there appears to be no rebate available for it at this time. The reasons I decided on the 5000 are several. Firstly, it appears to be not difficult to replace the battery when the time comes. The replacement batteries are easily found on ebay and several of those listings (and other YouTube videos) feature  detailed instructions on how to do the replacement. You do have to use a solder iron, but I\'ve been handy with one since I was a teenager, so no big deal. I would not buy another Sonicare if I thought it might not be possible to replace the battery.Why get the best Oral-B going in spite of the price? I am a frugal guy, extremely so, but in this instance I figure it\'s time to splurge. I have only one set of teeth. The dentist does not scare me, nor the oral surgeon, but I know that the bills can come to literally thousands of dollars. If I obsess a little on my oral hygiene, so much the better! My wallet, teeth, breathe and smile will all benefit! Oh, and my general health. Oral health is a very important part of one\'s overall health.I discovered that the extra brushes I bought for my Oral-B Vitality will work fine with my 5000, cool!The Smart Guide? Well, it\'s OK, it\'s a plus, but no biggie. The biggest advantage of it is if you use more than one mode. It shows you which brushing mode you are using, and it is possible to be in a mode you didn\'t know you were in unless you glance at the Smart Guide. This happened once to me already. I hadn\'t intended to use other than the default mode, but I\'d inadvertently pressed the mode advance button.When I got the 5000, it had no charge and I set it in the charging cradle but nothing happened and I thought maybe the battery was bad. I\'d looked at the instructions on charging but hadn\'t read down to the short paragraph where it says that the battery icon on the handle\'s LCD may not appear for 10-15 minutes the first time you charge it. I still hadn\'t seen that part of the instructions when I got the idea to place the handle in the charging cradle of my Sonicare brush, thinking the Oral-B\'s might be inoperative. Just a second or two in that cradle gave the battery enough oomph to show the battery icon, I then charged it fully in the Oral-B\'s cradle and everything\'s been fine since.The Sonicares I had would pulse briefly every 30 seconds and turn off after 2 minutes. The Oral-B does the every-30-second pulsing, but keeps on going when the 2 minutes is up. I like the fact that the Oral-B keeps on going and lets me decide when I want to turn it off.I picked up mine off ebay for about $12 less than the lowest price I\'ve seen here. The price here has varied by about $10 (i.e. 10%) just over the last week. If I were in no hurry I\'d have waited for another 50% off rebate offer, however.You have to insert the brush in your mouth before turning it on so as not to spray toothpaste all over.  Likewise, you have to turn it off before removing it from your mouth. After doing that, I place it under running tap water, and while holding it under the stream of water I turn on the brush for a few seconds and let it clean itself of toothpaste, then turn off the tap leaving the brush running for a few more seconds to let it shake off most of the water so it will dry quickly.I\'ve always brushed before flossing. I always use a dental pick as well (strongly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist, it\'s the end of a round toothpick, held in a handle called the \'perio-aid 3\', given me by my dentist). A couple of days ago I started wondering if I should really brush first and did an Internet search on the subject and found out that brushing is recommended to come last because dislodging plaque from the tooth/gum-line gives your fluoride toothpaste access to the tooth surfaces, re-mineralizing those surfaces, making them more resistant to decay. So, now I\'m brushing last."

There is a real deal breaker here.The Good: When compared to my Sonicare, this brand actually works better at removing plaque, and I really, really like the little pick brush. It gets into tight areas and along the gum line if you need it to.The Bad: There are problems with this product though. Even on the \'sensitive\' setting, the brushing can be a bit harsh. If it didn\'t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it\'s not. I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation. This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing. Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes. Yes, this one is supposed to beep, but my didn\'t always do that.The Ugly: Then there\'s the deal breaker - the handle is so small and it vibrates so intensely in my hand that it is painful to use on a daily basis. I have carpal tunnel on the right and an old stress fracture on the left, so even though this products does what it is supposed to do very well, I will continue to use my larger grip, smoother running Sonicare on  a regular basis and this product only once in  awhile for a \'spit polish.\' I would not recommend this product for anyone with large hands, previous or current hand injury or nerve damage, or any one with arthritis."

It doesn\'t last as long between charges (approximately 1/2 as long, 5 days instead of 10 days), and you\'ll need to be careful about letting it discharge once in a while because of the memory effect of NiCd batteries.It also lacks a lot of the frills of the other toothbrush. No LED light to indicating charging / charge full, and it does not pulse at 30 second intervals when brushing. It does pulse at the end of 2 minutes though.The brushing action is also different from the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush. The brushing action feels weaker, though I must admit the teeth feels just as clean afterwards. I tried the same toothbrush head on them - they appear to be interchangeable. I\'ve also tried the original toothbrush head. I can\'t judge effectiveness (they appear to all clean well) but the one that came with the \'Professional Care\' toothbrush feels more comfortable to me - better contact with the teeth.This toothbrush is significantly lighter, but otherwise the construction looks to be about the same level as the other one.I\'m giving it 4 stars despite the shortcomings because it is significantly cheaper than the other toothbrush. I think they balance each other out (I\'d rate my existing toothbrush 4 stars as well).For me at least, an electric toothbrush cleans teeth much better than manual brushing and although I\'m definitely not a dentist, I recommend them."

I thought that was way better than our manual toothbrushes, but thought I\'d give this a whirl.  It makes a HUGE difference!  For one, the head is much smaller than the SpinBrush.  It\'s just one rotating head, whereas the SpinBrush has a rotating head and another section that goes up and down.  While I thought the rotation wouldn\'t leave my mouth feeling as clean as the double-motion head of the SpinBrush, it actually felt better!  Perhaps the smaller head allows it to get to more places in my mouth, or perhaps it is that the rotation looks, sounds, and feels much faster.  The SpinBrush is battery powered and even with new batteries, I don\'t think the top head spun as fast as this bad boy.  While this toothbrush costs more than the SprinBrush, it\'s still relatively inexpensive and since you can replace the heads, it\'s still a good option for those who don\'t want to spend top dollar on an electric toothbrush.  Overall, I love this toothbrush.  We will see how it stands up over time, but for the week I\'ve been using it, I feel like my mouth is cleaner."

It is a very nice design and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because it doesn\'t sit firmly in the base and is easy to knock it out of the base, it wobbles when bumped lightly. I also feel the brush head could be slightly smaller but the size is OK, I just like the smaller brush heads. It says the charge will last for about 4 hours which is good since brushing teeth only takes about 2 minutes. This is a very nice pulsing toothbrush for a little less money than some that works well. (there is a card inside that says about a survey and a $10 prepaid as a reward but this must be an older box, the survey can not be found)"

I prefer the vibrating timer instead of a beep.  Supposedly most of the other oral-b heads are interchangeable, but I haven\'t tried that yet.  The floss action heads that came with this model may be a littler harsh for some, but don\'t bother me.  But, I do plan on trying some different heads for comparison.

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it\'s kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

I\'ve been a fan of oral B products ever since I was 18. I first bought the regular manual toothbrush and wasn\'t satisfied. I then bought the oral B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush, used it for about a month, and stopped. From then on I stayed using the man�al brush and was silent for about 3 years. This year I decided to give Oral B P.C. 5000 a shot. BOY o BOY, I cannot believe I didn\'t get this one earlier! When I first got it and after I took it out of the box, it was kinda confusing setting it up, and i� takes time getting used to it, but give it about 2 days you should have no problem. The Smart Monitor keeps you well-focused on which area you should brush. The brush heads that came with it are nice too. Mine came with the pro whitening heads and floss �ction. I\'m buying precission clean head soon. Overall it\'s easy to set up just give a little patience.

Since I began using this toothbrush my teeth have never felt cleaner.  It is used just like a manual toothbrush, but it cleans teeth much better.  The price was reasonable too and Oral-B was offering a $15.00 rebate when I purchased it so that made the deal even sweeter.  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who likes to brush his or her teeth the old fashioned way but with a serious power boost.  I have very sensitive gums and teeth and the sensitive setting is perfect...there is little to no irritation.  If you are looking for a reasonable priced rechargeable toothbrush this is the toothbrush for you.  Happy brushing!"

Just a week ago (Feb 16, 2012) the battery had gone dead on it. I was pretty happy considering it lasted over 6 years. Granted it was a little more expensive than the 5000, I still expect this SmartSeries to perform as good if not better. When reading the manual on this toothbrush I seen the section on the battery in it. It gave instructions on what to do if and when the battery goes dead on it. I tried to perform the procedure on my old Sonicare since they have the same basic structure. I couldn\'t seem to open the bottom of it and any suggestions would be great. However, I don\'t even know if the battery on that model is even replaceable. When I first turned on the SmartSeries 5000 I noticed a BIG difference that my old Sonicare. The sound was extremely different. The Sonicare had a tight buzzing sound that sounded very well built. The 5000 had more of a loose buzz. It is a bit louder and makes me question if its going to last half the time my old toothbrush did. Who knows, maybe this is a new addition that cleans your teeth better or maybe I\'m just so used to my old one that I question anything different. The Smart Guide system on this brush is pretty cool. If you have kids, it will definitely make them want to brush. There\'s a smiley face that gets bigger and bigger the longer your brush. You can stick the Smart Guide screen onto a mirror or the wall. The toothbrush also has a monitor in it that lets you know if you\'re brushing too hard. There is a red light that is very noticeable on the handle that lights up when your pushing too hard. It is compatible with 5 different brush heads that supposedly do different things. I don\'t know if this is just a selling point or what but I find it pretty handy. Overall, there is not much difference in the 1000, 1500, 3000, or 5000. Just a couple additions the higher the number but the basic stuff is going to be there with all of them. If I had to do it over I would have gotten a cheaper one. I thought getting the biggest and best one would have more advantages. It\'s still a good buy and I have no complaints as of yet."

While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  My last toothbrush had a tiny LED screen built into the brush that displayed battery life.  However, after about a year, this screen shorted out and became useless. The unit eventually just gave out and I had to replace it.I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard. I wish I actually had this feature years ago because I was brushing too hard and scrubbed away much of my enamel.It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  There are better brushes for you gums.  However, if I could give half stars, I would give this unit a 4.5/5 star rating.Oral-B was also running a promo at the time; if you buy an qualifying unit, you can receive an 50% mail in rebate.  So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  So for $40, this is a great brush.  This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard no matter which unit/brand you buy. I also like that it takes up a small amount of space on my countertop; I wish the power cord was detachable for easier storage though - not a big deal however.All in all, it is a good brush.  It is a straightforward unit that has just the right amount of features without paying an arm and a leg."

The winner for me is Oral B Essentials. Very smooth - perfectly thin. Gets between the teeth with no trouble at all. Quick to do the whole mouth. Never cuts my gums. The floss can shred a little bit, but no worse than any other I\'ve tried, I won\'t bother deducting points for that.

Then again, other dentists have said they\'re nothing special, and careful brushing using a regular toothbrush is just fine. Anyway, I certainly can\'t seen any harm in trying one and after just a few days of use so far, I\'m already beginning to think it was a worthwhile decision.The Oral-B 3000 is easy to use, feels reasonably solid in hand, and is simple to keep clean (it\'s nice that the brush can be removed quickly to rinse out). I was a little nervous the first time I tried it, expecting bleeding gums or soreness, but in fact the opposite has been true. Because there\'s no need to scrub hard, it\'s actually quite gentle, though the sensation is a little strange at first and it took me a few tries to get used to it. I felt it was really getting my gum-line clean, and because they recommend just two minutes (30 seconds per \'quadrant\') I was actually more aware than I usually am with a regular toothbrush about reaching every corner of my mouth and teeth... I guess with no \'instructions\' and years of just using a normal toothbrush, it\'s sometimes easy to forget what we learned as children when it comes to brushing our teeth!So, I\'m happy so far. My mouth and teeth have never felt so clean immediately after brushing (note, that \'clean\' feeling of course quickly disappears once you eat again), though the way the device vibrates against my jaw is a little perturbing, but I\'ll just have to get used to that. I\'d have liked to have seen a few more brush heads supplied with the product as I feel those will get expensive. I noticed the Oral-B site mentions this product coming with four different brushes, but the package states that we only get the one. There appear to be a variety of different brushes available, but I\'m not sure how useful they all are... I\'ll probably stick to just the original one as it already does a better job than a regular brush at polishing my teeth, and I\'m not sure how well the other ones would work. There is one brush with two heads though, that could be interesting to try and might clean even better. Fortunately, these replacement heads are not horribly expensive online, despite being considerably more than a normal toothbrush and lasting about as long. Still, it\'s a small price to pay for that \'clean teeth\' feel, I think."

My sonicare now sits in the closet and I use this brush exclusively.

I\'ve had a Sonicare for years and I thought nothing could compare. I was wrong -- this one works great. I received the head that has floss action and I\'m planning to try a couple of the others. That\'s one big advantage of the Oral B -- you can buy different heads to use for different purposes. The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.My only complaint is that there\'s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it\'s fully charged or when the charge is low. It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors. When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working. Now I\'m never sure when to recharge -- although it seems like you can go a long time (a week or so?) between charges."

I don\'t know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price.  They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That\'s a real laugh.  Even brushing just once a day, you\'re lucky if you get a month out of them.  So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with."
3034,3120,20110424,B003XDZ66E,5,"April 24, 2011",A1SCQYLCP16AK3,The only floss I will use,I\'ve been using this floss since it came out - once I tried it I wasn\'t interested in trying anything else.  My teeth are really close together so I have trouble using a lot of other types of floss and there is no way I could ever use the rounded type or the unwaxed stuff.  The price here is similar to what you can find it on sale for at your local store but I always forget to buy it when I\'m out so this four pack is convenient.  My only caution is to make sure you\'re buying the right kind - there is \'satin floss\' and \'satin tape\'... the packages look almost identical but I do not like the \'satin tape\' at all.  That is one mistake you can easily make at the store that you can avoid here!

2729,2800,20110829,B003UKKHB4,5,"August 29, 2011",A1E1NVQ002ZPDG,Amazing!,"I had 17 cavities, this tooth brush literally made them all go away in 2 weeks! Ok not really but it is a sweet little tooth brush. I love that it\'s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue you can put it on soft mode. The charger you see in the picture can actually come apart so you are left with a tiny stand if you want instead of the big face. The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist saying \'you\'re brushing your teeth too hard\' which can be very bad for you. Finally the cost. You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning. My mouth was a little sore but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \'I bet you haven\'t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\' I actually told him that wasn\'t true...I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing. My teeth feel the same as going to a dentist (plus I floss twice a day), every day..what more can you ask for.Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes... you get what you pay for period. People my age find this expensive, but the investment again is just a win-win that pays for itself right away. Did I mention is also really does help whiten teeth with the special head? yeah that\'s awesome also!...oh and the charge really does last all week"

I bought this toothbrush after my Sonicare fell on the floor and never worked the same. I have been using a Crest Spinbrush since my Sonicare broke, which I hated. I have been using the Pulsonic for a few weeks now. This toothbrush is amazing! It is so light and slim, and I love the smaller brush attachment for the back teeth and in between teeth. When I am done my teeth feel so clean, like I just had them polished at the dentist! So far I like this toothbrush way more than the Sonicare, which was too heavy, the brush head was too large for my liking, and when you take it out of your mouth to spit, you (and the mirror) get splattered. That doesn\'t happen with the Pulsonic. Plus, you can\'t beat the price for the Pulsonic. My boyfriend is getting annoyed with me because every time I use it I tell him how much I love it. HaHa! I highly recommend it, try it for yourself, I promise you won\'t be disappointed."

2975,3056,20101113,B003UKR67M,2,"November 13, 2010",A13700AF4X40YG,Small Step Up from Manual Toothbrush,"I got this toothbrush thinking it might be a less expensive alternative to the more expensive sonic toothbrushes that I\'ve been using.  While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I\'m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn\'t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don\'t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I\'d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I\'ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I\'m not a dental health professional, so I don\'t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn\'t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it\'s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can\'t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I\'m afraid I don\'t care for it enough to do even that).If you\'re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I\'ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn\'t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums."
