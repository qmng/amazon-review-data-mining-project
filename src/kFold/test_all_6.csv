6465,229,233,20100611,B003JA3KDW,4,"June 11, 2010",AE88D7OM7YU99,Probably best for SUPER curly hair,"I recently had my hair cut substantially. Removing the weight caused the natural wave to turn into curls...at least I considered them curls.  Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair conditioner has a great scent and my hair was incredibly soft and silky after using it.  I have a frizz issue and that was taken care of as well.  So, what was the problem?  My \'curls\' were relaxed so much that they were for the most part non-existant.  Pantene warns you should only buy this product if you have curly hair, so it was really my bad for miscategorizing my hair as curly.  If you have tightly curled hair, I think you will be very pleased with this product.  It is not right for someone with wavy hair if they want to keep their waves. "

I finally decided it was time to get a new set of razors.  I saw these and thought it was a good deal as it was the cheapest price I could find.When I started using my razors, I noticed immediately that I was not getting the close and comfortable shave I had with my older razor.  I thought maybe one out of my box of 12 might have been dull, so I tried another razor.  Unfortunately, that one had the same problem.These razors work, but they could be better.  They wear out much faster than I expected and they don\'t give me the close shave I want, but they sell at a decent price.  I think next time, though, I will just accept the $50 price tag and buy them from Costco.    "

I have to say that I am thankful I didn\'t pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I\'ve ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for \'precision\' is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can\'t be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o\'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What\'s next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle? Perhaps reshape your jaw bone to give you that \'Executive Look\' ?    "

It took one try to conclude it was totally useless for my purposes.  I have a full beard that is cropped fairly close to the chin line.  I found the Fusion Pro Glide razor head too thick and bulky to perform any type of precision shaving at the edge lines.  Coupled with the trimmer as a handle, it was extremely awkward to use.  I attempted to use the battery operated trimmer along the lip line underneath my moustache and got nothing.  The trimmer is not sharp enough and does not get close enough to cut anything.  Trying to trim the rest of my beard with the snap on combs was an exercise in futility.  The trimmer head is too small and the 3 combs do not provide enough flexibility in terms of hair length.  All in all, I found this product to be a total waste of money.  The best part was the Duracell battery which I removed before throwing the rest in the trash.  Do yourself a favor and don\'t get taken in by s slick marketing campaign designed to sell overpriced razor heads.  If Gillette had spent as much money on the product as they did on the packaging it might be a different story.  There are a number of small rechargeable beard/moustache trimmers in the same price range that out perform this product and a variety of disposable razors that offer more precise shaving.  I\'d rather have a couple of products that perform well instead of one that does not.    "

Closer shave than the Mach 3, and less irritation under the neck.  Here\'s a tip that will save you much money.  I used to get only about 2 weeks works of shaves on the Mach 3.  Years ago, I read an article in Fortune magazine that you can extend the life of a blade by spraying the product \'Clean Shower\' (by Arm and Hammer) after each use.  As a result, I now get 2 months of shaves per blade on both the Mach 3 and now the Fusion.  Really helps since the cost of Fusion blades are so high.    "

I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal. Fushion is quite a bit better. I was surprised. I like the reverse side feature of one blade for under the nose.

The Green Tea scent is very \'spa-like\' and feminine.  The blade contours all the nooks and crannies of my body wonderfully and there wasn\'t one nick at all.  Over the years I have been a loyal follower of the \'Intuition\' razor and \'Veet\' line.  I don\'t like buying shaving cream seperately and find that the cream clogs the razor from doing its job after all.  The downfall of the \'Intuition\' was that the head was rather clunky at about an inch height and the soap part would wear down rather quickly.The Venus has a soft pink head that is actually very gel-like in feeling.  I used it to shave my legs, under arms and bikini area and haven\'t seen any wear on the jelly heads that surround the blades.  The actual handle feels great in my hand; especially the little spot on the head where I place my finger to control the pressure that I apply whilst shaving.  Very thoughtful product that was truly tested.  My one only complaint at the time is that shaved hair gets caught underneath the jelly sides.  I have to manually go and remove all the hair each time.... which is rather annoying.You get two head cartridges with that delightful scent and case that will hold the cartridges and handle.  You can even hang it with the \'stickies\' supplied.  I haven\'t tried the \'stickies\' because from past experience they either fall or they stick to the tile forever while the product is on the floor.  I wish companies would jump on the suction cup back like the \'Intuition\' provides.Highly recommend the product because I did not have one nick or any bumps after shaving.  Very smooth, close shave for a sensitive skin user here!    "

My thoughtswere confirmed when I broke all four heads within about 3 monthsof using them.  The small rotating piece on the back of the headbroke off while brushing.  I somehow found the first three but, unfortunately swallowed the forth today. The small piece makes thebrush head rotate in a uniform patten.  When it breaks you can stilluse the toothbrush but, with lesses results; what\'s the point in that?If your order packaging looks old and worn, the plastic is old also causing premature aging of the plastic heads making them brittle.  Pleasebe aware of this issue.  BTW, I don\'t brush hard either!  Hope this helps."

My teeth feel cleaner than ever before (sounds cheesy, but its true!). Here\'s what I think after having used this product for just about 2 weeks:1. The design is very simple. The battery enclosure is rubberized, stays water proof and the whole toothbrush feels sound and well made. It came with Duracell batteries which was a pleasant surprise.2. The cleaning action is fantastic. My gums are quite sensitive but this toothbrush has really gentle bristles that don\'t hurt my gums at all.3. I love the awesome 2-minute timer that lets you know that you\'ve been brushing for 2 minutes with a slightly different \'vibration\' pattern.4. Strangely, I\'ve been brushing my teeth 3 times a day since I got this brush!Overall, I have absolutely no complaints. I love this toothbrush and its a phenomenal buy for the price. Amazon rocks as usual. I noticed that replacement heads are a little expensive but really worth it (make sure they\'re from a reputable seller due to fakes on the market). I\'ll be sticking with the Oral-B Precision Clean line for life.UPDATE 8/18/11: After almost 6 months of use, this little guy is still going strong!

I loved it and kept it sharp by rubbing the blade with an alcohol prep pad and storing it *outside* the bathroom to make it last longer. It worked, too!I always buy a pack of cheap disposables for summer travel: to my parents\' house, to his parents\' house, on vacation, everywhere. I ran out of the Schick Quattro disposables so I figured I\'d try something new. My brother\'s girlfriend is half Mexican so she has SUPER thick hair - she told me to try the Custom Plus Pivots out.Wow. What a razor! For 1/3 or 1/2 the cost of a Mach 3 blade you get an ultra sharp, durable and long lasting razor. The moisturizing strip is HUGE!I can\'t believe these are so great. I will say that for bikini line usage I still slightly prefer the Mach 3 because it can pivot more than these do. These are great for legs, armpits and face.Overall a steal!    "

But, I digress...  Can\'t tell first hand if it\'s a good deodorant because I\'ve never been challenged in that area.  Some times nature works in your favor.  My impression is that it would do a good job at that too.The only downside was the smell.  Personally, I like it.  However, we also need to consider my wife.  If she were a character on Heroes, her power would be a super sense of smell.  It\'s both sensitive and sophisticated.

The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.  I bought this second one in 9/2010 while Amazon & OralB had a 50% off rebate so ended up paying only $25 for it - a definite buy at that price!

I have an electric toothbrush that still charges fully and functions as new 10 years later! I say the same for their shavers.  This filter, ever after YOU break it WILL deliver the same coffee taste/strength.  Beyond durability, this filter\'s appeal also stems from the size of the holes in their mesh, which as mentioned in numerous other reviews, will give you an extra 8oz cup of coffee over paper.  Tip, if you want it to last 5 years or more, remove it and clean it soon after making your coffee, at the latest, when you have finished all the coffee in the carafe.  DO NOT bang it against anything to remove the old grind and DO NOT leave the hot soggy grind in the filter for any length of time, and NO dishwasher!  To prevent the oil build-up on the mesh, simply rinse with cool water outside-in ASAP, and place upside down in natural lit area so as to prevent mold. As mentioned before, the mesh even without the plastic support frame or gold finish will deliver the quality coffee taste as when new and outlive all your coffee makers and your taste buds too!"

While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.ADVANTAGES:Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It\'s not the most powerful brush I\'ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.DISADVANTAGES:Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it\'s nice to have the option and this one does not.Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it\'s power would rate 3 stars.OTHER COMMENTS:Does it whiten teeth?  It\'s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.  I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me."

And when I finally ran out, I had to borrow my moms other thins pads (not the infinity) and I only used it for two days and it irritated me again. So if you have that problem, get these. The really really absorb and are exremely soft! Its like magic. I dont see how its possible that it can absorb so much but it does!"

Here\'s my take on Pantene\'s Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions:PROS:This is a nice conditioner that truly works without adding extra weight. Many conditioners flatten my hair with extra weight, so I\'m happy to find a conditioner that works without this problem.CONS:I cannot tell any difference in the volume of my hair (I\'ve used the product only twice).  Admittedly, my hair may not be as fine as the manufacturer intends, so I may not be the best test subject for this product.OVERALL:I will continue to use this conditioner because it avoids the problem of extra weight. The added volume may (or may not) kick in after more usage.  Should that happen, I will update this review.Four stars. "

I examined every part of the toothbrush to see where it could have come from, and eventually rinsed out this tiny little hole towards the top of the toothbrush (which I had never noticed or thought about before) and found, to my horror, that it was absolutely filled with disgusting mold. You know those scenes in lowbrow comedies where a character finds out that they\'ve eaten something disgusting, and desperately try to clean out their mouth until they feel better? Yeah, the scene that followed was kind of like that.Maybe I missed something in the instructional booklet (and I DID read it,) but I had no idea I should be on the look-out for mold in such a random place in my toothbrush. A Google search has shown me that a lot of people have the same problem, and they fix it using things like bleach, hotel towels (\'Because it\'s too revolting to even use my own towels on it\') and an independently-created product that attempts to seal the stupid little hole.Personally, I\'m not going to use a hygiene product that can cause way more harm than good.

3596,423,431,20050817,B0000C4KJV,4,"August 17, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one\'s teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.2.  Waxed floss is \'waxed\' to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don\'t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.6.

The handle is much larger than I like on a toothbrush, and the base should be regularly cleaned for sanitary reasons as well. However, this is a powerful little toothbrush - at least it gives you the impression you are really getting your teeth cleaned. The extra head it comes with is a plus too, and the timer helps, though if you have a big mouth like mine, you may need more than 2 minutes to brush. I have almost always used less expensive electric tooth brushes, and this is among the best I have tried before."

My hair is very long, and wavy, and I notice a definite increase in waves and smoothness when I use it.  It makes my hair feel just very....fresh.I do find, that about every 5th shampoo, that if I use a different brand, then return to the Pantene, that it works even better, but this Pantene is my mainstay.  The only conditioner I like a bit better is the older salon brand: TIGI Bedhead, but it\'s 4-5 times this cost.  I\'ve been using this Pantene since it came out, even before Vine offered it to me.  It\'s really minimized split ends and breakage as well - a problem with hair as long as mine is.  Highly recommend! "

The handle has a nice weight and grip that makes it easy to maneuver.The fact that the heads are packaged in plastic and foil make it easy to keep a spare one in the shower.  I\'m forever forgetting to change it long after the blades have gone dull.  The extra packaging while nice for my forgetfulness does not appear to be recyclable and therefore just some extra waste.The \'Shower Pod\' is a nice idea since many newer razors are too wide for most razor holders. -- Now if I can convince it to stay stuck to the side of the shower I\'d be even happier.Overall a great razor.

Once I got over the shock of the gigantic sized cartridge, I was okay.What comes in the package:  One handle, one cartridge and a suction holder (which didn\'t stay suctioned anywhere in my bathroom).The handle: Is smooshy and has a soft gel-like grip.  I loved this.  It doesn\'t slip around in the shower and fits nicely in my hand.The cartridge: Did I mention this was huge?  I was trying to find a common object to compare it to.  I ended up using money. The cartridge is almost as wide as two quarters.  There is still portions on left uncovered above the quarters. The razor itself has 5 blades-nice.  On either side of the blade is an Olay bar-which is what makes this so huge.  I\'m assuming these will shrink with use.The shave: I was not brave enough to use this without soap on my legs.  I usually just squeeze shower cream into a bath puff and lather my legs. So, I don\'t use a thick lather...just enough to help the razor glide and not give me razor burn.  I did notice that there was an improved smoothness to the shave.  Even with my usual shower cream, there was not a big lather. For me, this is a plus. For others, the lack of shaving cream/gel thickness may take some getting used to.The shave was close. My skin was smooth afterwards.  It even did well under my arms.  Now, if you were to use this anywhere between your underarms and your legs, there may be issues since the cartridge is gigantic. This is a bummer.The cartridge refills run about five dollars each.  A bit pricy but if you are no longer buying shaving cream, the cost evens out.  The plus is that you can use the refills on any Venus handle (per the product description of the replacement cartridges).  However, this handle is better than the Venus handles I\'ve used in the past, but if you have a handle...it\'s nice to know you\'re not being forced to buy a new one. Brownie points for Gillette.The front of the package has a sticker guarantee that states \'Love it or 2x money back\'.  My final thought for this review is: If I would have paid for this product, would I take advantage of the guarantee?  My answer is no.  Although the size of the cartridge is what is keeping me from giving this 5 stars, the bars on the cartridge are superior to the nasty little sticky moisturizing strips on other razors.  The shave was good.  If purchased on sale, it would be an excellent buy.I will update my review to note how long the bars last on the one cartridge that I have (shaving every other day...down from my previous daily OCD shave).

My father and I both adopted the philips sonicare system. I got this for my mom who has some sensitive gums that the sonicare irritated when she tried my dad\'s unit.  She is satisfied with the oral-b design.Over the sonicare, this has a smaller brush-head which can get into smaller places easier.Unlike the original oral b brushes, this is rechargable which is a major plus when you get halfway through brushing and the batteries suddenly die.Personally, my preference is for the sonicare system as it really cleans well, but even my father has tried this and thinks it might be doing a better job than the sonicare.Time will tell and I\'ll update my review with new info as the checkups come in.  Since we had used the AA battery verion before, we had extra brush-heads to all try the unit which is good in a family environment.  I think we felt the purchase price of the sonicare alot more since I don\'t live at home and had to buy my own.  I think the pricepoint oral b managed to hit at 1/4 the price of the sonicare system is a very affordable way for people to add a powered brush to their oral hygene."

If you want to use the trimmer to do some edging, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. It\'s not powerful enough to do edging. It works fine trimming with each of the combs, but edging is out. My 20 year old Con-air trimmer does better due to more power (2 AA batteries as opposed to 1 AA battery for the styler). And the replacement cartridges prices are insane, although you can get the 6 cartridge replacement from Amazon for cheaper than you can a 4 cartridge replacement at any store.

It brushes much more thoroughly.On the downside, it is a bit louder (not a big deal) and the RPM drops noticeably as the days go by until I recharge it.

I will admit that I don\'t use the advanced features that the 5000 has over the lower models.  The massaging and other brushing modes don\'t impress me; I just use the regular mode.  (I used to use the soft mode on the Sonic Complete, but I don\'t have a problem with the aggressiveness of the regular mode in the 5000).

The single side is great for edging your side burns and those tricky hairs in-between you eye brows (not a full on unibrow).The shave is close, comfortable and smooth.

I found the best value on Amazon by BelowCostJML. They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&H for my whole shipment. (I ordered 5x the item of 6 brushes/ea, so 3 bucks S&H for 30 brush heads).Other sellers came somewhat close in pricing but wanted $7-10 S&H fees, not to mention that some would limit you to 1 item (of 3 brushes)/order. So if I wanted to increase the quantity to get the 30 brush heads I got from BelowCostJML, I would have to literally place the order 10 times and pay the ludicrous S&H cost 10x!I\'m thankful for BelowCostJML\'s fair pricing, including S&H and for their great service! The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time. Very pleased with the service!The product speaks for itself, I\'ve been a satisfied user for 8 years and I personally find it gentler in the mouth than Sonicare [I\'ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque (it\'s just a matter of each individual\'s preference)... I guess the \'difference\' would be equivalent to Pepsi versus Coke if you will (not that I\'m encouraging regular consumption of either): they give you the same overall effect, it just depends which one you prefer best. Hope this helped. Happy brushing (and don\'t forget to floss, too). :-)"

Cynics of course would find it hard to eulogise over what was obviously just another fad and a rip off.  10 years later the Mach 3 is still VERY highly regarded and widely used even with the coming of the might Fusion Power with a whole two more blades and a built in vibrator to pleasure you even further.I thought I\'d experiment with the Quattro a few years back and I thought it was an improvement on the Mach 3.  I just liked the way it felt and shaved although it didn\'t shave any better than the Mach 3.  I did have one irritation though as it clogged up quite often and it was hard to get clean.  I even used scrubbing brushes to clear it, not always successfully.  I must have liked the razor though as I didn\'t toss it.My Dad was over on holiday and had forgotten his electric razor and was forced to buy a razor.  He happened to get the Fusion Power and he laughed about the five blades and vibrator.  He was soon mightily impressed with it though.  I haven\'t found out though whether he has continued to use it or not.A month ago after the blades for my Quattro were done, I decided to buy this Fusion Power.  I did read the review which were split on whether it shaved any better but everyone, almost, who used it liked it.I bought it and wasn\'t disppointed.  It is a lovely razor to use and the vibrator is novel.I then bought a brand new Mach 3 to compare this Fusion Power with.  I showered then lathered up and did half my face with each one then looked closely.  The shave was pretty much the same for both sides but bear in mind that the blade on the Fusion was a month old!  Mind you both sides felt very smooth although on closer inspection this wasn\'t the case.  It just proved to me that my technique may be a bit average and that you can\'t shave the hairs to the surface of the skin (unlike the simulations you see on TV).I have to say though that the Fusion is one hell of a razor.  It looks so cool and the tactile feel and shape is a big improvement over the Mach 3.  Shaving itself feels much the same though.  I don\'t have a challenging growth though, it is pretty average and I think the most important thing to get a good shave is to shower first.  After a shower you can almost get away with no shaving cream , that\'s how big a difference it makes.Overall in spite of the blades being twice the price almost, I love the fusion.  Gillette have made a product that is a perfect synthesis of engineering genius and marketing passion to produce a truly wonderful prodcut.I hate them of course as they have tempted me to buy a product that is objectively, no better than the Mach 3 but in the final analysis the sex appeal of this fine razor won me over.

However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion.

Reading reviews also gave the Oral-B floss action brush head a slight edge, and I\'m inclined to agree; though it certainly doesn\'t replace regular flossing, so far it seems to be keeping the staining abated.The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist\'s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. Primarily, the mode switch is a source of frustration, for the brush can not be shut off without going through all three modes. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000."

First thing he noticed was that he had to turn the wheel (pushing the product upward) many many times to get it to reach the surface where it could be used.  Therefore, it is obvious that the container is not completely full, and therefore the user is actually getting less product than the size of the container would imply.  The directions say \'three clicks.\'  Yeah, right.  That may be true after the first use, but certainly not true for the initial use.  Also, the name of the anti-perspirant includes the words \'advanced solid,\' but the stuff that exuded from the little holes in the top sure looks like a thick cream.Other than that, all he could say about the product is that it seems to be a perfectly adequate anti-perspirant.  Even though he is a very active guy, he was neither negatively nor positively impressed.

There\'s no special technique, it\'s easy to clean, and it\'s disinclined to cut you. It doesn\'t feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I\'m using the same handle, and I\'ve since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can\'t feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don\'t reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won\'t fare as well. I\'ve bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.I\'ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it\'s difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it\'s been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge. Nitpicking, really.A safety razor would probably give you a closer cut, but if shaving is something you dispense with rather than an event to relish, the Mach 3 is where it\'s at.    "

Ironically, the Fusion is particularly bad at the two things it is advertised as being particularly good at: close, comfortable shaving, and shaving hard-to-reach places.The blades are terrible.  Right out of the box, the blades caught on my beard and made it painful to shave.  It felt as if the razor was very dull.  I switched blades after two shaves and the replacement was just as bad.  Comparitively, the Mach 3 blades feel great for as many as 10 uses for me.  Not comfortable at all, and because of the pain, I couldn\'t shave as close.As for using this razor to shave hard to reach areas, they must be kidding!  Compare the size of the Mach 3 with the Fusion.  If the Mach 3 is a tight-cornering sports car, the Fusion is a school bus.  To accomodate the five blades the razor pad is so large it\'s difficult to share accurately. And the \'trim\' blade on the back is simply dangerous - the placement makes it much more likely to cut your fiinger, but the plastic on either end of the blade itself makes it unlikely to shave your beard.Not worth the money.  The blades arms race should end now and these guys should focus on sharper, harder, razor blades and simpler razor design.    "

I\'d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it\'s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you\'re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.I have one implant, and some \'erosions\' on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it\'s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.Don\'t throw away that manual toothbrush, though.  There is still one mouth maintenance chore that the Oral-b does not handle well -- brushing of your tongue.  The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \'tooth\' brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  If you check my other reviews, you\'ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed."

Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use. Why the three stars and not just one? It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip brush.I have both a Oral-B Triumph and a Sonicare (can\'t remember the model number), and find both to be excellent performers. They are different, and each has its strengths/weaknesses, so I alternate between the two. The one shortcoming neither address well is getting between teeth to get out tea and coffee stains (and the occasional cigarette). For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside. My 6-month dental cleaning/checkup gets rid of them, but by month 4 or 5, they\'re back.Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it\'s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains. The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great. After brushing with either the Triumph or Sonicare, I finish with a 30-60 second run using the Precision Tip. Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth using.For everything else, the Pulsonic is a so-so performer at best. Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I\'ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.If you\'re looking to stop or get rid of in-between teeth stains, get this model and use it in combination with another model. If in-between teeth stains are not an issue, don\'t even bother with this. Pick up a different Oral-B or a Sonicare -- you\'ll be a lot happier with it than the Pulsonic."

It seems to be my experience that, if I blow-dry my hair completely after conditioning with this product, the hair looks somewhat smooth, but full and light at the same time (not weighed down). However, if you\'d like some \'defined curls,\' you might want to air-dry your hair a little rather than blow-drying it completely.

I even tried going off the stuff after a week and the symptoms returned.  Since then I keep a couple of gallons around all the time.  If I forget to use it my body lets me know in 3 or 4 days and I go back on it.  I only have to drink 1 or 2 ounces a day.These people who are saying this is water or that it doesn\'t work are suspect as far as I am concerned.  Do they work for the competition?  Do they have a beef with George\'s?  Did they take it correctly?  What else are they taking or eating and drinking?  Do they think the FDA would let George\'s get away with selling water?  You know how much the FDA would love to put the supplement business out of business!  They have tried hard enough.I know it works and I have recommended it to many others who are happy drinkers of George\'s Aloe Vera juice now.  Too bad I can\'t give it 6 stars.  This is a small price to pay for so many benefits."

The sealed box came with one FlossAction brush head.The handle I received says, \'TRIUMPH Professional Care\' and has the green charge lights on a gray background. It is NOT the digital display. My first guess is that this is the older model but some reviewers said they called Oral-B and were told the handles with a non-digital display (like mine) are the newest model, so I\'m not sure. I\'m also not sure if there are any improvements with a newer model - other than the display - that would make me want to be sure and have the newer model? I noticed that Amazon sales of the 4000 model are temporarily on hold while they investigate what appears to be the same issue.For now, I am happy and content with what I have. If anyone knows or learns more about this issue please let us know! The toothbrush seems excellent!Update: After reading through the model 5000 reviews going back to 2009, I now think that mine is a newer model afterall. Originally, they came with a 110/220 volt power adapter with the electronics built into the AC plug which made the plug that goes into the AC outlet overly large (some reviewers complained about the large plug). Mine has just a small basic 2-prong AC plug. Mine is 110 volt only and the electronics are in the charging base where the brush handle sits. Older units came with 2 or 3 brush heads. Mine came with only 1. So, it appears that Oral-B decided to cut some costs by removing the dual voltage and 1 or 2 extra brush heads. They also decided to change the LCD handle display to LED. Hopefully, they also added some improvements?! I\'m still happy."
936,516,526,20091012,B000BUUVTE,5,"October 12, 2009",A3OYO3Z2CHIHFS,Pinnacle of Manual Shaving,What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It\'s now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it\'s thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers   so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can\'t be improved.  It\'s just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

1474,1054,1083,20080415,B000XVSNTQ,3,"April 15, 2008",A2HXE29CU1I24Y,A few good improvements...until next year\'s replacement.,"Gillette has once again upped the ante by switching from a 3-blade shaving system and jumped to 5 blades since the competitor has brought to market their \'quattro\' version.I\'m surprised that after producing a powered razor in the form of Gillette Venus Vibrance, they have opted to go back to basics in a non-powered model that we now see as the Gillette Venus Embrace.  And despite being non-battery operated the price of both products has remained the same.PROS:1. The rubber grip on this new model is top of the line.  There is a \'gel\' quality feel to it that creates a soft cushion to the fingers, but still maintaining a nice solid grip.2. The shaving head is a size XL!  This means even more moisture content to help protect and smoothen the skin while shaving.3. The in-shower storage has been redesigned from the all=time rectangular shape of previoius Gillette razors and formed into a pod shape which Gillette now calls a \'ShowerPod\'.  The modern design is visually appealing and should enhance the bathrooms.Another good thing is that there are two suction cups behind the pods to create an easy install process.  This is a great move away from the old stick tape which can be placed once only with no chance for relocation should you decide you stuck it to a bad portion.  With the ShowerPods, you don\'t need to overthink your location which gives freedom to shift or hide the razor as you please.4. FIVE (5) Blades.  This is a matter of debate.  I welcome more blades to help reduce having to go over the same area and refrain from skin irritation.  More blades also means the hair has more chances of being cut even deeper has the blades pass over the area.  But I am quite disappointed as well with the quality of the blades (which brings me to the cons...)CONS:1. FIVE (5) THIN blades.  Compare the quality of the blades from the old Gilette Venus razors to this new 5-blade system and you will see what they have become.  It seems Gillette has every intention to help consumers keep on replacing the blades more often than before.  The blades are so thin that they loose sharpness faster than ever making you wonder and evaluate how much you should really be spending on this aspect of personal grooming.Of course I welcome more blades in a shaving system to create a smoother shave.  To achieve such characteristic is to have the blades spaced very closely together.  By choosing to do this, you risk loosing other customers that have a thicker hair folicle since a smaller gap means the hair doesn\'t pass thru between the blades and ends up getting stuck.  In the process, the shaving system fails to work as intended and resulting to nicks and cuts.The solution is to frequently run the blades and shake it in a container of water (or running water if you don\'t have the heart to save water at this day and age) in order to loosen and remove any shaved hair that may have piled up in the shaving head.2. EXPENSIVE.  Sure buying a new shaving system is relatively cheap.  But if you still haven\'t learned from the PRINTER/INK CARTRIDGE market, you should watch out for the price of replacement heads especially for newly introduced technology like this.3. MARKET LIFE.  As with Gillette products and marketing, they always have something up their sleeve.  So I wouldn\'t be surprised if they have a powered version ready for market release or a simple change of color depending on the theme of the times.  So you invest in a pack of replacement heads from your local wholesale warehouse and  before you know it, you are marketted another revolutionary shaving idea.4. COLOR/DESIGN.  The color is really wonderful and in time for Spring, but displaying it with your white ShowerPod may not fit all bathrooms.  Yes, it\'s a shaver but it still is built to be displayed within easy reach at the shower for convenience.  But give us a more neutral color like WHITE!  In fact make an ALL WHITE SHAVER and call it the GILLETTE VENUS ANGEL.  Together with the ShowerPod, that should be a better option for most bathroooms.CONCLUSION:Yes, the Venus Embrace is great.  You have created a five blade system and beat the competition once again.  The gel handle is the highlight of this release together with a very big shave head to help create an even smoother experience.However...What I would really like consumers to experience is a better shaving system with a head that lasts longer.  With all the manufacturing techniques, why not create blades that are not only sharper, but also maintains the sharpness.  This should be more convenient than having to stack up tons of replacement blades in the bathroom.  Make use of stronger and lighter materials like Schick\'s use of TITANIUM.  How about go seal the deal in technology and create a PORCELAIN-coated BLADE.  Anything as long as you can give us an idea that you also care for us to save.  In turn, we will create the illusion that we will also be loyal to the brand until the day we die.I still have a problem with the close spacing of the blades creating clogged hair in between them.  The idea of more blades will create cutting shaving time may not hold true since you will have to do more steps in loosening the hair particles in water.Overall, this is another winner in shaving experience.  But it\'s what we would expect from a manufacturer who wants to introduce better technology and ensure a steady replacement of expensive shave heads.    "

At first I didn\'t like the size (read: I wasn\'t used to it), but after brushing with it for a weeks, I realize that I like it better because I can be more precise with my brushing (like with a regular toothbrush)The charger has a small footprint, so it doesn\'t take up too much counter space. It is  also understated so it doesn\'t draw attention to itself.Cons:The attachments (brush, floss brush) can come off or loosen during brushing. If you brush in a wrist-twisting motion like me, you\'ll have to change your brushing style or the tops will keep coming off.It only comes with one brush head. This means that unless you\'re a bachelor, you\'ll need to buy additional heads. I haven\'t looked up the price to these, but that\'s definitely something to consider.There is no cover for the brush heads. This can\'t be too sanitary - especially in a bathroom (dust, hairspray, hand-washing splashes, toilet mist, etc)Final opinion:While I do think this could be a good-value alternative to the costlier sonic toothbrush models, ultimately it\'s hard to say if this unit cleans much better than a manual toothbrush. I still end up brushing my teeth like I did with a regular toothbrush  - the only difference being that this one is vibrating as I go.With questionable benefits and so many shortcomings, I cannot recomend this product."

I do think that they proglide may be sharper and give a better shave for the first 1-3 shaves but then they seem the same.  I also think the proglide did not last quite as long but can\'t be sure.  I usually got 2 weeks from the regular but only got about 10 days with the proglide.  Reason I can\'t be sure is I skipped shaving and it had to deal with a 2 day growth twice and that may have \'shortened\' the use.  I just wish I could find a razor that was more economical.  I had gone electric but suffered from irritation and when you figure the purchase plus the 2x a year blade replacement (yes electrics need blade replacement too) the cost came out the same.  When the 5 blade razor first appeared a news story did a comparision with the 3 blade.  There was no noticeable difference in the quality of shave that the review panel could feel.  I may go back to the Mach 3 or try a Schick product.  I have always used Gillette razors.  I would give a 4 for quality but knock it down to a 3 because of cost.

The Sensor Excel is really the best. The problem is it got so expensive, in a large part because the 5 blade razors were hugely expensive and Gillette/P&G couldn\'t have an old product that worked so well so much cheaper.  At least with Amazon\'s auto ship it makes the blades reasonable.  Perhaps the crowd at P&G are responsible for these ridiculous new models out now with 6 blades (5 for the face and 1 for under the nose).

I\'ve used the Fusions before and while they\'re great, I don\'t get the sense that that extra blade is really doing a lot.Some people seem to shave daily with no issues, but some of us aren\'t so lucky. That\'s where the Mach3 razors really shine - the shave is close, but gives the least amount of irritation of any razor I\'ve used. If you have problems with your razors leaving your face feeling raw, you can do all sorts of stuff (better shaving cream, soaking your face in hot water, etc.), but at the end of the day, it all comes down to your razor.

And the Oral-B brushing part of the two types of brush included in the box does a better cleaning job. Finally, we have battery disposal. The Sonicare has a non-removable Ni-Cad battery, so that in order to dispose of it properly at a recycling center I had to cut the base to access the battery.

Just got off the phone with Amazon no problem getting refund and getting free shipping label to send back. Yet will never buy razor blades from any store online again. Dont have the time to do the research if they are knock offs or no I just know from my experience with the ones from Amazon that they are way to sharp and cut up my neck and face even though I first wet my face with hot water then wait a couple minutes for shaving cream to settle into skin and shave the exact way I always do which never caused cuts with the blades I buy locally. Who knows whats up I will stick to buying my razor blades from the local retailers.Update: I contacted Amazon about this product. I hate to do this but because these are fakes I told them they will be shipped to Proctor and Gamble\'s counterfeit department for inspection. The reason I am doing this is because first of all the fake blades I received give a painful shave and I just cant allow fellow buyers to be deceived the way I was. So hopefully Amazon will either sell real ones or Procter and Gamble will peruse legal action. The bottom line is buyers like myself would gladly pay the couple extra dollars you would at Wal Mart rather then be deceived and being sold fake blades. And yes Amazon did refund my money but the procedure when you receive a counterfeit product is not to return it to the merchant first you should contact the company who makes the actual product then local and state attorney departments and the better business beuero.

But now I\'m glad I switched.I only shave every other day, and rarely on weekends, so sometimes I\'ll go 3 or 4 days without shaving. And the Fusion does a great job with the extra growth. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the \'comfort guard\' helps make it a smooth cut. And the power part is a big help; once I\'m done, it\'s a closer shave than the Mach III was. I also have a goatee, and the main blade of the Fusion can actually trim the edges.There are only 2 minor negatives to the Fusion: Cleaning out the comfort guard is a bit of a hassle, and the blue guard makes it hard to see any hair (mine is dark brown) that\'s been caught in it; and the battery indicator is basically useless. It\'s been \'low\' for several weeks, and a brand new battery didn\'t make a difference. So I guess when the razor stops working I\'ll know the battery is dead.Overall, a good step up from a simple razor.Update (11/17/07): It seems I misunderstood the battery indicator, which I apparently didn\'t look at very closely when I bought the razor. I thought the battery symbol on the razor would indicate when the battery was low, and that\'s why I thought it was \'low\' for so long; I didn\'t realize that it was like that all the time! The entire area around the battery symbol and the power button will actually flash orange when the battery is low, as I discovered this week. So I apologize to anyone that might have read my review and was misinformed because of it. And now the only minor negative about the razor is still the issue of cleaning the comfort guard.On the positive side, however, it seems the Fusion will last quite a while on one battery: Mine was still going strong in April when I originally posted this review -- and I had had the razor for some time then -- and despite the fact that I don\'t shave every day, the original battery (which I put back in after a new one didn\'t matter) lasted until now.

They\'re amazing.,"I logged on here last night because amazon customers always have the best reviews, and I needed pad advice. I too have fibroids and a major bleeding problem - clots, which are very hard to absorb.  I have to sleep with a towel under me and try to discreetly sit on a folder at work if I go to a meeting, it\'s so embarrassing.  Also with the fibroids and polycystic ovaries I have a questionable cycle and will skip months then bleed for weeks at a time (yes I know I need to just have the surgery lol).  I needed the pads stat so I bought them locally and woke up several times with no leaks for the first time in 10 or so years. I feel like today I can run errands without worrying about my tan leather interior, restaraunt chairs or spotting.  This is major, especially for a person who has had a month long period.  The amazon pricing with super saver shipping offers is a much better deal than my local store so I will be back here to buy in bulk.  I also bought the Always overnight super sonic maxi based on reviews and will try that out and leave a review.Thank you Always, thank you Amazon, and thank you reviewers!**UPDATE**  Back on here to buy more of this product, at a better price than my local store.  Still love them and have referred several friends who were also heavy period sufferers.  We all love them.  Also, try the overnight extra heavy flow with wings!  This pad must be at least 14\' long, great for my needs and especially plus size women.  The overnight feels a tad diaper-ish to wear by day, but still works if you need it.  The fit is great on both, I don\'t experience as much bunching and they stay in place. So glad to have my stress level reduced related to spotting and I don\'t have to wear black clothes every day!"

Amazon claims that \'The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\'  But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush. The toothbrush does work, however. I have two identical Oral-B 3D excel toothbrushes purchased on 8/20/01.  To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  I run the battery down to zero on the one I\'m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it\'s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle itself.Some reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that\'s hard to imagine:  there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  It\'s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it. It\'s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better."

For years (since about age 15 - I\'m 42 now) I\'ve found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it\'s simply a \'clean\' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don\'t find it competing with my perfume and haven\'t noticed it to be overpowering.Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.The product isn\'t invisible and will get on your clothes if you\'re not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.

I\'m very pleased with the results so far.  It provides more lift and stylability than I\'ve achieved with other shampoos. My hair is looking better than it has in a while. Since my hair isn\'t oily, I was a little concerned that the extra lift is reportedly achieved by removing oil from the hair. My hair doesn\'t look or feel dry after use, but still I thought I should add the companion conditioner just to be safe.  So far am pleased with it too.  Most conditioners make my hair hopelessly flat, but this product works well with the shampoo and doesn\'t counteract the shampoo\'s benefits.After using this shampoo, my scalp, which tends to be itchy, also feels good.  Since I use a lot of hair spray, I wonder if it is more effective at removing that residue from my scalp than other shampoos.  Don\'t know, but I do know my scalp feels better and my hair looks good.  Can\'t beat that. I\'m very pleased with this product and recommend it to others who need a boost in the hair department. "

I\'m glad the prescription strength products are finally hitting the market, because no one wants to go to the doctor to ask for a deodorant Rx.Anyway, you only apply this at night, so it is going to last a long time, and then the higher price doesn\'t seem too bad.  3 clicks of the product to each arm-pit.It is unscented, so if you wanted, you could always apply a deodorant after it dries, but make sure it is just deodorant and not another antiperspirant.I\'ve been using it about a week and have been very happy with it.  I have been doing a lot of yard work and thus working up quite the sweat.  So I will be in a full body sweat but my armpits are pretty dry.Even more importantly it keeps my shirts dry at work.

Let me just start off by mentioning why I rated this product 4 instead of 5 stars. All of the different setting on the brush seem fairly pointless so I think it it would be easy to downgrade to another Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series Toothbrush without the \'massaging\' \'whitening\' or \'deep clean\' settings. So this isn\'t really a negative aspect of the product but something that the consumer is paying for and doesn\'t seem to be getting any extra benefit. Save yourself the extra cash and just get one of the more basic models; I only use the daily clean setting.Since using the Oral-B I do believe that my teeth gave become more white and have a greater overall brush experience. I think this has much to do with the included \'Pro-White\' head that is included along with the \'Floss Action\' head. The rubber cup on the head really wipes away plaque and buildup. I can\'t really say that the \'Floss Action\' head is all that the name seems to claim but it does seem to be a great everyday head to use when accompanied with daily flossing.Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Oral-B Professional Care Series to anyone looking to take great care of their teeth.

Left razor burns all over and the back of my head became very scabby after 2 days of use.  Then I looked online and was able to find the 3-blade blades that come with the razor.  They are more than 2x as expensive as the Atra blades, but your head will thank you for it.  Those are also available here on Amazon, but not with free shipping.  I found them at the local Walgreens for approximately the same price and saved on the shipping.  The head is happy again!    "

From the first brushing, my teeth have felt incredibly smooth and clean, not just after brushing but all day long.  The floss-action brush is really good at cleaning between the teeth, too, as I found out when I manually flossed afterward. Consumer Reports rates this toothbrush (previously called the Oral-B Triumph) very highly, as do user reviews on several websites, and the toothbrush has not disappointed. Check the Oral-B website for a $[...] rebate through June 2010!Included in the box is a pro-white brush (in addition to the floss-action), a charger and covered compartment for the brush heads, a nice travel case for the base, and extra batteries for the smartguide. There is adhesive tape for mounting the smartguide on a wall or mirror, but the smartguide sits nicely on the bathroom counter as well. I like the smartguide and its dual function as a bathroom clock. Very cool. It also keeps me on track as I brush.As other reviewers have noted, the battery cover on the smartguide is somewhat difficult to remove, and you have to take it off to access the buttons to set the clock. The plug on the charger is also rather large and takes up a chunk of space on the bathroom counter.  These are small annoyances, though. I am very happy with my purchase so far, and Amazon did a great job with the shipping. I got my toothbrush in no time.  Thank you, Amazon!"

After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.    "

It looks a little scary coming out the tube with its tiny beads but it goes on smoothly and you just have to make sure you rub it in your arm pit completely so it doesnt stain up your clothes.It is suggested that you apply the deodorant at night before you sleep and that makes it more effective since it works with your body to block the pores.  It says it works just as well even if you shower in the morning and do not reapply since it works over night to block pores.I haven\'t tried that since I shower every morning and would rather apply it before i walk out the door.  Its more a preference for me.I would say so far so good.  The big test will come in the summer when I have a long sleeve shirt on in the heat here in Philly.

It is convenient to hang it on the shower wall. It stuck to the smooth surface of my ceramic tile well.The refill cartridges come in sealed plastic packages so they can be stored in the shower, inside the shower pod, without rusting or getting the aloe vera strip worn down from water.To sum it up, it gave a great shave, the shower pod was convenient and the sealed refills are very practical.I have no complaints!

I GENERALLY am a review & research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I\'ve read reviews on but I went in for a dental appointment years ago and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding & inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers so I was sold! I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn\'t compare any former experience and simply didn\'t know any better.  I DO have to say that other than my \'unsanitary\' concern about these that I\'ll get to in a moment, it\'s great! I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard, it\'s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine, I have never had any \'break\' or get wobbly on me, there is a color indicator where the blue area on your toothbrush gets lighter over time to let you know when it\'s time to swap out your toothbrush, etc.Let me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it\'s clean & smells good, my home is clean - in fact I\'m actually somewhat of a germaphobe so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  I know it\'s odd to point all that out but I didn\'t want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  :-).No matter WHAT I do...I\'ve tried using bottled water to brush my teeth thinking it\'s our tap water (it\'s not...my kids & hubby don\'t have an issue w/ their toothbrushes); I\'ve tried switching to a different toothsoap / tooth powder / toothpaste - and I STILL have the same issue.  My hubby & dentist have confirmed that I don\'t have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth so it\'s not in my mouth...so I\'m left to think that is DEFINITELY the DESIGN of Oral-B toothbrush replacements heads!!!Humor me for a minute and do a \'zoom\' on the picture of Oral-B replacement toothbrushes in the middle of the toothbrush handle.  There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle while brushing then certainly a mixture of that & water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets in.I DO make a habit of actually removing my brush head in running water and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks & on the bottom where you place the charger) AND on the toothbrush head itself - both on the brush area and on & inside the handle and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide & a clean washcloth (since I didn\'t know where the smell was coming from) AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  It does NOT happen when I take all of these precautions but in my opinion, I shouldn\'t HAVE to do this in order to avoid the musty smell...musty stench means that bacteria is harboring & growing so to stick something filled with germs to \'clean\' with is not the best option in my opinion.FYI: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it\'s not me and sure enough, it\'s not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn\'t have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I\'m currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it\'s a design flaw in the brush design.I\'d rather not have to worry if my toothbrush is growing bacteria or not, I want to simply rinse the brush & handle after each use and store it away like I\'m supposed to be able to do.  I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  I don\'t understand how anyone else hasn\'t complained about this issue - maybe I\'m taking care of them wrong but I\'ve even called the company and it was suggested that maybe it was our water or toothpaste...when I told her that my other family members didn\'t have this issue, she was at a loss.For those who are also looking & comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it\'s more dome shaped so the toothpaste \'gunk\' from brushing & rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the \'dome shape\' vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle & electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B\'s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it\'s hard to get in small areas of your mouth."

I find smaller toothbrushes take too long to get the job done, even allowing 2-3 minutes per brushing.The Oral B 60 brushes are hard to find in stores (and I do look), so a 6 pack lasts me a while. The brushes aren\'t too soft or hard, and my dentist thinks my old teeth aren\'t in all that bad condition, and seem to be reasonably well cleaned. I even give away the toothbrush he hands out at each visit and use the Oral B 60 instead."

I have written Amazon reviews for Oral-B products dating back to 2002. I have had very few dental issues in this time although, in fairness, I must also report that I began daily flossing during this time as well, and that may be just as important.This new model is a definite step up from the ancient \'Plak Control Plus\' model that I had been using. It\'s full name is \'Professional Care 3000\' and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument. The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one. Please note that this is not an ultrasonic toothbrush. Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action. The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth very quickly.The 3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button. The first is \'Daily Clean\' which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis. The second is \'Sensitive\' which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth. The third is \'Whitening\' which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \'Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\'The instructions that come with the 3000 recommend that you brush for 2 minutes - no less and no more. To assist you with this, once you turn the brush on it will pulse twice every 30 seconds. If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you\'ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times. To turn the brush off from any mode, just press and hold the on/off button.Built into the 3000 is a \'Hard Brushing Alert\' which is an LED on the handle that lights up if you are pressing too hard. Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth. Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly. The instructions say that the LED is, \'Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\' so apparently there\'s a dental health issue here as well. The brush is very powerful, so it\'s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.The brush comes with a charging stand and covered storage tray that can accommodate 4 brush heads. The storage tray is dishwasher-safe, the charging stand is not."

656,236,245,20050609,B0001LQGEM,5,"June 9, 2005",A2ERK85P6X5I6S,FINALLY! Something that works on my face!,"I have the worst possible combination for shaving: a thick beard and sensitive skin. Ingrown hairs and razor bumps were a weekly, if not daily occurance for me. I started off as a teenager with the original Sensor. When that got too painful I transitioned to the Sensor Excel. That served me well through my college years, where I could get away with shaving every 2 or 3 days. I found that my face needed a day or 2 off before I could shave comfortably again. When I entered the workforce, the president of my company noticed the stubble on my face during my \'off\' days and insisted that I shave every day. Well, after about a week of daily use with the Excel, my neck was about as raw and sore as it ever had been. That was about the time that Gillette introduced the Mach3. I transitioned to that, and eventually the Mach3 Turbo, but I was STILL getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps.I did some research and found that my technique (shaving against \'the grain\' without shaving with the grain first) was causing a great deal of my problems, so I started to change my ways with less than stellar results. The Mach3 was designed to be used \'against the grain\', and shaving in the direction of my hair growth produced almost no results at all. I couldn\'t even feel the razor cutting anything as I pulled it down along my face and neck. In addition, the added width of the blades made it nearly impossible to shave the areas underneath my nostrils. I had to keep my old Sensor handy to tackle that area when I was done with the rest of my face. My fiancee suggested spending $20 on the new battery-powered Mach3...no, thank you!Then I saw the Senor3, and decided to give it a try. The blades were cheaper than the Mach3 (even at Costco Warehouse prices), so it wasn\'t much of an investment for the experiment. All I have to say is, \'THANK GOODNESS!\' The Sensor3 has the best of both worlds between the Excel and the Mach3. The blades fit any Sensor handle, which is a more traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn\'t have to invest in a whole new system. It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it\'s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors AND I can get to the area under my nose. But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results. To the outside world I look clean-shaven every day, even though I can feel a tiny bit of stubble. That\'s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.I now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I\'m as smooth as a baby\'s backside. I\'ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort. The \'Art of Shaving\' products are a godsend. Invest in the Pre-Shave oil, trust me. I also went \'retro\' and picked up their shaving cream and brush. Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it\'s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route. I think I FINALLY found something that works for me after 15 years of shaving!    "

I love the smooth plastic applicator but I too had a problem with these staying put.  I guess they are too smooth for me.  I have a heavy flow the first few days so I tried the super size first.  I had to wear a pad with it to contain the leaks.  I recently tried the OB brand super size and they are perfect for my heavy flow days.  They do not fall out and they contain the leaks like no other.  I did use this multipack for my lighter days and got by with just a pantiliner but I can not get past having them fall out when I go to relieve myself.  I do not like having tampons in my septic system and I do not want to have to fish them out.  I have had two children so maybe these would have worked better prior to childbirth.

The box only includes one replaceable head, but replacement prices are reasonable, and I plan on buying the heads for my entire family.

They have worked wonderfully all that time; the only time I get nicked is sometimes on the first use of a new blade.  The last time I was shopping for blades, the ProSkin ones were on sale, so I thought I\'d try them (the ever-rising price on the Venus blades is their downside).The first time I used it, I wound up with about 6 different cuts, several of them bleeding freely.  I chalked it up to the first time.... Next use I still wound up bleeding (though not as badly).  After that I began to use regular shave-gel with the blade (defeating their whole point), and with that I still get razor burn and abrasions, but no bleeding.These blades defeat the very trait I use Venus razors for, and the earlier reviewer is correct-- the \'moisture bars\' fall off after a couple of weeks (maybe 5 or 6 uses in my case), making them no bargain (I can use the regular blades for a month or more each).The DO shave closely and leave skin smooth, but are not worth the trade-off in discomfort and blood.My advice is skip these and get any of the other blades in the line-- I\'ve tried them all at different times and they all work better than the ProSkin ones.

This toothbrush wowed me from the moment that I took it out of the box. First I have to point out that it comes FULLY CHARGED. Since when does an electronic item arrive at your door without needing charging? I was able to take it out and to use it immediately! The next thing I noticed was how much lighter it was than my three year old sonic toothbrush. It was more slender, shorter, and much, much more comfortable to hold. When I pulled the base out of the box I was simply astounded - how could something so small be a charger? I\'d been used to this huge base and now all I had to deal with was this tiny little thing, barely big enough to fit the base of the brush, but it did and it was extremely sturdy as well.The big challenge, though, was the brushing. My Vitality had a 2 minute warning feature on it, where it sort of stutters in the vibrations when two minutes is up. I loaded up the toothbrush with toothpaste and started the brushing. I could immediately notice the difference from my new Oral-b to my old sonic toothbrush, as this one rotated instead of just going up and down. I could simply gently guide the brush from one tooth to another, just like my dentist does, and the teeth were getting cleaned!Two minutes actually took much longer than I thought, and I was a bit ashamed to realize that I hadn\'t been brushing a whole two minutes for quite awhile! But eventually the stuttering happened and I turned off the brush and looked closely to see what the cleaning had done.WOW. Not only did the brush get in between a lot of my teeth to get some things that would normally be gotten by flossing, but it also polished my teeth as well! I was able to run my tongue around my teeth and was shocked to realize that my teeth felt exactly the same way after my home cleaning as it does after I\'m done a visit at the dentists.I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and am interested in the different heads that you can get to go on the toothbrush!

If one trusts the packaging, it out performs a manual toothbrush.  If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It\'s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one\'s teeth during brushing.I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one\'s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.So, it\'s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs."

It was a loud and eventually became sloppy in holding the spindle from turning around requiring the handle to constantly be rotated. It still was very effective and still holds it\'s charge without fail.Long story short, I did research and ended up choosing the professional care 5000 over the 4000 as a replacement.  The sticker shock held off the purchase until I found a 50% rebate and free priority prime shipping.  I really prefer the \'polishing\' heads and bought 6 extra.  Net cost was about $55 which is about + price of the additional brush heads.There is no comparison between this and our old model.  It is quiet and has some cool features.  There is a visible battery (fuel) gage on the handle, and a transmitter to communicate with a seperate remote unit.  This thing times you, is a clock, and even blinks if you brush too hard. The travel case is well constructed and useful. Buy one...rebate took about 2 weeks...mine was a $55 check.PROS:  quiet- cool features- teeth feel like you just had a cleaning...squeek and all- noticed definate whitening almost immediately- find myself brushing more often by choice, angled position allows makes getting to back teeth a non-issue. We love it and highly recommend it.Check out the polishing heads which have a yellow rubber center. It saves the outer bristles and you still get more than adequate flossing and unbelievable plaque removal. It really extends head life especially if you brush hard, like my wife. Trust me on this; I smoke cigars.NEGATIVES:  Really none..somewhat pricey heads, but more gental than even soft hand brushes."

My girlfriend will continue to use them for shaving her legs, as I don\'t think she\'s found anything better, but I\'m going back to my safety DE razor with Feather blades. I get as close a shave with them (closer if I go against-the-grain, though with more skin irritation) at 50 cents a blade (25-50 cents a shave, as I change them every one or two shaves). If I were to use Derby blades (my second favorite, but I only use for with-the-grain shaving), that would be closer to 8 cents a blade.    "

Initially frizzy & poofy the day I wash, but frizz mostly dies after i sleep on it.I usually alternate between wearing my hair curly, flat ironing it, or just doing nothing to it and tying it back in a bun.  But the past few months I had given up on wearing my hair curly because I was tired of all the bad products out there. They either did nothing to combat my frizzies, left my curls looking thin and \'scrunchy\', or left my hair just totally flat, which is quite the accomplishment because I have very long, thick hair with a lot of natural volume.My prayers are answered with the Pantene Pro-V Curly line!! I usually always try & use organic products on my hair (without sulfites and stuff) so I was hesitant to try this. But I\'m so glad I did. I bought the shampoo, the conditioner, the mousse & the hairspray. Together they are awesome! After my shower i wrapped my hair in a towel on top of my head, after about 10 minutes i undid the towel, then gently (i try not to toussle my hair around too much when its wet because i feel as if this makes it more frizzy) ran a moderate amount of mouse throughout my curls, separating them and making sure i coat all my hair.I let my hair air dry and occasionally twisted a few curls here and there with my finger and added a teenny tiny bit more mousse here and there where i thought it was starting to frizz up. My curls look extra curly, lots of volume, not crunchy at all & it helped with the frizz A LOT too. I used the hairspray VERY sparingly, i feel as if this is the only product in the line that may cause any sort of \'crunchiness\', so be careful with that one. Just don\'t use too much.I will use this line whenever i want to wear my hair curly (which will now be more often) but I will stick with my organic shampoos for all other times.Also, ***side note***, I was due for a trim when i tried this product so the ends of my hair were very frayed, and anyone with curly hair knows that just makes your hair look even MORE frizzy. So i used a dollop of \'nexxus pro mend  leave in treatment creme\' on my ends and...AMAZING! I know it doesn\'t really \'mend\' my split ends, but it does temporarily bind them together making them practically invisible (until i wash my hair again) and cuts down on almost all the frizz, so my ends look awesome. So i suggest adding that to your curly hair routine if you have split ends "

Since then I\'ve gone through a number of blades but have never replaced the handle, because I haven\'t had to.I have a pretty tough beard and have to shave daily if I want (or feel obliged) to look clean shaven.According to the current Wikipedia entry for the Mach3, the blades cost 9 cents to produce. I\'ve read conflicting stories about the history of disposable razor blades and I\'m not sure what to believe. But it seems to me that disposable razor blades and cartridge type blades in particular, like printer inks, are high profit margin items that deserve to be characterized as ripoffs. I recently tried using old fashioned double edge razors, the kind I stated with when I started shaving in the last sixties - I not only have my own old double-edge blade holder but have two even older ones that I inherited from my late dad - but as has always been my experience, I could not get through a shave without an annoying cut or two (and then I end up going out with little pieces of bloody tissue stuck to my face). If I thought I could get a clean, bloodless shave with a straight razor I\'d go that route. Electric razors can be okay in a pinch but it takes too much time and effort for me to get a really clean shave with an electric, and even then it\'s never as clean as the shave I can get with a Mach3. (I discovered Aveeno shave gel a few years ago and though I don\'t have sensitive skin, I\'ve found that it works better for me than any other gel or cream I\'ve used.)Obviously, not all guys have as good an experience with the Mach3 as I\'ve had, and that makes sense, because every guy\'s beard and skin is different.When I have more than a couple of day\'s growth, I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work.

The Mach III served me well, but the head kept coming off, the result of dropping it about 4 dozen too many times.  I\'ve been a Gillette user for a couple of decades, now, but I\'m open to anything which works.  Hint:  I consider any electric, as much as I\'d like to have one, useless.  I\'ve had a few, it was a waste of money for me, but my friends got exceptionally good hand-me-downs.I was *ULTRA-SKEPTICAL* about a 5-bladed razor, *especially* a \'powered\' one.  I mean, my triple-bladed beast was still cranking along, and after 15+ years, I\'ve become accustomed to having my facial hair more pulled out than cut.  It\'s a genentic thing not many people seem to suffer from, which is good for the greater population.  Put it this way, I have \'5 o-clock shadow by 10 AM\'.  It\'s not a good thing.  If I skip shaving for 36 hours, I start to look like a psycho-drifter who has been on the road for a few weeks.Anyway, I sprung for the powered version, figuring I could use all the help I could get.  Shockingly, no pun intended, the shave was not only *amazingly* close, but I didn\'t have the typical 2-5 cuts from having a new blade.  To make matters better, I mananged to have even sideburns for a change.I\'ve been in Vegas about a year and the mid-to-late-70\'s fat Elvis has started to transchannel my sideburns.  Not mutton-chops...yet, but they\'re obvious.  ;-)Anyway, after not my first, but third powered-Fusion shave, about six hours after shaving (at which point I\'d ususally give my wife a rash if I gave her more than a peck on the cheek) I said to her, \'hey, feel my chin.\'  I got an immediate \'WOW!\'  It\'s so nice to look normal for an entire day.There are downsides.  Blades are stupidly expensive and don\'t seem to last more than a week, but the behavior was similar with my Mach III.  I\'ve considered having a ton of cartridges treated with near absolute zero cold, as that appears to help longevity, but have never gotten around to it.    "

That\'s the way I felt after using this toothbrush.I\'ve tried plenty of motorized toothbrushes in the past, from expensive to the cheapies you can grab for six bucks at a supermarket, but I\'ve always returned to a standard manual brush. Not this time, though.The Vitality is really incredible. The included two-brush heads (and you get two of them) have an oscillating section at the top, and a section that goes back and forth beneath it. While one polishes and cleans one tooth, the other is getting between them, almost making floss redundant (I said almost). It even has a timer that goes off after two minutes, pulsating the motor a couple of times to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing.After charging it up for 16 hours (which they say will give you a week of twice-a-day brushing sessions), I followed the manufacturer\'s suggestions for how to use it (yes, I actually read them - all part of the review), and can honestly say no other home toothbrush has ever made my teeth feel so clean.Additional brush heads are available in various styles, though why I\'d ever want anything beyond the two brush style that came with it eludes me (they do make a polishing head though, which I suppose I can understand even if I\'m not personally interested). According to the instructions, each head should last about three months, and with refils costing about four bucks per head (in a package of six), that nets out to about 12 dollars a year for refils: a steal for how well this works.I\'m already buying another for my kids\' bathroom: because it comes with two heads they can each have one (downside: no color coding, so I\'ll use a sharpie to delineate them).A fantastic toothbrush that is at last worth ditching a standard manual brush for, I can recommend this without reservation."

I have been using Gillette sensor-series products almost exclusively since the Gillette sensor debuted in 1990.I graduated from Sensor, To Sensor II, to Mach 3, to Mach 3 power.I normally shave wet, with no shaving cream, and with down strokes, although I use some upstrokes. I have tested the Mach 5 both wet and dry, with no cuts or major problems.I have used the Gillette Fusion for 1 week, and here are my findings.Pluses:1) An overall great shave.2) The Fusion shaves better dry than any previous Sensor model. (Although I rarely have a reason to shave dry).3) More blades. More microfins!4) The plastic handle, while bulky, is very nice. The plastic is gentle to the touch, aa nice departure from the rigid, cold metal of the M3.5) Comes with a coupon for $2 off additional cartridges.Minuses:1) The confort strip wear out WAY too quickly.  My Mach3 blades last 3 weeks, My Fusion blade needs replacement after 1 week. Hopefully, the replacement blades will be better than the original ones (if so, I\'ll edit this review).2) Since there are more microfins with a larger area, and sincen the microfins become more imporant to the overall shave, the microfins trap more hairs than ever. Even washing the blade doesn\'t get rid of all of the microhairs trapped in the microfins.3) The 5 blades make upstrokes more difficult and don\'t offer the precision of the M3 and previous models for the tough spots (e.g. under the nose). On the soft ares of the face (e.g., the cheecks), the larger footprint makes it harder to press close and cut hairs close to the skin. However, this problem is somewhat offset by the additional blades and microfins.4) As always, the blades are more expensive than previous version. At this rate of inflation, Gillette blades will cost $50 each by the year 2030. =)Overall, it is a great product. I am undecided if I will keep using Fusion or switch back to the M3 as my primary. I might use both together (as I previously did with the M3 and Sensor Excel).    "

Whenever these shaving companies come out with these number-of-blade toppers, the inevitable question asked is \'where will it end?\'  I think the BladeMask comment answers that question in a facetious but, hey who knows, perhaps accurate way.  Touch&eacute;.I\'ve always been a (very) early adopter of Gillette blade innovations, so I bought the Fusion first day of release.  [ Hey, A.G. Lafley bought the whole freakin\' company after testing a Fusion prototype, so that\'s a pretty good testament.]In terms of the Fusion itself, there are pros and cons vs. upgrading from the Mach Turbo 3.The pros:- Does seem to be a better shave (certainly takes less strokes, that\'s for sure).  Gillette has succeeded in raising the bar again.- I suspect you\'ll get less wear on each blade meaning you\'ll be able to keep the blade in the razor longer.  [A key point when you  read my \'cons\'.]- The industrial design of the razor, the blade and how the two pieces fit together is a thing of beauty.  A real indication of the increasing pervasiveness of CAD in every aspect of our lives and the need to compete on functionality, price AND design.  [Thank you, Steve Jobs.]- The blade on the back is a real breakthrough.  Sounds bizarre in concept, but great in practice.  You\'ll keep your sideburns straighter and not bang up that space under your nose trying to cram 3+ blades under there.The cons:- Well, of course you need that backside razor because the darn surface face of the blade contraption is so big (this is the \'Big Bertha\' of razors) and spongy-flexible like a teenage gymnast that you can\'t get the shaving impact area within a country mile of the undersize of your nose.  The backside razor isn\'t just a coolness factor; it was birthed out of necessity.- Gillette has now taken its famed \'give way the razor to get the blade revenue\' business model (and the mother of all business analogies) to a price-gouging extreme.  $25 for eight blades? (and that\'s the discount).  What will happen is that shaver across the world will look for a way to extend the life of each blade.  Gillette famously doesn\'t recommend when to change blades  leaving the decision to each shaver (and, hey - Richard Nixon and I had different shaving needs, so how could they possibly recommend a standard).  But - my reaction will be to double the tenure of each blade I put in play.  I think others will consider the same practice.    "

It makes for a much more comfortable feel. I personally would have liked the handle to be a little bit wider, like maybe half an inch, but I\'m still pretty pleased with the shape and feel. While the Divine didn\'t slip in my hand very often, the Embrace doesn\'t slip in my hand at all, so there\'s less of a chance of a painful nick.The Embrace has a slightly larger razor head because of the \'ribbon of moisture\' strips around the blades. The larger razor head is a little annoying because I have to be more careful about maneuvering the razor over my \'bumps.\'However, I am extremely pleased by those \'ribbon of moisture\' strips. They make for an incredibly comfortable shave, much more so than the Divine. I could tell the difference in feel right away and it was amazing. Just that factor alone made this razor worth the price.The Embrace has five blades while the Divine has only three blades, and I can\'t really say I notice a difference in shaving efficiency or closeness because of the extra two blades. I *might* be able to feel a slight advantage to the extra blades, but I\'m also not entirely sure if that\'s all in my head or if it\'s real.The ShowerPod that comes with the Embrace allows you to snap your razor into place and store extra blades inside the plastic pod. It attaches to your shower wall via suction cups, which in my opinion is a huge improvement over the old Venus ShowerPods that required you to attach them with double-sided foam tape. The ShowerPod is a nice place to store the razor in the shower, but I honestly think the whole concept of storing extra blades in the shower is unnecessary. I never change my blades in the shower--I do it before or after--so in my opinion, the storage space in the ShowerPod is a waste of plastic.All in all, this is a great razor if only for the fact it\'s so much more comfortable than the Divine. Don\'t get me wrong, the Divine wasn\'t uncomfortable at all, but the Embrace has improved the model significantly.    "

It is small and holds to brush heads. It has a small profile so it wont take up a lot of counter space. It also has a mount where you can screw two nails on the wall and mount the stand on the wall.

That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that\'s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it\'s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you\'ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It\'s not like they\'ll go stale in the linen closet.Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.Hints:Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you\'re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you\'re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you\'ll do a serious \'eewwww.\'  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.  This is important.Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger. This will make that weekend maintenance simpler.That\'s it! Now get one for yourself and see."

The construction was also cheap, I had a Fusion break apart on me after a year.  I\'ve never had a Mach 3 break, over 10+ years of use.The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  But the trimmer would get clogged with hairs, which is annoying.The Fusion Proglide replaces the Fusion\'s dull blades with sharp blades that don\'t tug or pull on my skin, they just glide through and cut as they\'re supposed to.

I preordered this razor with the hopes it would be better than the original fusion. I am happy to say from my experience that it is to me. This razor has no pull on a three day old beard along with no nicks or cuts, this must be due to the thinner finer blades. This is why they call it the pro glide. The lubrication strip is a lot bigger than the original and the diffrence is slightly noticeable during the shave. There was no stubble left over with a second pass. I have never tried the fusion power due to I feel that it is sort of a gimmic with the vibration in ways that other power razors have cut me or tugged at the beard so I stick with the manual. So far i am very pleased with this razor and even ordered the blade refills already. I will never even look back at my old fusion now due to the upgraded comfort and longer lasting blades of proglide. One reviewer feels that this razor is not much of an upgrade from the original and to stick with the original fusion but I beg to differ strongly. The old fusion is nice but no where compares to the proglide. It is definately worth the almost $11 for the best shave I have found so far!    "

Gives an excellent and as close a shave as possible but not easy on skin  left it chronically slightly rough. The 3 blade Mach 3 was as good but couldn\'t shave under nose closely.

The pad LEAKS, LEAKS, runs off the top and bottom (but doesn\'t seem to leak through the pad).  I believe there was another reviewer who writes about a water test, where a significant amount of the fluid ran off rather than absorbing into the pad.  Infinity is definitely not comparable in protection to the Always Wings Super or Overnight variety, which NEVER leaks from any angle.  Second, Infinity feels \'wet\' against the skin, which is absolutely unacceptable when wearing for several hours.  Third, for the cost - get the superior absorbancy pad, the standard wings-style Always super or overnight protection.  I guess if you have very light periods, then the Infinity will work for you.

The lower \'sensitive\' speed does not tickle the gums, and the pick like brush allows me to carefully brush the gum line and the crevices between teeth.

I tried it on her immediately and can\'t say I noticed much difference. The odor is pleasant and the fine mist spray was adequate. It rinsed easily off of my hands, which is a major plus.The real test was my hair. I sprayed it down and just twisted it into several quick twists that I secured with bobby pins. I forgot about it for 2 hours and then removed the pins. Wow. My hair was so curly, more than I\'ve ever achieved even with a curling iron. The gel spray really held them without my hair feeling too crunchy or full of product. I  quickly gave myself a Medusa-style \'do with the curls going straight up off my scalp. I fluffed and frizzed it up. The volume of it was almost scary. Then I thought I\'d really test the gel spray. A few spritzes on my giant bunch of curls and immediately they unfrizzed and were easier to tame without losing all the volume.Ilove how versatile my hair suddenly feels. This gel was really fun to use when I felt the whim to change things up. I think it\'s inspired me to keep trying out something difference, since my hair has been straight and flat year after year.

5306,2133,2183,20110318,B002HWS9GG,5,"March 18, 2011",AW7BGAR3VSIY5,Great Toothbrush,"I bought the Oral-B 5000 brush after doing extensive research. This was my first electric or powered toothbrush. I will not compare it with Philips Sonicare as both are excellent brushes. I went with oral-b as I prefer a rotatory brush over a one that just moves up and down. If like me you are new to electric toothbrush and are wondering if it will be too harsh on your teeth and gums, then I can assure you that I found this oral-b 5000 very gentle. If fact, I would have preferred if it had a little bit more power. I have healthy teeth and gums so for someone who has very sensitive teeth this might be an issue. This brush however has a sensitive mode which reduces the power considerably so you can still go with it.The oral-b 5000 box came with a brush handle (oral-b trimph), 2 brush heads (1 flossaction. 1 prowhite), a smart guide, traveling case, a charging station (charging ring + brushhead storage stand) and a smart plug. An important note: only the oral-b 5000 and 4000 series come with a smart plug (100-240 V) adapter. Others 3000 and lower versions just work for US voltage only and you will need to buy a voltage converter if you want to travel with it. You can tell by looking at the pictures on the outside of the box. Smart plug is bigger as it has voltage conversion circuitry inside it, the other one is just an electric plug. Since I travel frequently, so this was very important to me and thus my choice was limited to 4000 or 5000 series only.Difference between the 4000 and 5000 is that 5000 has a smart guide and the charging station that has a place to store 4 extra brush heads, plus 5000 has one extra mode of operation. Other than that both are identical. The smart guide is not essential for brushing. It just shows you various information like the brushing mode you are using, total brush time, low battery indicator, over pressure warning. It also similes and winks at you! I find it convenient as all the information is in front of me, and if I wanted to change my brushing mode, I do not need to take the toothbrush out of my mouth. The toothbrush always starts in the daily clean mode and you cannot turn it on outside your mouth, as it then sprays toothpaste all over the counter and sink, so if it was not for the smart guide, you will find it very difficult to select the desired brushing mode on the toothbrush.The brush handle and brush heads are made in Germany. They appear well-constructed. The brush handle is water proof and factory sealed against moisture. This is very important as otherwise the moisture will ruin the battery and the circuitry inside, a common problem with electric brushes powered with replaceable AA batteries. The toothbrush is charged through magnetic induction, so it is safe to put the charging station on the bathroom counter, near water. Brush heads are easy to clean and replace. In fact, more than 1 person can use the brush handle, as the only thing that goes into the mouth is the brush head and each person can use their own brush head. The brush heads come with their own colored rings, so you cannot mix your brush head with someone else. The battery life is good and with my typical brushing time of 4-5 minutes twice a day, it lasts for 4-5 days.Finally, about the price. I got the 50% off offer, so the 5000 ended up costing me about $65. It was an excellent deal for me. Is this brush worth $159? Well, I would have to say no. If you can get it for below $100 then it is an excellent deal. Is it better than a manual toothbrush? I would have to say yes! It is 200% better than a manual toothbrush. In fact, after using this you will wonder why you did not switch before.Now, if the brush handle lasts for 3 years and each brush head lasts for at least 5 months, then I will be satisfied with my $65 down payment on this toothbrush.I hope my review was useful. I have tried to concentrate on information I did not find in other reviews. If anyone needs additional information just write a comment on this review and I will respond."

The skin does not get irritated and turn red. It does a very good job!!  It\'s also very light-weight and easy to hold in hand.  I love it!    "

2418,1998,2070,20100702,B003987CL0,1,"July 2, 2010",AU70G084OYMMM,Nothing special about this razor when compared to the others.,"I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age. The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better but that was always not the case. So I\'ll briefly compare this to the other razors I\'ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel. The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade. Thats all I have to say about that.The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner. Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same. So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave but I still decided to stick with the comfort of the Mach 3. So up till now the Mach 3 was my razor of choice.Now the story changes a bit:I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided. I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking I would never use anything else. BAD DECISION!!!! My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power. At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I\'m getter older so it\'s my skin\'s fault. I would get ingrown hairs and it was then embarrassing to go out. I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved. I tried various skin treatments to rid of the irritations and redness but nothing would work. The problem with the fusion was that the blades would only last about 3 shaves and then irritate the hell out of your face. ONE DAY I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY ANOTHER RAZOR.I then bought the Schick Quattro Titanium and boy was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion. It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever. They would stay sharp for months and wouldn\'t clog if a shave gel was used.(I know people complain that it clogs but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh it doesn\'t).Now Hydro 5 vs. Fusion ProglideHydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5. At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water. The shave was not as close as I would have wanted. The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge. Still I kept on using it since it came with 2 refills anyway. The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.Fusion Proglide: I bought the sneak peek package just to try the razor before it came out and all I can say is AWFULLLLLL!!!!!!! This time I couldn\'t even get one good shave from this crap. Turns shaving into gliding my A$$!!!! It\'s very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot. So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I\'ve ever used so far. The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind the exaggeration but you know what I mean).Final verdict: Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers. They are nothing but marketing now. Up until the Mach 3 they were my razor brand but the fusion and fusion proglide are nothing but scams. They look cool but I think they are face wreckers. Then again I have sensitive skin so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise. Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help. So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin. It will not clog with Zirh or Anthony Logistics shave gel and causes no irritation. The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates. Sorry for long review but I just had to share my experience.    "
5774,2601,2664,20100906,B003UKKH6O,4,"September 6, 2010",AC24H4N4HYNU5,Nicely priced for a first-time user of an electric toothbrush,"This is my first electric toothbrush. I am extremely happy with it. I would recommend it as an entry-level electric toothbrush to those who are too unsure about the technology to pay for one of the more higher priced models.Full disclosure: I received this toothbrush free as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, at the low cost of $29.99 I probably would\'ve bought it anyway. I think it is definitely worth that price for a first-time electric toothbrush.PROSCLEANING: My teeth get much cleaner when I use this toothbrush versus my traditional one. They feel smooth, just like I came from the dentist. Flossing also seems easier while using this toothbrush because, with the right tilt on the brush, it is better able to clean between my teeth and at the gum line, so there seems to be less tartar buildup when I floss.WHITENING: The stain removal is EXCELLENT. My teeth are not that stained, but during the 2 weeks I\'ve been using this brush, I\'ve noticed a *significant* decrease in the yellow stains near my gum line.BATTERY: This may sound odd, but I liked the way the battery ran out. I was a bit concerned about what would happen and how I would handle it (the instructions give no clue). It pretty much just stops working, no wind-down at all. I liked that because it left no mystery as to \'will it or won\'t it\' finish and I just finished brushing my teeth with it manually. I\'ve used this toothbrush 1-2 times per day for over 2 weeks now, and I\'ve only had to charge it once.REPLACEMENTS: The brush indicates when it needs to be replaced via color loss on the bristles (just like some traditional toothbrushes do). It does come with an extra head, as well as a $3 coupon for another one.CONSDROPLETS: The only negative on this toothbrush is probably just due to my inexperience with electric toothbrushes: it sprays toothpaste droplets onto my clothing. Now I try to brush my teeth before I dress, or else I drape a hand towel over my blouse while brushing.VIBRATIONS: As others have mentioned, the vibrations are INCREDIBLY strong on this toothbrush. You should NOT press it hard against your teeth; just lay it gently onto them and let the brush do the work for you. My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive (I have several cracked ones) and once I stopped pressing with the brush, I had no problems with pain due to the vibrations. However, the vibrations DO make my nose ticklish.Unlike other reviewers, I have NOT experienced any \'gunk\' buildup in the toothbrush stand because I always rinse off my toothbrush the way the instructions say to. (If you put ANY toothbrush back in its holder without rinsing it well enough, you\'re going to get \'gunk.\')Overall, I would recommend this as a fine first electric toothbrush, especially at this price point."

Excellent coverage and leak protection, especially for plus size ladies. I also highly recommend them for women suffering from urinary incontinence and/or interstitial cystitis for everyday wear. I would think cotton undies would work the best with these and be the most comfortable.  Two could be carried discreetly in a purse, inside a small zippered makeup case. After half a century this is one of very few products that in my opinion are perfectly designed."

It is similar to the Embrace Venus razor, but the Embrace has rubberized strips that make the blades float above the skin.  The Venus Spa Breeze Razor has two strips of very hard milled soap on the top and bottom so that you do not have to use soap or shaving cream/lotion when you shave.The soap is not overly scented.  It is not overly lathery either, which surprised me.  It is quite solid and does not melt easily, which is good because you won\'t blow through the soap before you finish the razor in sharpness.The soap does have sodium lauryl sulfate (and some relatives) in it which I avoid in my skin care products, but it is not a large amount and it did not leave my skin parched when I got done using it.The storage rack that comes with the Spa Breeze Razor is nice but I don\'t like the way it attaches to the wall.  It has two square adhesive strips that you are supposed to attach to a clean shower wall and then hang the case up on it with little knobs that hook it in.  I don\'t like that idea- there is too much risk of sticky being left behind being yet another challenge in cleaning the walls of the shower once it has lived through its usefulness and has to be removed.I have given this four stars because of the case mounting idea, and the fact that I don\'t like this razor quite as much as the EMBRACE by Venus.

When all the conditioning stuff was gone I bought a pack or refills, because I loved it so much. Oh and I have ridiculously sensitive skin and this razor didn\'t bother me at all so that is a huge plus! I would recommend this razor to anyone!    "

Yes, the replacement cartridges are very high-priced BUT you\'ll get an ultra-smooth and very clean shave every time--and your skin will thank you. The idea of a 5-blade razor may seem extreme to some but it really does work well and (with proper preparation) will give you the smoothest shave possible. For me, the best thing about the Gillette Fusion system is I can shave (both my head and face) with virtually NO irritation, redness or razor bumps AND get it done very quickly (at least in comparison to single or twin-blade razors). Case in point: I used to literally tear up my neck (especially around my Adam\'s apple area) years ago when shaving with single or 2-blade razors but with the Fusion I get a nick-free shave almost every time.

I have the more expensive model that briefly stops every 15 seconds so you know when to change quadrants in your mouth.I got this  \'Vitality Floss Action\' brush and have to say that for the money I think one would be hard pressed to find a better buy.I agree with the other positive reviewers on all the important points but most importantly to me is VALUE. This toothbrush does an excellent job of brushing and massaging the gums. Furthermore, I believe there are different specialty brush head replacements that can be purchased. It DOES have a two minute time. In my opinion this is just as good if not better than having a 15 second timer. If you just brush your whole mouth for the full two minutes you\'ll get just as thorough and perhaps more so than if you do 15 seconds peer quadrant because you\'ll have almost as much paste on the brush for the other quadrants of your mouth. With the 15 second per quadrant type of brushing, by the time you get to the final quadrant you\'ve pretty much used all the fresh tooth paste.This is a bare bones electric toothbrush. It doesn\'t come with a travel case but I love it and see no reason to spend an extra $100 for a fancier Oral B or the other leading competitor."

They were both very expensive (more than $100 each) and the replacement heads were expensive too.  Rather than buy an expensive replacement head I bought this Oral-B Vitality and it has been superb and I am very pleased for the performance and price.  The brush action (back and forth) is fast and powerful leaving my teeth and gums feeling very clean.  The replacement heads are reasonably price.  I recommend this brush since I have been very happy with it.

NOT sold by \'So & So\' and \'Fulfilled\' by Amazon - not good. Unfortunately these 3rd party sellers are selling fake blades - the ones everybody\'s complaining about - the same ones you\'ll find all over e-bay.I\'m ashamed to say I\'ve been using the fake (knock-off, counterfeit) blades for a couple of years. I had a hunch that either something was wrong or Gillette wasn\'t consistent with their product. Because some blades were better than others, some just didn\'t feel right from the start, and none of them lasted all that long. So this time around when I went looking to purchase new shaving materials I heard all this talk about phony blades and it all made sense. Those bums definitely made a fool out of me with their slick packaging, because they certainly \'look\' like real authentic Gillette replacement blades but they aren\'t.And now that I\'ve once again shaved my head with a REAL Gillette Mach 3 Turbo blade purchased from a reputable retailer (Amazon) I now realize what I have been missing - a smooth, close, effortless shave which doesn\'t tear me up. And to my surprise the lubricating feature on the Turbo actually works! A great product.One more word of advice - keep your eye on the price of this item as it fluctuates often! Keep it in your shopping cart and buy when the price drops. I paid $1.83 per blade. Great deal.Once again... ships and sold by Amazon... VERY important!!!    "
