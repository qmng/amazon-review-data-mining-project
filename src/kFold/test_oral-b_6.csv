2603,2666,20100904,B003UKKH6O,5,"September 4, 2010",A2KJZXIXBHVG0K,Very Good Rechargeable Toothbrush,"The Oral-B Vitality rechargeable toothbrush is very effective in cleaning and polishing teeth and stimulating gums.  The kit includes two ProWhite brush heads designed to remove surface stains and polish teeth bright white.  There are three types of brushing fibers in the ProWhite rotating brush, blue, white, and green, each with a different stiffness.  The longest and least stiff blue fibers gradually loose color with use indicating the remaining life of the brush (listed as 3 months).  There is a deep cleaning orange rubber center in the brush for deep cleaning of stains.  I have noticed a clean difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums after a week of using the ProWhite.The handle of the device fits the hand nicely because of its large diameter and a ribbed blue rubber grip covering the back of the smooth light blue plastic cylinder. The cylinder has a battery that is recharged by placing it upright on a plastic stand. The unit fits on the stand with a plastic receiver on a plastic plug, so electric shock to the user is avoided. The entire hand device can be rinsed completely (not the recharging stand).There is a built in timer on the Vitality that alerts the brusher when the recommended brush time of two minutes have elapsed with a noticeable pulsing action of the brushes and the accompanying change in sound from continuous to intermittent. After the timing alert, the device resumes continuous brushing.I highly recommend this rechargeable toothbrush.  I have switched from a regular brush to the exclusive use of the Vitality. I will order the four other brush heads each with a unique cleaning function. A $3.00 coupon for these heads is included in the kit. The rotary action of the brush is superior to the electric toothbrush I tried years ago that used an up and down motion that I did not like."

2189,2239,20110127,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 27, 2011",AVPU8ZZO6I8TA,Love love love!,"I decided to step further into the 21st century by purchasing an electric toothbrush.  I had one in a drawer that cost under $20 that I never used because it was heavy and loud so I always thought I would stick to a manual toothbrush, much to the consternation of my dentist.  After reading a few reviews and talking to my hygenist I decided on the Oral-B 5000 and love it!  At first it seemed like way too much technology for something so basic, but after the short read through the manual and letting it charge I was ready to go and it only took a few uses to get the hang of.  The manual was very easy to read and understand and didn\'t really take that long to review.  Another reason that I decided on the Oral-B was because of the smaller head of the brush.  A friend of mine with another brand toothbrush said that she wishes that she had thought of that when she purchased hers.  It really is a great toothbrush and I do really feel that it deep cleans.  My only complaint about the toothbrush is that it is sort of loud, but on the sensitive setting it isn\'t too bad.  But if you need help waking up in the morning...maybe the noise will help!  Overall I really do love it and see it as a good investment into my oral hygiene."
2512,2571,20111206,B002HWS9GG,4,"December 6, 2011",A3E8L30T1L52TX,Great electric toothbrush but the 4000 is a better buy,This does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  The only other electric toothbrushes I have used have been lower end models and they are not even in the same league as this toothbrush.  I use this with the Floss Action brush heads and my teeth feel great after.I bought this when Oral-B was having a 50% rebate so I paid only $50 for it.  Killer deal at that price.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the 4000 series is a much better buy.  It is definitely not worth it to pay any extra for the stupid Wireless SmartGuide; it\'s completely useless. Go with the 4000 which is the same unit and you will be much happier.

My teeth didn\'t look this clean even after a visit to the dentist. Don\'t think twice, at this price, this is an awesome buy, and a very small price to pay for clean shiny teeth!!"
1469,1503,20100429,B001CX4JSS,4,"April 29, 2010",AFLE473NPADNJ,Great Toothbrush But May Last Only a Year,This is the 2nd one that I had purchased online. The first one was purchased a year ago and it just stopped working. I bought another one and it looks great and does a good job cleaning your teeth. It leaves you with that \'just came from the dentist\'s office teeth cleaning feeling.\'I hope this one lasts longer that a year.I would give the product 5 stars if I knew it would last more than a year.
1942,1987,20111117,B002HWS9GG,2,"November 17, 2011",A3UGDA8CS0IYH5,Product is falling apart after 1 year of use,"I purchased it on September 26, 2010. This product works great, and I loved it.  About a month ago, this product is starting to fall part.  The battery is no longer holding its charge, and the motor is starting to act up.  I expected to use this product without problems for over two years.  I am feeling cheated and unhappy with this purchase now."
2837,2912,20100923,B003UKM90Q,4,"September 23, 2010",A3AAK33K3BUUTM,For that belt sander fresh sensation!,"I\'ve got to admit that this little oral power tool does a hell of a job cleaning teeth.  The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  I can\'t comment on the alleged \'flossing action\' since I still floss and I\'m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven\'t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  The things we do for oral hygiene.So yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B\'s Vitality.  That\'s just your teeth and gums howling like Westley from The Princess Bride being tortured.  Well, your teeth and gums are wimps.  They\'ll get used to it and thank you later.  Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you\'ve just had a professional cleaning.  The secret, of course is the much-vaunted circular buffing motion.  You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  Problem solved.  Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there\'s not a lot to complain about.  If you\'ve got the bucks and a hankering for oral hygiene, then you could surely do worse than to invest in Vitality."
1612,1654,20080827,B001CX4JSS,5,"August 27, 2008",A2X61KKXXR6WNP,A better toothbrush,"This product is Oral-B\'s answer to the Sonicare, as both of them clean teeth using ultrasonics (tiny vibrations) instead of a more standard rotating head.  Kind of like the old vibrating toothbrushes from long ago, except the power behind this is far greater, and much more effective.Sonicare had the benefit of being first with this type of brush, but Oral-B has an advantage in that they can study the other product and make improvements on it.  I\'d say the major difference is that the Oral-B is thinner, lighter, and therefore easier to hold and maneuver around the mouth.  The replacement brushes are also less expensive on this model, which is important as they can really add up if you replace them as recommended by the manufacturer, every three months or so.I was pleased to see that toothpaste can be used with it, although if you use too much you\'ll be foaming at the mouth from the ultrasonics.  It is still pretty foamy, so I recommend staying close to the sink.The recharging base is small, attractive, and wall-mountable.  The power cord plugs into a wall outlet and doesn\'t use a transformer, so it won\'t take up additional outlets. It will hold two spare brush heads behind the toothbrush, and allows the toothbrush to be dropped in facing any direction.  So, when you are done it is an easy matter to drop the toothbrush back onto its base.It actually worked quite a bit better than I expected.  The head is fairly small, so it is easy to move around your mouth to clean each tooth.  The timer lets you know if you are rushing the job (I usually am, but at least now I can\'t pretend I don\'t know that!).  The massage mode for the brush seems like a feature that I\'ll never use, but people with tender gums that are working their way up to the full speed might like it.  I use mine on clean mode all the time and it works well.  It is somewhat annoying that both modes are accessible through the single button given that I never use the lower-speed.  It isn\'t so annoying that it is a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.I was happy with the noise level, too.  Nothing bugs me more than holding something that sounds like a buzz saw so close to my ear in the morning.  Mercifully, this brush is pretty quiet, as these things go.  It is louder than a manual brush, of course, but quieter than an electric shaver.  The pitch is a little high, but nothing I can\'t live with.Overall, I like it and would get it again.  Recommended.Sean P. Logue, 2008"
2391,2447,20100913,B002HWS9GG,5,"September 13, 2010",A1VODMTWETPKT,true believer,"This is my second version; I left the first in a hotel room and couldn\'t live without it.  There\'s more equipment than you need.  For example, I never used the electronic meter that helps you gage how much pressure to use.  But the brush itself is terrific and helped me overcome gum disease."

2876,2956,20100823,B003UKM90Q,4,"August 23, 2010",A17O9AHKHK66AI,Great brush for the money.  Cleans thoroughly but not too hard.,"I have SLE with sjogrens (an autoimmune condition that has left my salivary glands barely functional).  My gums are fragile and are a mess, because I don\'t have enough spit.  Worse, I get cavities on the fronts of my teeth.  I\'m lucky to have a great dentist who is working to help me save my teeth and gums, but it requires a lot of vigilance on my part.On a friend\'s recommendation, I started using a sonicare elite.  That brush does a great job, but brush heads are expensive and a little on the hard side.  Every time I brush my teeth with that one, the sink looks like a crime scene by the time I am finished.  The Oral-b vitality did not rough up my gums nearly as much, and it costs about the same as a replacement brush pack for the sonicare.On the other hand, the brush head feels a bit more bulky in my mouth and my teeth don\'t feel quite as clean as they usually do, but I don\'t dread using it nearly as much as I do the sonicare.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this brush an 8, based on price (great), comfort level (nice and soft but bulky), convenience (the 2 minute timer is important), and cleaning (not quite as good as my other power toothbrush)."
1361,1393,20110922,B001CSZTFK,5,"September 22, 2011",AW88M36BVEEI8,Priced right,I was glad I purchased the additional brush heads at the same time as the toothbrush as the brush head that came with it wouldn\'t stay on so I was able to try another option before returning the toothbrush so glad I didn\'t have to do that.These brush heads were a lot cheaper than standard retail and I\'m all about saving money whenever and wherever I can. I will definitely replace the brush heads from this vendor when I need to.

2333,2387,20101021,B002HWS9GG,4,"October 21, 2010",A3IVLA7N2MKSSK,Oral B 5000,"First of all, Amazon is the best place to find this product for the price. Any retail store you go to this is going to be around $140-$160.I will start with the pros. The first time I started using the Oral B 5000 toothbrush I noticed how clean my teeth felt after brushing. I have been using this product for over a month now and love the pressure sensor. That is the main reason why I bought this product is because I have a habit of brushing hard. It has 4 dedicated modes which are great and one mode with extended time. I switch modes pretty much every time I use it. My teeth are getting slightly whiter after a month. The wireless brushing guide/clock is really handy so you can see what mode you are on and how much time you have been brushing. The charging base is great and very portable compared to other models.Now the cons. There are only a few things that I can think of that aren\'t that great with this toothbrush. The display mode on the handle really bugs me. It just displays the battery and nothing else. This is pretty pointless especially when you travel. Because it doesn\'t tell you which mode you are in so you have to go by feel to figure which mode you want. The display of the battery is so large it makes me wonder how much battery it drains to display that thing because its always on. That brings me to my next point is the life of the battery. It says in the manual that the life is 10 days. But seems to be less than that. My girlfriend has the 4000 and hers lasts longer than mine. Her display is for the battery is smaller and in the corner of the display instead of enourmous and in the middle. Other than big default this product is great especially for the price Amazon has it at!"
3052,3138,20120212,B0043VYSI2,5,"February 12, 2012",A10KZHHT34FX1I,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!,"This toothbrush is by far way better than any sonicare that I have used before! The timers is a plus which guides you and even tells you if your pressing too hard. I first bought this a while back ago but didn\'t want to write a review until I fully tested it out for a several months. I bought mine from Oral Care Deals so this review is from their product, and I was very pleased by them. One thing that I absolutely LOVED about this toothbrush was its ability to change the brush tip, which also comes with colored rings that you can identify which person it belongs too. I initially was looking for an electric toothbrush for me and my husband but when i came across this one i found out that we can both use it and all we have to do is to change the brush tip. It comes with a brush tip holder that you can place 4 tips one, so basically 4 people can use this one brush, now thats awesome by itself! We found that the battery is long lasting so you don\'t need to charge it after a few brushes. the grip is comfortable and its easy on the wrist! every time I brush I get the same feeling as i do when i go to my dentist for my six month cleaning. My dentist even said this is the best one on the market right now. Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well. bottom line don\'t hesitate to buy this model (dental professional exclusive 5000 series) because it an investment that will pay off."

1815,1860,20080809,B002D240KE,5,"August 9, 2008",A2I2ZAJLC8JQD,Great toothbrush!,"I love this toothbrush.  Though it took a few times to get used to using an electric toothbrush, once I got the hang of it I can definitely see a difference in my teeth.  I was using it for about two to three weeks before a dentist appointment and my dentist told me that she sees a huge difference and my teeth never looked better.  While getting a cleaning, I also noticed that the hygentist did not have to do nearly as much scraping as she usually has had to.  I definitely give this two thumbs up and is worth the investment!"

2794,2868,20110411,B003UKM90Q,5,"April 11, 2011",A2SAXJ6W8Q3LOL,Much better electric toothbrush for sensitive teeth than Sonicare,"My Sonicare electric toothbrush finally gave up and wouldn\'t charge anymore after a good 8 years of use.  I have sensitive teeth at the gum line and my dentist said that the \'sonic\' action irritates the sensitivity and to use only once a day (use regular toothbrush on other brushings).  I like using electric toothbrushes because I have forearm and elbow pain from the manual tooth brushing up and down action. Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms. I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  The negative reviews I read seemed like they were isolated instances of the toothbrush going out shortly after purchase, and was not the \'norm.\'  I thought that if I ended up with a \'bad egg\' toothbrush, Amazon would replace easily (as stated in some reviews I read).  I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  And surprisingly, the little \'rubber pieces\' that act as \'floss action\' actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums feel great and look clean after brushing.  Some other bonus items I liked about this product: came with 2 brush heads, so won\'t need to replace heads for at least 6 months; also liked the 2 minute timer alert, but not shutting off so I can finish brushing when I chose to turn it off. I would recommend this toothbrush as a mid-level electric toothbrush, where you don\'t have to buy replacement batteries, yet don\'t value the \'upgrade\' pressure sensing, sonic, covered brush head, multiple handles, etc. of the high-level electric toothbrushes."

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17 (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)What worries me about this listing is that it claims to be the Extrasoft EB17, but the picture of the item shows the Flexisoft EB17.  Be warned, Amazon might be confused about this item and selling it incorrectly labeled.  On the Extrasoft EB17, all the bristles around the outside edge are the same color.  If you\'re looking for Extrasoft, make sure you find an item where the picture matches the description."

The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I\'d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a \'recognized name\' in oral hygiene (for whatever that\'s worth), and it\'s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).Since I don\'t have firsthand experience with other moto-brushes, I can\'t write a comparative review, but I CAN comment on this product\'s effectiveness in comparison with regular brushes, and that comparison is altogether favorable. Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before. This model features a two-minute timer, which is helpful. It\'s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well (I use it twice a day, and only need to charge it about once every eight days).Oral-b manufactures a variety of different heads for the Vitality line, and though I\'ve not tested the different varieties to see if they have markedly different results, I like the fact that the product is so well-supported; it means I probably won\'t soon find myself owning an obsolete brush for which I can\'t get replacement heads. The heads are sturdy, too, lasting me about three weeks or a month each.Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn\'t do things I don\'t need it to, doesn\'t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support.

I found the best value on Amazon by BelowCostJML. They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&H for my whole shipment. (I ordered 5x the item of 6 brushes/ea, so 3 bucks S&H for 30 brush heads).Other sellers came somewhat close in pricing but wanted $7-10 S&H fees, not to mention that some would limit you to 1 item (of 3 brushes)/order. So if I wanted to increase the quantity to get the 30 brush heads I got from BelowCostJML, I would have to literally place the order 10 times and pay the ludicrous S&H cost 10x!I\'m thankful for BelowCostJML\'s fair pricing, including S&H and for their great service! The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time. Very pleased with the service!The product speaks for itself, I\'ve been a satisfied user for 8 years and I personally find it gentler in the mouth than Sonicare [I\'ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque (it\'s just a matter of each individual\'s preference)... I guess the \'difference\' would be equivalent to Pepsi versus Coke if you will (not that I\'m encouraging regular consumption of either): they give you the same overall effect, it just depends which one you prefer best. Hope this helped. Happy brushing (and don\'t forget to floss, too). :-)"

It is powerful, and the first time I used it I was struck by how very clean my teeth felt. They felt more like I had just come out of the denitist office with a teeth cleaning than like I had brushed them by hand (except without the pain the dentist sometimes causes)! The toothbrush has a nice, small recharger, which is perfect for my small bathroom! I am super happy with this, and it came with a spare brush too!"
1199,1226,20110728,B000AUIFCA,5,"July 28, 2011",A30IWHQ2DD2N3L,Oral B Floss Action,I just bought the Oral B Professional Care Smart Series rechargeable toothbrush. The Floss Action head is a must have! I already notice the differnce along the gum lines. Nothing is left behind. My teeth have never been so clean! Great product!!
526,537,20100105,B0002KHU3I,4,"January 5, 2010",A1P948LMDI28W4,Great product though not perfect,"Being an engineer, I did extensive research before buying an \'automatic\' toothbrush, and wound up selecting the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  The Oral-B has one huge benefit over the SoniCare I was considering and that was the rotary action since the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750 also has \'sonic\' pulsations.  A lower-end Oral-B had the dual-action brushes, but wasn\'t \'sonic\'.  Did a bit more research on the Oral-B website and found this dual-action brush head to be compatible with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750.  This was just another huge advantage of the Oral-B over the SoniCare automatic toothbrush.  Since these dual-action toothbrushes weren\'t too expensive, I took a gamble and brought three 3-packs.  This was about 4-months ago, and I\'m still using the first one from my purchase.I definitely felt a cleaner difference from the dual-action brush head than the rotating brush head that came with my Oral-B.  The lateral vibrating brush not only help loosen gunk from your teeth, it also provides the surface area for the toothpaste, and an additional \'sonic\' surface.  With just the rotating brush head, I generally cannot finish brushing within the two-minute recommended brushing time and take at least 4 minutes.  With the dual-action brush head, I\'m able to do it in 2-minutes and my mouth feels much cleaner.  And my teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter.  I had cavity filings that were colored to match my yellowish teeth, and now I can clearly see that my teeth are a much whiter shade than my filings.  (This was without change in toothpaste, and actually reduced time in brushing).So what can be improved?  Three things.  One is the dual-action brush head is a bit thick, although not much thicker than the regular rotary brush heads.  Would be nice to have a flatter profile.  Second is that flossing action bristles should come on the rotary part of the dual-action brush head (like that on the rotary brush that came with the Oral-B SmartSeries 4750).  And third, and the most important, is that the rotary part and the lateral vibrating parts of the dual-action brush head should be angled about 10 degrees to contour fit the curve of one\'s teeth.  This will optimize the contact surface at any time we\'re gliding the brush during brushing.  With these improvements, I would give it 5-stars... food-for-thought for any Oral-B employees reading this."

It\'s an electric toothbrush that\'s about the same size a conventional toothbrush!And it does a good job of cleaning my teeth. I\'ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I\'m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance. It\'s a mighty little toothbrush.The one and only drawback I\'ve found -- and it\'s a small one --  is that unlike the Sonicare the Pulsonic doesn\'t have a 2 minute timer. Instead it has a 30 second timer.  You have to count to four without electronic assistance (Four 30-sec treatments equal 2 minutes which is my Dentist\'s recommended brushing time.)Also as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars. Most toothbrushes -- both electric and non-electric -- fail this test. So that\'s another big plus.So in a nutshell, if you\'re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel), small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all."

I have resisted this purchase for years, but it has become apparent that I really needed to get one.  Research indicated that this was the best brush as far as effectiveness.I\'m not all that excited about vibrating toothbrushes--reminds me a lot of going to the dentist.  But this really isn\'t so bad.  I was a little skeptical--but after feeling the \'dentist clean\' feeling, I was sold.  I love that the brush stops if i try to brush too hard.  the little display that shows the quadrants and how long you are brushing is a little helpful--although certainly not a selling feature in my book.  funny though, i found as did many reviewers, that this serves as a great bathroom clock!The information on amazon can be a bit confusing.  You get a travel case, charger, 2 brush tips (1 pro white and 1 floss), and the display.The handle is a bit on the large size and i\'m not sure it would be good for children.  I prefer smaller handles, however, they can\'t fit all that computer programming into a smaller handle.You do have to practice a bit at keeping your mouth closed enough that the toothbrush doesn\'t spray.  But it has never been a real issue for me--i would say any spray has been minimal.  And every electric toothbrush has this issue.I prefer the smaller brush head on these to the larger brush heads.  on normal toothbrushes I prefer full size brush heads--but when you have a large handle, it seems much more maneuverable to have the smaller head.  And it doesn\'t feel stranger or bother me--i adapted on first use.When you are done using, it is best to remove brush from handle and thoroughly run it under water.  This can prevent toothpaste from building up.Oral B has a 60 day try it guarantee and will refund your money if you are not happy.  That seems like a good deal."

Oral B has discontinued the Sonic line.  So, I tried the Professional Care/Smart Series - what an improvement!  I like it much better than the Sonic Complete.  It brushes much more thoroughly.On the downside, it is a bit louder (not a big deal) and the RPM drops noticeably as the days go by until I recharge it.  (I don\'t leave it in the charger after every use, only when the battery is almost dead).I went with the 5000 over the lower models because the price was insignificantly higher at the time.  I will admit that I don\'t use the advanced features that the 5000 has over the lower models.  The massaging and other brushing modes don\'t impress me; I just use the regular mode.  (I used to use the soft mode on the Sonic Complete, but I don\'t have a problem with the aggressiveness of the regular mode in the 5000).

I prefer the oral-b / braun non-sonic over the sonic models. I am a big fan of this style of toothbrush & have owned them for almost two decades. I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years) and this one is my favorite. The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \'brake light\' which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums. Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \'get all up in there\', but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful. I buy the \'extra sensitive\' heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I\'m not \'paying attention\'. Even though the other models had an \'indicator\' (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn\'t really enough to get my attention so I didn\'t reduce the pressure.When I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light - it\'s *really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall. (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom). But, the \'brake light\' was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and the light now only goes on every once in a while.They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing. This toothbrush with its \'brake light\' feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums & your teeth, and in turn, your health & well-being!PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, & healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon). I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)"

But by keeping the brush on its stand with the charging cord plugged in I should have maximum power for each brushing.  The instructions that come with the brush say you can leave it plugged in, but recommend that every 6 months you let the battery deplete itself.Like another reviewer, I have sensitive teeth and prefer a soft brush.  The brush head that came with the brush seemed to work just fine for me.  The test will be when I have my next visit to the dentist and learn whether there has been an increase in gum erosion since the last visit.  However, just based on short time use, I have no reason to think there will be a problem.  My brushing includes running the brush over my tongue and the bristles feel no different than my other brushThe brush heads that I used on the previous brush don\'t work on this, but the literature that comes with the brush describes 5 different heads that do.  Quite an interesting variety, including floss action, precision clean, white+clean, and sensitive clean.As is true of most electric toothbrushes, heads are pricey if purchased from a local stored.  Amazon sells them at a heavily discounted price, so it is a good place to buy head replacements.  What I do and recommend that others do is to buy a supply of brushes at a time in order to get the best price and insure you have enough on hand to replace a head every 3 months if used twice a day.  The per head price is cheaper if you buy a pack of 6 heads than if you buy the standard 3 pack.  Amazon has both."

Some items to note of my fakes:- Had the right packaging, but it printing was blurry on the back. It\'s hard to tell from the picture, but the text and graphics were noticeably fuzzy.- The logo did not scratch-off and there was an engraved serial number- The package only had 1 ring- Bristles were noticeably sloppy, particularly when compared to the real thing- There was blue dye leaking onto the yellow pieceOverall, these fakes were slightly better than some of the previous fakes people posted, but still fake nonetheless."

Oral-B Power Tip Replacement Brush Head, 1 count these were exactly what I was looking for and expected. Our transaction went off without a hitch! I would use this vendor anytime as actions speak much louder than words.Excellent A +++ Thank you, Jeff"
2133,2183,20110318,B002HWS9GG,5,"March 18, 2011",AW7BGAR3VSIY5,Great Toothbrush,"I bought the Oral-B 5000 brush after doing extensive research. This was my first electric or powered toothbrush. I will not compare it with Philips Sonicare as both are excellent brushes. I went with oral-b as I prefer a rotatory brush over a one that just moves up and down. If like me you are new to electric toothbrush and are wondering if it will be too harsh on your teeth and gums, then I can assure you that I found this oral-b 5000 very gentle. If fact, I would have preferred if it had a little bit more power. I have healthy teeth and gums so for someone who has very sensitive teeth this might be an issue. This brush however has a sensitive mode which reduces the power considerably so you can still go with it.The oral-b 5000 box came with a brush handle (oral-b trimph), 2 brush heads (1 flossaction. 1 prowhite), a smart guide, traveling case, a charging station (charging ring + brushhead storage stand) and a smart plug. An important note: only the oral-b 5000 and 4000 series come with a smart plug (100-240 V) adapter. Others 3000 and lower versions just work for US voltage only and you will need to buy a voltage converter if you want to travel with it. You can tell by looking at the pictures on the outside of the box. Smart plug is bigger as it has voltage conversion circuitry inside it, the other one is just an electric plug. Since I travel frequently, so this was very important to me and thus my choice was limited to 4000 or 5000 series only.Difference between the 4000 and 5000 is that 5000 has a smart guide and the charging station that has a place to store 4 extra brush heads, plus 5000 has one extra mode of operation. Other than that both are identical. The smart guide is not essential for brushing. It just shows you various information like the brushing mode you are using, total brush time, low battery indicator, over pressure warning. It also similes and winks at you! I find it convenient as all the information is in front of me, and if I wanted to change my brushing mode, I do not need to take the toothbrush out of my mouth. The toothbrush always starts in the daily clean mode and you cannot turn it on outside your mouth, as it then sprays toothpaste all over the counter and sink, so if it was not for the smart guide, you will find it very difficult to select the desired brushing mode on the toothbrush.The brush handle and brush heads are made in Germany. They appear well-constructed. The brush handle is water proof and factory sealed against moisture. This is very important as otherwise the moisture will ruin the battery and the circuitry inside, a common problem with electric brushes powered with replaceable AA batteries. The toothbrush is charged through magnetic induction, so it is safe to put the charging station on the bathroom counter, near water. Brush heads are easy to clean and replace. In fact, more than 1 person can use the brush handle, as the only thing that goes into the mouth is the brush head and each person can use their own brush head. The brush heads come with their own colored rings, so you cannot mix your brush head with someone else. The battery life is good and with my typical brushing time of 4-5 minutes twice a day, it lasts for 4-5 days.Finally, about the price. I got the 50% off offer, so the 5000 ended up costing me about $65. It was an excellent deal for me. Is this brush worth $159? Well, I would have to say no. If you can get it for below $100 then it is an excellent deal. Is it better than a manual toothbrush? I would have to say yes! It is 200% better than a manual toothbrush. In fact, after using this you will wonder why you did not switch before.Now, if the brush handle lasts for 3 years and each brush head lasts for at least 5 months, then I will be satisfied with my $65 down payment on this toothbrush.I hope my review was useful. I have tried to concentrate on information I did not find in other reviews. If anyone needs additional information just write a comment on this review and I will respond."

However, I would not advise keeping it a long time. I have owned two of these and I can\'t for the life of me figure out why, but it develops a terrible odor within months. I clean it regularly with rubbing alcohol, soap & water, and keep it dry, as well as changing the brush heads routinely, but nothing seems to stop the odor from happening. In the short term, this seemed like a great, value priced electric toothbrush, but once that odor begins (and it could be as soon as a couple months), I would advise throwing it away because there\'s no getting rid of it. For a three month electric toothbrush, there are much better values out there."

Recently it was time to order a new supply and I noticed that they had changed the name of the product to \'Extra Gentle\'. Seeing that they were still saying this was for canker sore sufferers I bought several tubes. Almost immediately after I started using this product I had one canker sore after another. I then changed to another SLS free brand and everything has healed up and is back to normal. My thoughts are that either this new product is worthless for preventing canker sores or I got a bad batch that had SLS in it. Attempts to contact the company through the \'contact us\' section of their web site have failed. I guess I\'ll be throwing away several tubes of this not inexpensive toothpaste.1/22 Edit - A few days after posting this review Rembrandt responded to my complaint to them about this product. We\'re in the process of returning the toothpaste for coupons for other Rembrandt products. Better that throwing them away I suppose.

2350,2405,20101008,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 8, 2010",AIY2GUK4HEMMU,Very Pleased,"First off this is my first automatic toothbrush, so take what I review about the toothbrush with a grain of salt.I decided to buy this only because there is a 50% rebate from Oral-B with the purchase.  Normally I wouldn\'t buy a toothbrush for $100, but in a few weeks when I get $50 back, it will justify me spending $50, even though that seems a little steep for a toothbrush.  But nevertheless, its a steal of a deal right now.So onto the product. Overall I am very pleased with it.  My teeth felt amazingly smooth and clean after the first brushing.Since I\'m not an automatic toothbrush guru, I am not sure of the sizes and noise of others.  In my own opinion, I feel like it is a tad heavy and large.  But once again, its got a motor and battery in it unlike my manual toothbrush.I read other reviews about the base of the unit and storage compartment for the brush heads being too large.  I however have to disagree with that.  The base unit is just larger than the base of the toothbrush, as the toothbrush sits in it to charge.  The storage part holds 4 tips and snaps to the base.  Once again, I don\'t know how others compare, but to me the size of it seems perfect for my counter space (about 8 sq ft).The plug however seems large.  But oh well, I\'m also not an electrician so I don\'t know why it needs to be that big.The Wireless Smartguide is pretty cool as well.  It gives you a timer and choice of count up or count down modes and a ingenious idea of having 4 zones (for each section of teeth).  This 4 zone thing blinks for 30 seconds indicating which zone you should be brushing in and provides a visual timer of when to move on.  It makes it idiot proof for brushing for the correct time.  I find myself brushing for about 4 minutes because the 2 minutes fly by which is a plus to the health of my teeth and gums.I am really impressed with the \'extras\'.  Really, when you buy electronics you ALWAYS need to get your own batteries for it.  With this, the Wireless Smartguide came with 2 AA batteries in it, as well as 2 more.  4 batteries!!! You never get batteries included let alone EXTRA batteries.  Ha, needless to say, that\'s coll Oral-B.  You also get 2 brushing heads, the normal flossification head and the pro-white head.  That\'s another plus with getting another brush head included in the package.  You also get the travel case.  Which I haven\'t used yet, but still cool.I have read others complain of the \'roughness\' of the brushing.  The manual does state that it can take time for your teeth to become used to the brush and your gums may bleed some.  I however had no problems gum bleeding or feeling like the toothbrush was too rough.The only negative I can say about this toothbrush is sometimes while brushing the chewing surfaces of my teeth, the back of the brush head hits the opposite chewing surface.  It doesn\'t hurt, but it doesn\'t feel great either.  Guess I just need to remember and learn to keep my mouth open more while brushing.All in all, great product and would definitely recommend to my family and friends during the promotion period where you get 50% back.  Can\'t wait for my rebate check!"

I wasn\'t sure if a hundred dollar toothbrush was for me, as I was in the practice of using a regular toothbrush for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time (while I surfed the net, usually), so I thought I was doing ok.  Let me tell you, this Oral-B feels AWESOME and it really makes my mouth feel cleaner in a shorter period of time!  I tried using my old toothbrush again, just to see, and it didn\'t feel right.  I\'ll never go back!!I usually use the regular (30 seconds per quadrant) clean in the morning and the extended (45 seconds per quadrant) clean at night.  After the last alert goes off I usually spend about another minute or so hitting the tongue, roof and cheeks, as well as a quick run around the base of the teeth and gums.  Feels great!As far as cleaning the brush, I let it run for a little under running water, then I remove the brush head and rinse the inside.  I then dry both using a towel, then keep them separate to air-dry a little more.  So far that keeps me from worrying about stuff growing inside or anything like that."

This toothbrush wowed me from the moment that I took it out of the box. First I have to point out that it comes FULLY CHARGED. Since when does an electronic item arrive at your door without needing charging? I was able to take it out and to use it immediately! The next thing I noticed was how much lighter it was than my three year old sonic toothbrush. It was more slender, shorter, and much, much more comfortable to hold. When I pulled the base out of the box I was simply astounded - how could something so small be a charger? I\'d been used to this huge base and now all I had to deal with was this tiny little thing, barely big enough to fit the base of the brush, but it did and it was extremely sturdy as well.The big challenge, though, was the brushing. My Vitality had a 2 minute warning feature on it, where it sort of stutters in the vibrations when two minutes is up. I loaded up the toothbrush with toothpaste and started the brushing. I could immediately notice the difference from my new Oral-b to my old sonic toothbrush, as this one rotated instead of just going up and down. I could simply gently guide the brush from one tooth to another, just like my dentist does, and the teeth were getting cleaned!Two minutes actually took much longer than I thought, and I was a bit ashamed to realize that I hadn\'t been brushing a whole two minutes for quite awhile! But eventually the stuttering happened and I turned off the brush and looked closely to see what the cleaning had done.WOW. Not only did the brush get in between a lot of my teeth to get some things that would normally be gotten by flossing, but it also polished my teeth as well! I was able to run my tongue around my teeth and was shocked to realize that my teeth felt exactly the same way after my home cleaning as it does after I\'m done a visit at the dentists.I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and am interested in the different heads that you can get to go on the toothbrush!

I Love This Toothbrush!!,"I have sensitive teeth and gums and I have tried a lot of different toothbrushes- electric and regular brushes. A lot of the electric toothbrushes I have tried have left my gums red and irritated, so I stop using them after the first use.I was actually excited to try the Oral B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush.This works really good! I have been using it for all my brushings (at least 2 times a day) for the past few days and it does not hurt or irritate my teeth or gums in the slightest- so needless to say this is a keeper!The bristles are really working hard getting between the teeth and removing all the food particles and debris. The top part of the brush goes in circles and the lower part of the brush goes up and down and really gets in there-- and without irritating!The timer is great also! Sometimes I feel like I am rushing when I brush my teeth, but with the built in 2 minute timer, I know that I am not exactly rushing through and well, its doing a great job in those 2 minutes.I am not finding any left over food when I floss afterwards either which really shows that this toothbrush is doing its job.Also, since this is rechargeable, I dont have to worry about constantly changing the battery- so that saves time and money!!There is an extra toothbrush head that I decided to use one and my husband the other one. He does not have a problem with sensitive teeth or gums. He has noticed his teeth are cleaner and he likes the timer and the charger also.We are both very pleased with this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone!"

Also, the 5000 has a separate timer that displays the time and the quadrant for brushing.  Actually, this is pretty helpful... two minutes, and I\'m done.  So far, I have used the floss action brushes with the Oral-B.  They seem to do a very thorough job of cleaning.  This toothbrush is rated number 1 by Consumer\'s and I couldn\'t be happier.

He recommended to me these following products:1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson & Johnson5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.This is the regiment he advised me to follow:1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it\'s the best time of day for using fluoride.3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \'glides\' right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \'grips\' the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it\'s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don\'t even think about it!5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don\'t have to wonder \'did I brush good enough\'. It tells you when you are done!CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  Once you get through \'the tunnel\' using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care!I wish you happy, healthy teeth!"

I\'ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  My gums also feel massaged by the vibratory scrubbing they receive, hence that just-went-to-the-dentist feeling without the paperwork, wait, or cost."

Those are shaped more like a conventional toothbrush, rectangular,rather than round like this unit.  I always thought the Cross Action did a good enough job so I never splurged on a more expensive unit.  Well, after trying the Oral-b 3000, I find I like the 3000 much better.  I have less of a tendency to \'brush\' my teeth with the 3000, and I know you aren\'t supposed to brush with an electric toothbrush, just move the brush around slowly.  Being smaller in head size, it is easier to maneuver and I feel it does a better job getting  to all the teeth surfaces.  I love the added bonus of the 30 second timer on  the 3000.  At first I thought something was wrong when every 30 seconds it would seem like the toothbrush was powering down, but it just is a timer to let you know to move on.  It has a 2 minute timer so you can focus on doing 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  How fun is that!  The red \'too much pressure\' light is also handy, and I had to push pretty hard to get to light up, such that is was uncomfortable on my teeth.  Some of you may need the warning light, but the pain was enough for me to stop the pressure.  I do like this toothbrush, but I also agree that it is costly and buying replacement heads are costly, so it is a continuing investment.  Still, these clean so much better than manual toothbrushes.  My kids have been using them for years and between the two of them they have had 1 cavity.  So perhaps these do pay for themselves in the long run."

It comes with three toothbrush heads: sensitive, floss, whitening. The sensitive brushhead one will forever remain in the closet. Really unless you have someone in your family who has different teeth from you, either you will be using the floss or the sensitive, not both, so really it comes with two brushheads, not three.2. It took me a while to read the manual, I didn\'t think it was all that clear on what I was supposed to do (I\'ve never owned one before) but it turns out that it\'s a lot easier than the manual suggests.3. I\'m not certain if the pressure signal works appropriately. After starting to use it, my teeth started to become more sensitive. Even though the timer thing didn\'t indicate I was brushing too hard, I decided to use less pressure and my teeth stopped being as sensitive.4. It doesn\'t tell me anything about usage of toothpaste.

The next size head down is a 40.The texture is SOFT, not Medium texture, and you should optfor the SOFT, rather than the Medium; the SOFT (this one) isplently firm to do the job without mushing down and wastingyour time just going through the motions without connecting.Looking at the bristles head-on (staring at the tips of thetufts, with the plastic head in the rear), the arrangementof the tufts (the pattern) is an oval. Normally I personallydo not like such an arrangement, preferring instead a solidrectangle, so as to purchase more surface area with which toconnect to the teeth and gums. In the case of the CrossAction(manual) toothbrush\'s configuration, the lack of \'corners\' tothe brush is not noticeable, unlike other oval-shaped heads.Reason for this is two-fold (am not a tech, this is personalconjecture or observation): the outer \'rim\' or border of thebrush\'s bristles is resilient (doesn\'t give easily, no mush),AND the very tip of the brush head has a special arrangementof slightly LONGER bristles (color: solid white, no bluishindicator layer) that reach v-e-r-y effectively into netherregions of the mouth (back molars?) to route out the bugs &leftover food particles. All you need is SOFT, not Medium;should you utilize a Medium (texture rating, not size) one,you\'d gouge your gums and whatever else is in there. You\'llget enough traction and friction and devil-exorcising actionwith a SOFT CrossAction (manual) toothbrush.Do not confuse the CrossAction with the Advantage series ofOral-B manual toothbrushes; although the Advantage line hasa similar appearance (shape and combination of features), Iventure to tout the CrossAction as being superior in termsof achieving results (getting one\'s teeth and gumline cleanin the least amount of time, with the minimum of dexterity).In case you DO wish to order a single Advantage toothbrushin the same order (to compare the two brushes), go to theSearch box and either type or copy/paste the Amazon ID# forthat style, which is ASIN: B0000C4KJG. Type B0000C4KJG w/othe \'ASIN:\'. That\'ll get you to the page which concerns theSKU 086736 (full head, soft). At the time of this review ittakes two cents more to total 25 bucks, to avoid shipping.The UPC/NDC (666 barcode) number is 3-00410-60639-8 for theCrossAction 60 Soft; that\'s for ONE brush. Six-pack sleeveshave a similar but different number, but you don\'t need thatto double-check the #53 CrossAction in a retail store. Whenyou wish to hunt down our brush in the haphazardly sortedretailer\'s toothbrush rack, home in on the reddish number53, located at the extreme tip of the J-hook tab at the TOPof the individual blister package. This\'ll save you gettingfrustrated or confused when rummaging through the toothbrushrack in search of WORDS. Find Oral-B and then find the 53...Amazon saves you money (per individual toothbrush) comparedto what the stores charge (about 4 smackers each), but youcan get your mitts on a sample in a retail Rx before you doorder (in case you prefer to SEE and heft what you\'ll getas a six-count from Amazon).The two downsides are- the blister packaging is not really biodegradable (tough);- the parent company is B-I-G on animal testing (laboratoryexperiments, usually redundant, on sentient rabbit eyes...).The Oral-B CrossAction style of manual toothbrush, althoughmore expensive than shlock-brand models, is well worth themonetary outlay. The squeaky-clean satifaction will SPOILyou, and you won\'t settle for a manual toothbrush of lesserquality in the future.This brush does not include the rubber bristles along theouter edge of similar toothbrushes: they are supposed tomassage your gums, but IMHO the regular CrossAction doesenough work on both the teeth and also the gumline to actas a do-it-all toothbrush (no, it does not floss!).BTW, your dentist probably never has mentioned during allthe precious moments that you have spent together THAT THEGUMS ACT AS AN O-RING GASKET SEAL between your teeth andthe jaw-bones. Maintaining the gums (such as with a brush)preserves the GUMS, which in turn will protect your teethROOTS and jawBONES from bacteria and foreign matter. Youneglect your gums when in your prime, and you\'ll reap amess of AVOIDABLE trouble with your roots and bones later.Perhaps you might even suggest to your dentist that s/hebe more proactive in making patients AWARE of the role ofthe (silent) g-u-m-s in protecting the base of out teeth!Parting comment: sugar rots teeth, but the bone particleswithIN refined sugar are the #1 cause of various cancers.This according to avatar Sathya Sai Baba, who should know."

If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It\'s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one\'s teeth during brushing.I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one\'s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.So, it\'s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs."

I just started using it and it definitely has some extra power that my old one didn\'t have.  It is a bit loud, so if you have sensitive ears, be warned of that.  It charged fast and is holding its battery power well (I don\'t charge it every time I use it).  I brush for 3 minutes and use the 30 second timers for back, top/bottom, right/left, then the extra minute for my front top and bottom... I thought I would hate the 30 second timer and find it annoying, but turns out its really handy to brush each of the areas long enough.  I haven\'t used the little clock thing as I tend to walk around as I brush, but I imagine it would be good for those adjusting to electric toothbrushes and/or kids.  I also probably won\'t use the extra brush holder as my medicine cabinet doesn\'t have the room.  The travel case will definitely come in handy and the small charger is a nice change from my old clunky one.Pros:*Great clean*30 second pauses and 2 minute longer pause*Small charger*Travel case*Should help your dentist visits!!*Pressure notification (if you are brushing too hard, it gives some warning, but I haven\'t experienced it)*Separate timer would be good for kids or those new to electronic brushesCons:*Louder than my old model*Extra stuff... not sure many people need the brush holder, only some will use the separate timer*New heads are expensive"

1600,1641,20080904,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 4, 2008",A3FXT4UPI30K7S,Absolute Must-Have Excellent Travel Size Sonic Toothbrush,"The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush far surpassed my expectations in terms of size, weight, sturdiness, quietness and functionality for a sonic toothbrush. Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week\'s time, in my case of twice daily use. While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful! Not only is this toothbrush built for home use, it\'s the one you won\'t want to be without wherever you go.I especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I\'m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds. The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who\'ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have... yet I found I can get used to the sonic sensations, and I even feel that my gums and teeth are gaining strength, cleanliness and overall health. Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.So just how compact is this toothbrush? At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one\'s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing. The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth. The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.The directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I\'ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do). Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question. This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush I don\'t want to live without!  Highly, highly recommended."

The sealed box came with one FlossAction brush head.The handle I received says, \'TRIUMPH Professional Care\' and has the green charge lights on a gray background. It is NOT the digital display. My first guess is that this is the older model but some reviewers said they called Oral-B and were told the handles with a non-digital display (like mine) are the newest model, so I\'m not sure. I\'m also not sure if there are any improvements with a newer model - other than the display - that would make me want to be sure and have the newer model? I noticed that Amazon sales of the 4000 model are temporarily on hold while they investigate what appears to be the same issue.For now, I am happy and content with what I have. If anyone knows or learns more about this issue please let us know! The toothbrush seems excellent!Update: After reading through the model 5000 reviews going back to 2009, I now think that mine is a newer model afterall. Originally, they came with a 110/220 volt power adapter with the electronics built into the AC plug which made the plug that goes into the AC outlet overly large (some reviewers complained about the large plug). Mine has just a small basic 2-prong AC plug. Mine is 110 volt only and the electronics are in the charging base where the brush handle sits. Older units came with 2 or 3 brush heads. Mine came with only 1. So, it appears that Oral-B decided to cut some costs by removing the dual voltage and 1 or 2 extra brush heads. They also decided to change the LCD handle display to LED. Hopefully, they also added some improvements?! I\'m still happy."

Upon brushing, it creates a back-and-forth spinning motion and a vibration that is akin to the polishing machine at the dentist\'s office.  There is no doubt that it is superior to traditional brushing in terms of effort to brush and how clean your teeth and mouth feel.  Given the relatively low-price, this could be an excellent option for some.However, I\'m a regular user of the Sonicare (I use the slightly older Elite series), and I can say that I prefer the Sonicare.  After several days of switching back and forth, it was clear to me that the Sonicare is simply better at brushing between teeth and getting the mouth to a clean feeling while being more gentle.  The Oral-B feels more like a polishing experience, whereas the Sonicare seems to get deeper between the teeth and gums and really get things clean.That being said, in reading the literature, it seems that the Oral-B products--at least the Professional Series--are superior to the Sonicare in terms of cleaning plaque (e.g., Biesbrock AR, Walters PA, Bartizek RD, Goyal CR, Qaqish JG. Plaque removal efficacy of an advanced rotation-oscillation power toothbrush versus a new sonic toothbrush. Am J Dent. 2008 Jun;21(3):185-8.).  I found this very interesting.  What I am not sure of, however, is whether or not this lower-priced Vitality line is the same as the more expensive professional series, and if not, how it differs.In sum, this is an excellent electric toothbrush that seems best suited for cleaning the surfaces of teeth extremely well.  I found it to be a little bit rougher and a little less capable of cleaning between the teeth and gums as the Sonicare (which has a larger head, softer bristles, and creates sort of a deep foaming feeling between the teeth).  Still, recommended indeed."

In other words, not in hard plastic that had to be cut.  I have had it for only three days, so cannot evaluate the battery life, etc.  The toothbrush does a good job.  It is quick and thorough.  Two minutes go by in a flash and my teeth feel clean, even cleaner than some cleanings I have had in the dentist\'s office.The timer was very difficult to open.  There are two pieces of plastic covering the battery. Instead of sliding the top cover one has to press and raise it off the appliance.  (If this sounds confusing, it is.)  The second cover slides off.All things considered, I think I will be very happy with this toothbrush.  Did a lot of research before I bought it because the last electric toothbrush I had left a lot to be desired.  This is a winner.UPDATE:  I\'ve had this toothbrush for 6 months.  3.31.11 I noticed a yellow, sticky residue on the charger that appears to be oozing from the bottom of the handle.

2472,2530,20120116,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 16, 2012",A1PM1NSMCOWG88,It will \'Take Your Breath Away!!!\',"Once in a while a product comes along that lives up to its hype and acclaim; thereby satisfying ones anticipated expectations. And then, there is the rare product that comes along which goes beyoyond the hype and acclaim. And which exceeds all expectations. Allow me to introduce to you the latter, the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush. I will not take up too much time by reiterating all the 5-star reviews. But do read these reviews; because they are right on the money. One review in particular claimed how using this product cured his bad breath problem. This claim really got my attention. I too suffered from bad breath. And no amount of brushing or tongue scraping would solve the problem of bad breath. So this claim along with many of the other positive reviews persuaded me to give the Oral-B a try. Results...Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Upon initial use it felt like I had been to the dentist office for a dental cleaning (and like so every time after use). And yes...no more bad breath...simply amazing!  Is the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush worth the price? Consider the convenience of getting a truly professional dental cleaning (at home) without having to go to a Dental Hygienist. Also, consider the cost involved of going to a dental hygienist for cleaning every six months or so. The Oral-B is worth the price many many many times over.  Note: If you have not had cleaning for a while (or not good cleaning), you may experience slight bleeding of the gums for a couple of weeks of use. As the toothbrush rids your dentals of the old and new trapped food particles (which will turn to plaque via bacteria if not cleaned of), you will experience bleeding less and less until no more. Be advised, the sticker that attaches the timer/clock to a surface, like a wall, is of industrial strength. When it sticks it stays sticked. You may pull away some of your wall, or other used surface, if you try to remove it after sticking it on. Like me, you may choose not to use sticker and just place timer/clock on sink counter-top (or a stand for eye level). However, I now use the timer/clock as a bathroom clock mostly. Because the the Oral-B toothbrush device also has a built-in timer guide. The quadrant cleaning method illustrated in the user manual seemed a bit tedious for me. I have developed a more desirable method for myself. This procedure is as follows: starting from the top chop going left outer...moving to back then going inner around to other side until at that back then around that outer side to where I started (spending a second or two on each tooth). And likewise with my bottom chop. Time-wise, the whole procedure takes around two minutes or so. You can follow the user manual guide or develop your own strategy. The main thing is to make sure that you reach all tooth and gum areas (top and bottom chops; inner and outer surfaces, and top of dentals).  Now then! How quickly should you get the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush? Don\'t walk. Don\'t skip or hop! Don\'t even run!! But warp-speed!!! And seek a desirable  merchant to acquire this dental magician."

They initially entered the market using very different technologies: ultrasonic vibration for Sonicare, rotary brushes for Oral-B.Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces. They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task. The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges. At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B\'s rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.Sonicare\'s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system. The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled. These brushes are sold under the FlexCare moniker.After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare. I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare\'s. I don\'t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied. This may actually be a good thing since you\'re supposed to only apply it gently.Oral-B includes a feature similar to what Sonicare calls the \'quad-pacer,\' essentially a timer that signals you when it\'s time to switch quadrants (every 30 seconds)Battery life is about a week.Included in the package: brush, charging stand, bonus interstitial brush... but no travel case.PROS----- a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets- very low price for this technology- easy to clean- small charging stand- small brush, great for little hands- quad pacer- setting for sensitive gumsCONS----- may be too small for some hands- charger is 110V only (you need a transformer, not just an adapter, to use it overseas)- no travel caseCONCLUSION----------Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes. At less than half the price of the cheapest FlexCare, the Pulsonic is worthy of your consideration. Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don\'t move the brush back and forth, don\'t push hard: just hold it in place and let it do its job. You will get the best results if you rinse with Listerine and floss before brushing."

The toothbrush came with 2 heads, and it took a while to charge (I didn\'t see the battery light at first so I was worried).

So when I first turned it on, I was afraid as it sounds like a dentist\'s drill!  However, I soon adjusted and am now quite the fan.  It comes with a two minute timer which sort of stutters when the time is up.  And with this gadget those two minutes I have found simply fly by.  What I most like, though, is that this toothbrush really does seem to get in deep between all the nooks and crannies and cleanse my teeth very well.  I also like that I\'m able to reach back and even brush my wisdom teeth and get them clean.  Something I couldn\'t do with a manual toothbrush.  Since this is my first electric toothbrush I had to learn to adjust also to the fact that I don\'t have to press down hard and push like with a manual toothbrush.  This one really does the work for you.  And I have found it best to let it linger some on each tooth.  And the results are that my teeth really do look and feel clean.  I\'m quite pleased with this gadget and I do very much recommend it.  It comes with a replacement toothbrush head as well, however, you have to figure out a way to store it on your own.  As it doesn\'t come enclosed in any type of case or anything like that.  I currently have mine wrapped in a paper towel.  Overall, though, I am most pleased and happy with this toothbrush.P.S.  After using this product for more weeks I\'ve discovered fine lines creeping in on the edges of my lips.  I noticed that with this toothbrush the toothpaste seems to gather there and I think the toothpaste was burning my skin.  I have very sensitive skin.

I have read some other reviews comparing this to the next model up and one of the  major differences is that the charging station and the tooth brush have the indicator light but as long as you brush in front of the mirror you can see the light on the toothbrush and if you aren\'t brushing in front of the mirror you wouldnt see the light on the base either unless you don\'t have a mirror over you sink or don\'t have your toothbrush at your sink, neither of which makes much sense!

Check the Oral-B website for a $[...] rebate through June 2010!Included in the box is a pro-white brush (in addition to the floss-action), a charger and covered compartment for the brush heads, a nice travel case for the base, and extra batteries for the smartguide. There is adhesive tape for mounting the smartguide on a wall or mirror, but the smartguide sits nicely on the bathroom counter as well. I like the smartguide and its dual function as a bathroom clock. Very cool. It also keeps me on track as I brush.As other reviewers have noted, the battery cover on the smartguide is somewhat difficult to remove, and you have to take it off to access the buttons to set the clock. The plug on the charger is also rather large and takes up a chunk of space on the bathroom counter.  These are small annoyances, though.
