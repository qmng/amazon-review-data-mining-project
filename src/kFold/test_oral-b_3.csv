Following the directions and using as suggested, has shown results for me."

The Brush ocillates to provide an excllent cleaner. It is really effective on removing placque from the teeth. It also leave teeth with a very clean feel. I recommend this brush if you are looking for a very effective Power Tooth Brush. You will get your money\'s worth.
1933,1978,20120501,B002HWS9GG,2,"May 1, 2012",A2TH8PVFE0MPW6,Not reliable with bad customer support,"We bought this toothbrush as a replacement for Sonicare. The problem with Sonicare was durability (that was less than 2 years on average) and high cost. But I should say that when (once) it died during first year, it took one phone call to get replacement.Oral-B looked better per reviews and also it had cheaper replacement heads. So, we decided to give a try.As a toothbrush, it works differently from Sonicare and at the beginning we liked it quite more. But after a while, I\'m not sure which one I like more. In either case, it does job done. I would not suggest buying the fancy timer though.However, this one died in a half a year. By itself, one sample is not a statistic. But customer support was quite less friendly and we had to ship the toothbrush with papers for \'repair\'. At the end, we\'ve got a new one - but is was much more painful.Bottom line: I would rate the toothbrush about the same as Sonicare, quite worth customer support and (so far) same poor reliability. If this one will die within next year or two, I probably will switch back to Phillips."

I can see and feel the cleaniness as well as my teeth being whiter without doing anything other than brushing.The cost is worth every penny.Yes! I\'m recommending to all my friends and anyone else who wants listen."

I bough mine at least 8 years ago as a travel brush because I use the more expensive rechargeable Oral-B brushes at home.Pros.1 It does an excellent job at cleaning your teeth.2 The battery lasts for a very long time (about a year).3 I don\'t have to worry about chargers (chargers use energy and also cost a certain amount).4 It is so inexpensive and efficient that I don\'t worry about the cost of replacement AA batteries.5 If mine ever breaks I would not hesitate go and buy a couple more.

It started out normal but then it slowed down or stopped very easily while brushing.  At first, I thought it was low battery but this issue didn\'t improve after I replaced the battery.  It\'s very poor performance.  I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger and last very long time (now they no longer make this model).  One difference I could find is that the good one was made in Germany and poor one was made in China.  I am not saying this is the reason but I am certainly recommending don\'t buy this model if anyone is considering.  I will give this a rating of zero star if that\'s an option."

Initially I didn\'t like it much because I was still used to the old style brush. But after using it for couple of months I can see the difference. My teeth have stopped bleeding and I am so satisfied with this product at this price.

I tried the floss brush and happily noticed that after my dental cleaning the usual staining of my teeth that happens over time never happened. Those little rubber paddles must be removing the stains before they start! Fantastic!For me, this is a very powerful whitening brush.Caveat: You must still floss. No brush replaces flossing."

460,468,20110130,B0002KHTG6,4,"January 30, 2011",AO4X5NB7KBTN3,Before and After Results,"I was somewhat skeptical of this product, so I took before and after pictures of my teeth to see what realistic results I had achieved.  I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  I brush twice a day, on and off with Seonsodyne Whitenting and Sensodyne Pronamel. I also ensured that I used the \'Whitening\' brush setting that the toothbrush offers. Between the two photos, I noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not very much.  My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  So I\'d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  It would probably be nice to have it your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don\'t expect too much.  It might be somewhat of a gimmick that it \'whitens\' teeth, but if you look at what the item is called--Pro White, it is designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth and make them a little whiter.  SO in all fairness, I\'d say that it works as it should without huge results that people may expect of it."

I decided to try it again thinking that improved technology might make it bearable.  This one comes with atimer so you know how long you brush each quadrant of your mouth.  Two minutes is what is recommended by dentist, I can go over 4 minutes and longer when I have time.  My teeth feel so clean and appear whiter after each use.  Ihave only been using it for a week but have no plans on giving it up any time soon.:-) I would definitely recommendthis product!"

Yes, it has two settings but, it shouldn\'t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn\'t have to with their older model. The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting. There is also no indication that it is fully charged except by plugging it in when uncharged and timing it.  The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  I\'m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  I am now \'cost sensitive\' as I am only willing to spend so much to \'rent\' a unit for a couple of years (my older one lasted on the lower side of this equation) only to have to throw it and the useless, spare, brand new brushes I have away (it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit\'s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.On the plus side, it is very slim so it fits nicely in the hand and, I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once so, I suppose that jackhammer feeling of the brush obviously did not do any harm to the enamel as I had feared it would."

I have tried larger brush heads and they don\'t even begin to fit and clean but this small, round, brushhead fits perfectly and cleans thoroughly.

Once I was finally able to contact them, the seller fixed the problem in a timely manner going out of their way to make sure that everything was done correctly.  The brushes arrived in perfect shape much more quickly than expected.  I would buy from this seller again and give them 5 stars.Dec update: I wish this came in an actual 4 pack. I can\'t use the one that is supposed to clean between your teeth as I don\'t have that much space between my teeth so that one is wasted on me. I\'d rather they had a pack of brushes and a pack of those so that we could purchase only what we actually need.  The brushes however, while harder than I am used to are color coded so that the head can be switched for multiple people to use.  The thing to remember about brushing with these is what I keep in my head every single time, let the brush do the work, otherwise you will be brushing too hard and hurt the enamel on your teeth.  What I really wish is, that I could use the oral b sonic complete brushes with this brush handle, I don\'t understand why they make different brush heads for each of their sonic toothbrushes or barring that, they would actually be consistent in their brusheads, these really should be softer."

Then I tried this DualAction brush head, and loved it even more in about 3 seconds.  Still do.  In fact, I recently ordered 5 of the 3-packs all at once because I\'ve had trouble finding them in stores and I was afraid they would stop making them or change the design.Now, it is true that at first it feels like you\'ve put one of those power floor scrubbers in your mouth, in that it feels kinda big and industrial until you\'re used to it.  But boy does it make your teeth and gums feel cleaner.  And I was accustomed to the different feel by the end of my first brushing with it.  If that sounds potentially troubling to you, I recommend just buying a one-pack the first time.  It\'s not cheap, after all, but for me it\'s been well worth the cost.  Do try it.I should also note that when I mentioned to my dentist that I\'ve been using this, she referred to it as a \'business killer.\'  I take that as another good sign."

They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft. Also, the \'floss action\' plastic tips around the perimeter don\'t really seem to be flossing more than they are just contributing to the roughness of the overall brushing experience.

I got a set of sensitive heads because I have sensitive gums and never tried the other heads.  I like the sensitive heads.  Between flossing and brushing with this thing, my teeth feel almost as clean as walking out of a dentist office.  I used to see plaque build-up between visits behind my lower incisors.  This brush manages to clean that plaque away.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  In the past, I\'d occasionally see bleeding gums while flossing.  I haven\'t seen that recently.The toothbrush felt funny to use at first.  My teeth felt like they were \'buzzing\' a little after brushing.  I don\'t notice that any more.  The handle feels bulky, but I\'m able to maneuver it fine now and I can certainly clean more tooth surfaces with this brush than my old non-electric brush.  What\'s nice is that you simply have to position the brush properly and it vibrates to perform the cleaning.  I like the wireless timer that guides me through brushing 30 seconds in each quadrant.Set-up could have been easier.  Instructions were so-so and removing the back cover of the clock/timer was more difficult than it should have been.  But, day-to-day use is easy and rewarding.After using for 6 months, the wireless display became very finicky over batteries.  It goes haywire if the battery isn\'t fully charged.  The first set of batteries lasted 6 months.  I replaced with fresh energizers; they lasted only two months.  I checked the energizers with my multimeter and they register solidly in the \'good\' range---the batteries are fine."

I gave the Floss Action heads a try using the Oral B Vitality motor unit and thought the Floss Action heads weren\'t very good. About a year later, I put the same Floss Action head on an Oral B Smart Series 5000 and it was totally different. I\'d definitely buy the Floss Action heads in the future.The Floss Action heads are similar to the standard Precision heads, but have 4 extra rubber paddles for \'flossing action\'  or removing some stains. With the Vitality brush, the RPMs weren\'t fast enough or the oscillating action was slightly off causing the Floss Action heads to hurt my gums a little. They acted more like bumpers than anything else. With the Oral B 5000, the RPM seemed faster and smoother, and the Floss Action heads felt the same as the Precision heads.I normally floss before brushing, so I cannot comment on whether the Floss Action heads can replace the act of flossing. I still recommend following your hygienist\'s recommendations, which is usually to floss before brushing.It works well at cleaning my teeth, and it is compatible with most Oral B brush motors. However, I recommend you buy an updated unit and not try to use the Floss Action on a Vitality, low-end model, or something made a decade ago. The 4 extra paddles don\'t feel like they\'re doing anything, but I can see them oscillating on my teeth and gums.Overall: 4/5 stars"

I got it about a year ago from my dentist\'s office, and absolutely love it.  The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...the savings is very significant!).I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn\'t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it\'s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren\'t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don\'t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)"

Your Oral B toothbrush was meant to be used with Oral B heads. The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand. As far as the advertised \'Pro White\', I cannot attest to that. I seem to highly doubt that just by using a different head that you\'re teeth are magically gonna become whiter.

Then I could alter the behavior so that the timer takes into account that I need time to rearm the brush with toothpaste between sides.  I could also adjust the timer so that it tells me to switch quadrants after each minute rather than 30 seconds.  Heck, I could do a whole bunch of useful things with the timer unit if I could install my own apps on it.  Definitely a wasted opportunity as the timer unit is only good for maintaining discipline and encouraging kids as it is now.Still, this is a fine product."

To be on the safe side, I charged it for the full 16-hr recommended charge time before initial use.  It comes with two identical interchangeable brush heads.  I plan to have my two young children use the brush, however, the brushes are identical, with no markings to distinguish them, so I marked one brush at the base with a permanent marker to indicate the difference.  The brushing action is robust and does a good job of scrubbing tooth surfaces.  There is no need for additional pressure or manual brush strokes.  The brush has a built-in timer and makes a stuttering sound after you have brushed for two minutes.  My kids enjoy the brush and don\'t find it overly harsh or difficult to use.  I was quite pleased with the results and feel it does a better job than relying on them to properly use the manual brush.  The two-minute timer also makes sure they brush for a sufficient duration.  We\'re approaching two weeks of use without a recharge.  That\'s pretty good battery life, considering it\'s used twice a day by two people.  So it\'s a pretty good brush, especially if you have kids or don\'t want to spend a fortune on one of the fancier more expensive power toothbrushes."

The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference is in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. I personally wouldn\'t buy from Amazon because it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off may be similar in quality.I bought several different brush heads from Amazon this Christmas, and all appear to be fakes.

I love that it times the brushing for you, 30 seconds per quadrant, so you do a thorough job.  Last week I went back to the dentist for my 6-month followup, now 9 months pregnant, and anticipating the worst - but it was the best check up I\'ve ever had.  The cleaning was a breeze - I had hardly any buildup and everything looked great.

Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don\'t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don\'t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don\'t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.

While I agree with those who would like to have a travel case, this brush fits easily into a plastic sandwich bag.  Overall a great purchase experience and a very good product so far.

Well, my brushing habits and checkups slipped over the years and that left me with alot of bad teeth and plaque buildup.I now get regular dental care and try my best to keep my teeth looking their best. that\'s where this product comes into play.the design is wonderful. simply place toothpaste on the replaceable head and brush all your teeth including your gumline. you will get the feeling that you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. this gets deep into every nook and cranny of your mouth. it really works and stregthens your gums, and if you floss regularly your gums will no longer bleed when brushing.battery life is mediocre, sometimes lasting a a month or longer depending on frequency of use. i use mine roughly 3 times a day and i get about 5 weeks out of  a standard raovac AA battery. which to me, is acceptable.don\'t not press down to hard when brushing, this will cause the head to wear out faster than need be, and it will fray very easily if you use alot of pressure. just go ahead put some toothpaste on the head and play your favorite 3 minute song, and you will be on your way to better oral health. the benefits from switching from manual toothbrushes to this one have been enormous! my dentist actually commented on how clean my teeth were.this is a cheaper alternative to paying 60, 70, or 80 bucks for the higher end models. replacement heads are a little more expensive than normal manual toothbrushes but having cleaner teeth was a sacrifice i was willing to make.an overall great product. good alternative to more expensive brands. way to go oral b!"

With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh. The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline. It\'s not a substitute for flossing, but an additional help. My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven\'t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power. If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better. I\'m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea).

They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you\'ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn\'t work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife\'s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you\'re used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I\'m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn\'t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I\'ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I\'m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit."

I thought it was okay, until I tried this one. This is a fabulous brush.Pros:1. Rechargeable battery. Not likely to lose juice any time soon-just make sure you charge it for 12 hours before use.2. Small handle. It\'s not much bigger around than a regular toothbrush, especially when compared to the monster I\'ve been using. The charger is compact, too, and doesn\'t take up much room on my counter.3. Compact head. Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.4. Soft bristles.5. Vibrates rather than spinning. The spinning kind really chewed up my gums. This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations. Went away as soon as the brush was off.6. Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth. I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore. I don\'t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.7. Stops briefly to let you know when it\'s time to switch \'quadrants.\' (You\'re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.) When the maximum 2 minutes has elapsed, the brush gives a double signal.8. There is a precision attachment to get between teeth and into dental work.9. Does a fantastic job. My teeth are very clean.Cons:A bit louder than I expected, but certainly better than the SpinBrush, and the vibrating tickled my jaw. Hardly worth mentioning, though.I am incredibly pleased with this product. I would definitely buy this again and will recommend it to all my family members."

I also love the display that shows how much time is left and whether you are brushing too hard.  My only complaint is that the battery has deteriorated greatly after only a year.  I conditioned the battery properly, so this really shouldn\'t have happened.  The battery cannot be easily replaced, hence the full brush disposal instructions they give you.  I don\'t consider a $100 toothbrush a yearly disposable item, but I guess oral-b does.  Still, the clean teeth feeling is worth it."

2416,2472,20100603,B002HWS9GG,3,"June 3, 2010",A1T50IO1EMVNFH,From Sonicare to OralB,"I have been a Sonicare user for the previous 15 years. As a dentaphobe, I will always be grateful to Sonicare for keeping my mouth cavity free for my 7 year hiatus from the dentist- though to be fair, I also drank mostly water (vs. sugared drinks) and made sure to brush and floss twice daily, chewing sugarless gum throughout the day. Still, I found the Oral B a very nice upgrade for several reasons:1. NO ICKYNESS IN THE BRUSH HEAD!!! Sonicare brushes are notorious for getting all this disgusting gunk stuck up inside the brush head, leaving me with a sense of wonder about what exactly I was putting in my mouth, even after rinsing the head thoroughly in alcohol.2. Smaller brush heads. I finally feel like I am cleaning my wisdom teeth, which stick back almost to the uvula.3. Circular brush heads. Dentists always say to brush in circular motions, yet typical Sonicare brushes only go side to side.4. Using the floss-action head truly leaves less behind when I floss right after brushing.5. Another reviewer mentioned the fact Sonicare does not offer either soft bristled brushes or a sensitive mode.There were a couple downsides:1. Noise. The Oral B seems much louder, likely because the brush is moving in a circle vs. just side to side.2. Vibration Speed. One of Sonicare\'s main tenants for their brushes is that the sonic action itself gets rid of plaque/germs. The Oral B does not seem to vibrate quite as much- though flossing seems to yield fewer hangers-on, and does not just compact any recently-eaten food- such as cracker mush.There are other benefits, which Sonicare has also added to its latest greatest brushes, such as timers and better chargers. Still, I am happy with the switch- I\'ll just see if my dentist notices =)UPDATE; 2011- Going back to Sonicare.I had the brush about a year when the battery started dying ALL the time- would go from 3 of 4 bars to 0 bars in the middle of brushing. If you prefer leaving your brush plugged in all the time, this may not be a problem- but I like my batteries to hold some charge.Also, in the end, I do not feel like the brush is cleaning between the teeth as much as a Sonicare. Likely thanks to all the complainers like myself, I\'ve been exploring Amazon and noticing Sonicare has now created smaller brush heads with only the prong attachment/gotten rid of the ick factor of their bigger brush heads, and made the brushes overall less expensive (under $80).In the midst of the year\'s use, I sucked it up and returned to the dentist... to find I had 7 cavities =( While I obviously can\'t entirely blame the Oral B for this result, I again cite that the brush did not seem to clean as well between teeth/I miss the sonic action of the Sonicare- and did leave any late night cracker/chip remnants pushed down on my back teeth. So look for a new review of the latest Sonicare brush soon!"

We\'ve used Oral-B sonic for 5 years, and 5000 for 1 year.Cleanness (draw):- Both cleans well. However, they cannot remove 100% dirt from the teeth, given they use two different ways to clean. (5000 is left-right, and Sonic is up-down). It really depends on where the dirt is hiding. I would say Sonic does a better job to clean the front teeth, and 5000 does a better to job to clean the teeth in the back.Power (5000):- 5000 wins. However, it may take 1 week for your body to adjust to the strong power.Timer (5000):- 5000 comes with a timer, which is very nice.Brush head design (Sonic):- We found that the brush of 5000 wears out much faster than Sonic. I guess it has something to do with the strong power of 5000.- One thing I hate about 5000 is the brush head design. There is a hole below the brush head, which capture the toothpaste when brushing. You cannot remove it without removing the brush head. If you leave the tooth brush standing, the toothpaste inside will get out, and eventually accumulate at the bottom of the brush. This creates a round mark in our sink. To solve this problem, we need to remove the brush head and clean it completely. We didn\'t have this problem with Sonic.Battery power (Sonic)- We don\'t charge the brush until the power is completely drained. Normally, the battery of Sonic lasts about 7 days, while 5000 lasts about 3-4 days. However, it takes about 18 hours to charge Sonic, while it takes less than 12 hours to charge 5000Other uses (Sonic)- We like to use the brush head to clean the tongue. Sonic wins.Overall, we like the Sonic better."

I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use. This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED. I was initially disappointed as I realized I had a brush head that didn\'t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed. URGH... I decided to give it the weekend before trying to call customer service on Monday to get a replacement. However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions. When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean! Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush (forgot what they call it) and the fact that it continues to brush past 2 minutes. The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines. And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!! And an added bonus is that the replacement heads are even less expensive and the brush it self had a $15 rebate so less than the cheapest Sonicare too.And I\'ve only had it 4-5 days now but I am certain my teeth are already whiter than they were and less stained!!"

My teeth have never felt more clean and I am no longer having sensitivity issues. It makes me feel like I have just had a cleaning at the dental office.

I brush and floss at least once a day, maybe two if I have time.  Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.Then this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information - you find out that the brush tells you how to time your brushing.  It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  Yes, and further, the brush signals you to change.Quick reminder, after you put the toothpaste on your brush, press it to your teeth before turning it on, otherwise you get to spend some time cleaning toothpaste off the bathroom mirror, walls, and perhaps ceiling.  One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over the entire area - front, bottom, back, and gumline.  After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.  I was impressed.After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  I rinsed, and looked in the mirror.  To my surprise, I could already see a change in my teeth.  It was slight, but noticeable to me.  After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost."

I like the feeling of the oral b cleaning, but, as in all oral care, be careful not to brush too hard or you\'ll do damage to get that amazing clean feeling!"

And, since it came with more than one brush (color coded so as not to have a mix up.. ewwwww right?) I gave it a try too.  I LOVE IT.  Not only do you get a better cleaning, you get it in less time. It really is a wonderful product."

As long as I brush before I dress, or drape a towel over me while brushing, all is well, but I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve started my day by changing tops or cleaning one off before going to work."

It is light enough and simple enough for her to use without our help.I would have given it 5 stars if the tips were compatible with other Oral-B brushes (Triumph series).

I first bought this a year ago, and it\'s been sitting in my room idle for a variety of reasons.  Indifference.  Inertia.  Suspicion of its efficacy.  Fear of getting electrocuted.My dentist bothered me again during my most check-up this August, and I finally started using this electric toothbrush, and the difference between this and a regular Oral B toothbrush is night and day.Now, if you\'re an obsessive-compulsive and patient brusher, you probably don\'t need this.  As long as you hit all the spots slowly and methodically, your teeth are going to be white.  But if you happen to be like me -- impatient and erratic -- then this electric toothbrush is a godsend.I still need to cut back on the tea and fruit juices though."

2679,2749,20120305,B003UKKHB4,5,"March 5, 2012",A3O59T1B4ND0EC,Great toothbrush!,"We had a model that was a few (4?) years older and felt like it was beginning to peter out.  This new model is awesome - there are two speeds and it pauses if you push down too hard, so your teeth are really clean at the end.  The storage area is easy to keep clean too.  Definitely recommended."

I do like the Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush.  Your teeth really do feel as clean as if you just came from the dentist\'s office.  I like the 2-minute clock to keep you brushing longer. The real test will come at my next dental appointment to find out the condition of my teeth and gums.  I have only one negative comment; I can never use the first speed option as it is too fast for my sensitive teeth.  The second option speed is better for me.  Otherwise it\'s a great product!

What I wanted was replacement brushes only, the large ones, but I did not see any offered. This, I think, is more Procter & Gamble\'s fault than Amazon\'s. It is also very much a nuisance as anyone who has periodontal surgery needs something like this."
2992,3074,20100911,B003UKR67M,4,"September 11, 2010",AAKQTXS4JOUR5,Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush,"Amazon Vines review of the Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush.The product arrived timely and was packed in a small cardboard box. The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  The brushing unit is waterproof so no worry about getting water or moisture on it. There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush. The unit uses a rechargeable battery, which the company claims can not be over charged, so you can store the brushing unit on the electric charger unit.I have used both a Phillips and Oral-B electric toothbrush and find that this rechargeable model does a comparable job in the cleaning of my teeth. I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back teeth.The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth. The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums. The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off. The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.The brushing bristles give an indication by fading in color to show when it should be replaced. I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package. Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long but it looks very similar to the brushing head I have used on my Oral-B electric toothbrush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model."

Majority of vine reviewers are restlessly putting the product rating at 5 stars where as non-vine reviewers sound more pragmatic and truthful about the product ? Do vine reviewers do this in fear of loosing the free products in their mail box or what ? If this is the case, Amazon should guard this. We dont want false reviews in Amazon."

601,615,20120205,B0002KHU3I,5,"February 5, 2012",A2TN5MKODVAXP6,Great Brushheads for a great toothbrush!,"I have ordered these particular brushheads a number of timesn for use with the Oral-B Dual Clean rechargable toothbrush.  I have used this particular toothbrush for around 5 years and have stuck with it because of the great results the brush and heads yield.While others swear by higher-end brushes and/or sonic brushes, I have found that the \'clean\' I get from this brushing system is (so far) unsurpassed.  The only caveat is that the brush heads do need to be replaced once worn down; if used properly (2 minutes twice a day), they will make 3 months without issue, although some may wear them down slower/faster due to differing brush habits.All orders for this product through amazon.com have been flawless; product is exactly as described and in perfect condition.  Buy with confidence!"
