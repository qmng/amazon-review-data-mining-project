Every time I brush my teeth with this tooth brush my teeth feel extra clean. My teeth also have whitened a lot since using this product. I think I will forever use this power tooth brush, its amazing!! My dentist even noticed my teeth have gotten whiter and I actually had no cavities for the first time in three years. I usually get one but this time my teeth are actually great."

I\'ve been using the Trac II since I started shaving, about 30 or so years ago. I\'ve used every other razor there is--and there are other razors that do shave a little closer--but not for the cost of the Trac II. That\'s why it still exists after 40 years.I\'ve also tried imitations of the TracII (Personna, Walgreens, etc.), but none measure up. They tend to pull more and are not as smooth. But some seem to work for some people and they may work for you and could save you money. You just have to try them.    "

I have always purchased replacement heads at my local LARGE discount store. The price of the refill brush heads on Amazon.com compared to my \'discount\' store was at least 3/4 less in price.  I purchased 3 refill heads for a price less than 1 refill head in the discount stores. Amazing.

First off they were colored orange while the ones I get at the drugstore are blue. Secondly on the actual plastic package where the cartridges are embedded the label says Gillette Fusion while the ones I get at my drugstore colored blue says Gilette Fusion Power.In summary I don\'t think this is the real Power Fusion as it is very different than the ones you can buy at the local drugstore. I decided to try to purchase here at Amazon because of the compelling price difference after buying the Power Fusion at my drugstore ever since Gilette introduced this new product into the market.

It feels like I am smearing a layer of blobs of cream around on my body.  It leaves an oily/waxy layer, but it cleans nothing.  It\'s not \'hydrating\' -- just greasy-feeling.I guess this might possibly be OK if you had severely dry/cracked skin and don\'t want any cleaning whatsoever.  However, there are better products out there that I would use in that case such as a gentle baby product.It does have a strong, manly scent but that is about all I can say good about this Gillete Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash.

2541,2121,2197,20100919,B003987CL0,4,"September 19, 2010",A1YXEYOWESHVLJ,Great shave but expensive blades and unnecessary vibrator.,"I really didn\'t want to like this razor, the ongoing gimmickry has become increasingly annoying. However I have to admit this razor gives a really comfortable shave. The ergonomics are the best I\'ve come across, well balanced, correctly angled head, substantial weight with battery installed.  The five-blade cluster is more than just gimmickry, it provides a wider shaving area, which is more stable as you shave. The vibrating gimmick is just that, however. It seems to add nothing to the shave and it completely eliminates any tactile feedback, which I find necessary for a good shave. New blades are quite expensive, usually $3-$4 each, pretty steep but you may find the comfort of the shave is worth it (I\'m still unsure). To sum up, pass on the powered version and go with the cheaper \'manual\' version and be prepared to pay a lot for new blades.    "

Too Pricey for What it Does, Though","I have SLE and sjogren\'s (another autoimmune disease that has pretty much destroyed my salivary glands).  I do not have enough spit in my mouth, which leaves my gums fragile and my teeth prone to cavities - even in the front.  My dentist is great and is working with me to save my teeth and gums, but I have to stay on top of things.I have been using a sonicare for a couple of years.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The sonic waves sort of pummel out the junk between my teeth and loosen it up even places that the toothbrush cannot physically go.  However, that brush brutalizes my gums and the sonic action sprays stuff everywhere - my sink and mirror look like a crime scene after I brush.  The Oral-b 3000 cleans physically only - no sonic stuff, so it only gets the stuff the bristles can get to.  That amounts to teeth that are slightly less clean in spots than what I get from the other brush.  However, my gums barely bleed at all when I use this on the sensitive setting.If your main concern is gum disease, and you\'re a good flosser, I would recommend this over the sonicare, because you\'ll be able to massage your gumline without damaging good tissue.  Press the start button twice for the sensitive setting, and you\'re good to go.I deducted one star for the price point.  I think a brush this expensive ought to include sonic technology.  Sonicare has the essence for $40 less than today\'s price for the oral-b 3000,  but if you need a decent brush that will not hurt your gums, this is probably worth the added expense.  I give it an 8.5.  It cleans better than the lower-priced oral-b products - almost as well as the sonicare.  The sensitive setting is a really nice feature for people like me with fragile gums. And replacement heads are affordable - much less expensive than the sonicare."

The \'moisture strip\' makes such a difference!!!

The last time I used mousse it was the 80\'s Sebastian stuff and I was not looking to repeat a stiff, crunchy look again! My biggest worries were I didn\'t want it to smell bad, I wanted it to help hold my style through out the day, without flaking, looking stiff, and causing product buildup. At the store I smelled it, and was pleased. The next day I tried it cautiously with really no expectations at all.. boy was I surprised the smell was great. Now its been a month and I use it everyday. I don\'t use as much hairspray because this holds my style effortlessly without a sticky, lint attracting, stiff look. I would describe it as a brush able hold. "

Use of the Oral B Sonic Complete has improved the health of my gums and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  I love the feature that tells you when to switch to the next quarter of your mouth.

As women we have all probably figured out what our favorite brands are and what features we find best to suit our particular needs. I use light absorbency tampons which for some reason are rather difficult to find in retail stores, and when I do find them they are typically 2 times the price of others and there isn\'t ever a generic cheaper version. I purchased this 3 pack of 20 count tampons because there was a coupon offered at the time and with subscribe and save they ended up only being around 3 dollars a box. I have always liked the comfortable plastic applicator of the tampax \'pearl\' series, the compact style (1/2 the size of a regular applicator tampon) is such a wonderful feature, especially if carrying in your purse and they\'re small enough that you could inconspicuously tote one around in your pants pocket if need be. Just in case any of you aren\'t familiar with how the compact feature works...you remove the 1/2 sized tampon from the wrapper, hold the bottom textured part of the applicator, then simply pull out the base piece which will lock into place once completely pulled out (it aligns itself behind the cotton tampon inside) then viola you have a full sized tampon to use! Very convenient! I guess that\'s everything :) Reminder to you ladies out there...always remember to use the appropriate absorbency for your flow or you risk serious injury, even death form toxic shock. I believe they should sell light absorbency tampons more places instead of forcing women to use regular absorbency due to lack of availability...it\'s very dangerous and very serious...I had a friend that nearly died of TSS and it is a horrible thing to go through."

I\'ve tried many different brands/types but Tampax Pearl always comes out on top. The plastic applicators are much more comfortable to use than the cardboard applicators many other brands use. I love the multi-pack because I can choose which absorbancy will suit me best for that day without having to buy 3 separate boxes. I\'ve had problems with other tampons not fully opening up and absorbing like they are supposed to, but I\'ve never had a problem with these (or a leak!).

It doesn\'t weigh it down like some conditioners do. It leaves my hair manageable and removes any static electricity resulting from dry air.  I liked that it left my hair easy to comb out after washing.  My hair is below shoulder length and because of the fine texture it tends to tangle really easily.  I have to use some type of conditioner in order to comb it out without breaking it.  This Pantene Pro-v Fine conditioner made the tangles go away easily.I left the conditioner in my hair for about 3 minutes after washing and then rinsed it out with warm water.  My hair felt softer right away.  After drying, it was easy to style either using a curling iron or just blowing dry.  The conditioner had a nice light fragrance that wasn\'t overpowering.  I like that.  I also like that it gives my hair some body and height but doesn\'t make it look flat like many conditioners do.  Two thumbs up for this product! "

I hated going to bed with a tampon, risking getting Toxic Shock syndrome, but it was the only thing that somewhat worked.There is nothing bad to say about this product! I don\'d mind the bulkiness of it, nor do I mind the length of it.Side Bar: But one thing I do have to note is that my menstrual started getting lighter since being diagnosed with anemia and taking iron pills daily. A heavy period is not normal, so for those experiencing a heavy cycle, check with your doc.A lot of my symptoms (extreme cramping, heavy clotting, heavy flow, etc), besides PMS, have subsided since taking iron pills, working out and eating more healthy foods. I keep these pads on deck and only use these pads maybe once during my cycle on my most heavy day, which isn\'t nearly as heavy as it once was. So they have lasted me for quite a while.Sorry for the side bar, but I had to add that in there in case some of you have been wondering why you are having such heavy cycles.At any rate, this product works!

There are two things that I have always loved about it.  First, it gives an incredibly close shave.  Other razors cut reasonably close, the using the Fusion there are times when I can run my hand across my face and not detect even the tiniest bit of beard.  Nothing but smoothness.  The other thing that I love about the razor is that I have cut myself using it less than any brand of razor than I have ever used.  One might think that five blades might actually increase the chances of getting cut, but this isn\'t the case.There have been several minor design changes over the past few years.  They have all, however, been rather minor.  Until now, that is.  The new Proglide version of the Fusion is considerably different than the other versions.  The main improvement is that blade now tilts back much more sharply, allowing you to shave at many more angles.  I find that this allows a much better shave than before, especially around the nose.  It is just easier to use than before.  The other major change is that there is a heavier lubricant strip.  Frankly, I\'m not a big believer in lubricant strips.  They don\'t seem to me to aid much in shaving.  But if you think this matters, it is definitely true that the lubricant strip is heavier than on the old blades.So, if you haven\'t used the Fusion series, I definitely recommend doing so.  It is a great razor.  And if you have been using the Fusion, I would definitely recommend the upgrade to the new Fusion Proglide.  It is a great improvement to an already great razor.    "

But by keeping the brush on its stand with the charging cord plugged in I should have maximum power for each brushing.  The instructions that come with the brush say you can leave it plugged in, but recommend that every 6 months you let the battery deplete itself.Like another reviewer, I have sensitive teeth and prefer a soft brush.  The brush head that came with the brush seemed to work just fine for me.  The test will be when I have my next visit to the dentist and learn whether there has been an increase in gum erosion since the last visit.  However, just based on short time use, I have no reason to think there will be a problem.  My brushing includes running the brush over my tongue and the bristles feel no different than my other brushThe brush heads that I used on the previous brush don\'t work on this, but the literature that comes with the brush describes 5 different heads that do.  Quite an interesting variety, including floss action, precision clean, white+clean, and sensitive clean.As is true of most electric toothbrushes, heads are pricey if purchased from a local stored.  Amazon sells them at a heavily discounted price, so it is a good place to buy head replacements.  What I do and recommend that others do is to buy a supply of brushes at a time in order to get the best price and insure you have enough on hand to replace a head every 3 months if used twice a day.  The per head price is cheaper if you buy a pack of 6 heads than if you buy the standard 3 pack.  Amazon has both."

When I first opened it, I was confused. I\'d never seen anything like it. It was so strangely light and yet didn\'t seem like it should be. The material made me think of memory foam, only super soft textured.With how thin it was at the top, I didn\'t think it would be impressive for my flow (I have endometriosis, so that means I always have to wear overnight or better, maximum protection pads to keep up with my super flow, sometimes in addition to a tampon, which I hate wearing). Well, it worked great and it really felt like I didn\'t have anything on.I decided to actually buy the product this period to see if it was just a fluke and put it to the test immediately with my worst time--overnight on my heaviest night. When even the best pads have failed me in the past.Not a drop off the pad. The wings held and only in one place did it even leave the center of the top (the entire bottom was filled). And I felt DRY. If I hadn\'t seen the bottom, I\'d have thought maybe there was no flow overnight.I tried another today and got that familiar \'overproducing\' feeling that always leads to pad failure. I went to the bathroom, expecting a mess and the pad had contained it completely. It hadn\'t approached any edges. I was shocked and amazed. I\'ve never had a pad work this well, in 15 years of super-heavy periods, that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage.What\'s more, I almost always get irritation on this day in my cycle. Nada. I am SOLD.So, to recap: it held more than any other pad I\'ve seen that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage. It left NO irritation on a heavy day. It worked overnight on my worst night. And I feel dry--it absorbs faster than anything I\'ve ever worn. I\'ve never felt compelled to review a product as strongly as this before, lol. Probably hormones ;)"

We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs. I love it!    "

I love that they fit on any Venus razor; although, they best match the Divine handle because of the blue text on the blade. They\'re rounded so there\'s no sharp edges. However, they can sometimes be bulky when it comes to feminine curves. Because there are no wires over the blades, the Venus Divine razor is quite easy to rinse off. It doesn\'t have as many nooks and crannies which attract hair, soap or cream like the Quattro blades.Overall, I love the Divine razors. I always get a great shave on my legs and underarms. Those areas don\'t require any shaving cream with Divine\'s multiple moisture strips. I rarely cut myself and irritation around the bikini line and intimate areas is minimal when used with a good shaving cream. The comfort coated blades glide quite smoothly over the skin without catching or scraping, with help from the smoothing cushions. I believe both of those features are only on the Divine razor blades, not the regular Venus blades.The moisture strips add moisture you can touch to the blades (much more-so than the original Venus blades); although, it can feel a bit slimy if you leave it in the shower (the slimyness and moisture both fade over time). The moisture strips are supposed to fade when it\'s time to refill but I\'ve honestly never noticed it so I just replace when I feel like I am not getting an awesome shave anymore.    "

It dries pretty quickly so I didn\'t notice it for long. After removing the lid, the deodorant comes up through these 50 holes in the sub-lid. It\'s wide enough for a huge underarm so a lot was wasted as the product cannot be rolled back down. It does work, I loved the way it didn\'t let me get wet at all.  But, I think I know the reason for that. I don\'t know what the deodorant has in it but after about the third day I had it on, I noticed that at the end of the day my underarms were sticky....hard sticky. That night in the shower I couldn\'t get it off.  The only thing I can akin it to is the feeling that 80\'s fry-baby might have now. The sticky that comes from not removing all of the grease from the outside of the baby.  Just sticky.  I quit using it then.  Even after repeated washings with my hand and a washrag, it took me another two days to get it from under my arm.  I gave it to my husband to use and he hasn\'t complained. Of course, he does have hair and tends to use a liquid deodorant anyway.Another thing that bothered me was that upon looking underneath the sub-lid, the product was almost gone.

First, when using on your legs, I have to admit it\'s really great. I found the shave to be close and my legs were amazingly smooth after using it (almost as if I had used some kind of baby lotion or shaving cream on my legs).

The head is large and contoured, ideal for mowing down wide swaths of follicular profusion. The shower caddy is a neat idea. It is backed by two suction cups for gripping the shower stall (tip: works better when wet) that conceals a small, swing-out storage space for extra blades. The swing gets loose easily, so careful!

They\'re not perfect, but they\'re the best that I\'ve found.  When I saw this new Venus Pro Skin, I decided to give it a try because it\'s actually cheaper than buying a new pack of blades (less blades, so more per blade, but cheaper overall) and you get a new handle with it, which is always nice because the handles can get dirty over time.The box opened astonishingly easy.  No scissors required.  This handle is a little bit longer and has more of an angle to it than other handles in the Venus series.  I thought that was nice.  The see-through light blue color was very pretty too.  Compared to my old Venus, this razor looked sleek and shiny.  I become more skeptical when I examined the new razor heads, though. The razor is surrounded by two gel pads.  There\'s nothing backing them, no plastic holding them on.  They move easily up and down as you touch them.  I\'ve had experience with some of these in-head shaving gel products before and have found that they usually completely fall apart or all of the lotion/gel is gone in about two shaves, when of course the razors should last much longer than that.Using the razor I found that it felt very nice on my skin.  I could tell the gel was helping lubricate the skin, but it wasn\'t overly sudsy.  However large strings of gel kept coming off the razor.  This was a little bit gross.  Also the head was too large to fit into tight curves and made it really hard to shave certain spots.  As I expected, one shave used about half of the gel pad, which is a big disappointment.The big test for me is after I get out of the shower, though.  For the first time in ages I didn\'t have any nicks from shaving with a new blade!  I always dread switching blades because I always get cut up.  Also my legs didn\'t itch.  I frequently have trouble with razor burn and itching, and this product actually solved that for me when nothing else has.So where does that leave me?  This product worked wonders for protecting my skin when nothing else has.  I love it for that reason alone.  But the gel pad isn\'t going to last more than a few shaves, which would mean that I\'d have to buy a new head every few days.  That would be ridiculously expensive, but honestly maybe worth it considering how much I do suffer from razor burn normally.  I think if you have problems with razor burn, you should give this product a try.  If you\'re looking for a new handle for the Venus, this one is very pretty.  But if you\'re happy with your current shaving gel routine, these gel pads are bulky and won\'t last hardly any time at all.  For those people, I think this product is a waste of money.    "

I visited my friend couple of days ago and I had to borrow his razor, which was the Fusion.  The problem with this blade (and also the Quattro, and also to some degree the 3 bladed razors) is that because the blades are so close together, the cut hair gets stuck between the blades more easilly.  This requires more time rinsing between strokes, so it overall doesn\'t save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive, so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it\'s important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades (compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel) helps in shaving large parts of skin, like legs or whatever.  But when it\'s your face with its nooks and crannys, I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort. The 6th blade feature was OK, but didn\'t feel like it was worth it.Remember, that with any NEW blade, you will get an awesome shave.  People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it, because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they\'re reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit----Recently got this as a gift.

The scent is not overpowering in any way, and it makes hair so soft you can brush right through it while soaking wet.This 33.80 oz bottle is HUGE.

After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up. Unfortunately i cannot tell you if they will last a long time since i just got mine about a week ago but i can tell you the difference between the two brands.The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you\'re not trying to, just when you\'re normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you\'re doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B\'s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i\'m brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B\'s. It\'s a bit annoying.The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy ine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They\'re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, but i\'ve yet to see how often they break. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They\'re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you\'re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain."

It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.    "

These bars basically provide the glide that you usually get from shave gel or foam.  You can definitely shave without lathering up.  That saves you time and cost.  However, the bars do mean that you have to press a little harder than you might be used to when the razor head is new to get a close shave.  (As the bars wear down from use, you don\'t have to press as hard.)  Until you get used to this, you may notice some unintended stubble.  Also, the bars make it a little tough to clean the razor.  I\'ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I\'m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  It\'d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  I really liked the scent on this one, and I\'m not normally a fan of shave gel scents.The second big feature of the Venus line is the easy-to-change razor head.  When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  Then, you open a sealed replacement head and click the handle into the slot.  It\'s a much safer and easier replacement process than razors I\'ve owned in the past.  Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it\'s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  Each razor head is individually packaged, so it\'s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  You don\'t have to worry about cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.The third feature is the hanging rack.  The Venus razor kit comes with a mounting rack for your shower.  The rack sticks to the shower wall using adhesive pads, and it holds 4 replacement blades (not included) and the razor with a blade attached.  I\'ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  Gillette didn\'t improve on this design for the Spa Breeze line.  I was hoping they\'d offer a suction-cup design.  Also, the design is such that you can\'t really use it unless you wall mount it.  The razor needs gravity to stay in place, and because the bottom of the rack is rounded, you can\'t just set it vertically on a shelf.  I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.As for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  I have very fine hair.  Many razors just aren\'t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I\'ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)All in all, the Venus line is excellent.  I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  I\'d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.    "

I was happy with it but when I went to go pick up blades last time, I thought I would give this one a try. While this is a good blade and a very smooth system, I don\'t really notice much (if any) of an improvement over the Fusion system.

When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it\'s hard to continue shaving when there\'s hair worsening the blades\' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick. Whatever the case, I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades.    "

And the detail trimmer on the back of the head is dull and useless right out of the packaging.The single improvement this razor has over the last generation is that the handle of the blade is more comfortable in the hand and balanced better. The downstroke is useless, the upstroke is the shave. The total shave is overall the same except that I can\'t use the downstroke at all anymore. And at the jacked up price they\'re pumping out these beauties at, it\'s not worth anything at all. I\'ll stick with my M3 Power. Sorry Gillette. Your new thing just ain\'t the best a man can get.

But for most guys, it simply doesn\'t deliver the closeness the \'old-fashioned\' 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:1) They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  But in the current Proglide commercial, the cartoon is altered to show the second blade doing nothing except scraping the skin, with the hair ending up sticking out above the skin surface.  Major BS here by Gillette.2) If you\'re not comatose, you\'ll notice on their \'Take the Proglide Challenge\' commercials (the one with the used-car salesman guy), they are actually comparing Proglide vs. a DISPOSABLE RAZOR!!!  What does that prove?  How low can Gillette go???Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn\'t totally worthless.  They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  Bottom line is, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  After 2 shaves, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that\'s less close AND less smooth.    "

But after switching from my regular (cheaper) shampoo to this, I thought I had started to develop dandruff--which is not something I ever have. Every morning during my morning styling, my shoulders would be covered with flakes by the time that I was done.  So there must be something in the shampoo that is intended to add body to the hair shaft, but it doesn\'t seem to want to stick there.  Just to double-check, I went back to my old shampoo and the \'dandruff\' suddenly went away.  I never got a sense of fuller body, either.

5835,2662,2728,20100915,B003UKKHB4,3,"September 15, 2010",AHFGCH8LANEZK,Oral-b vs. Sonicare,"I am a nut when it comes to dental care.  I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  I floss daily and have used a Sonicare electric brush for close to 15 years.  It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  That was a bit much for me.  And my teeth weren\'t that bad, it\'s just that he was very fastidious.  I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  And I ALWAYS swish my mouth out with water after eating or drinking anything.Anyway, when I got the chance to try this Oral-b, of course I was up for the challenge.  When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the other.After trying the Oral-b for a week, I can tell you that I am definitely a Sonicare person.  Here is the breakdown of my experience:Oral-b pros:*Handle feels nice in hand.  It has a silicone/rubbery grip that is ergononimic*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.Oral-b cons:*Way too noisy.  I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  Not a relaxing experience, I felt too stressed with all of the noise, lights, and buzzing.*The depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush head.*It does not stop after 2 minutes of brushing.  I am used to the way the Sonicare handle stops working after you\'ve hit the 2 minute mark.  With the Sonicare if I want to keep brushing after the 2 minutes, I just press the button again.  With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn\'t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  Next bullet point.*Loud humming with surge pulse.  This is Oral-b\'s answer to Sonicare\'s quadrant pacer, where it nudges you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn\'t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!*Single button control. It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.*Cleanliness?  I didn\'t feel like my teeth were any cleaner than they already were when I used my Sonicare.I still believe that liking the Oral-b or Sonicare is a matter of personal preference.  Cost analysis-wise, the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  But I prefer the Sonicare."

The fakes are also getting very hard to spot, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page for the \'floss action\' had were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference is in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. I personally wouldn\'t buy from Amazon because it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off may be similar in quality.I bought several different brush heads from Amazon this Christmas, and all appear to be fakes. In the case of this particular product, I also noticed that the bristles were not very strong since a few broke in half the very first time I used it."

I was skeptical that the moisturizing strip would last long enough.  It could have lasted a little longer, but I\'m still happy.  I would say it lasted about a month, and in that time, I was shocked at what a time saver it is not to have to apply shaving cream!  It did take some getting used to in the beginning figuring out the angle to get the best cut with the upper and lower moisturizing bars sticking out further than the blade, but now it\'s a \'breeze\'.  It\'s also nice that you don\'t have to worry about applying shaving cream to hard to reach places or that it will wash off - it\'s always on your razor!  As a busy mom with a one and three year old, I\'m not shaving every day, but I definitely found myself shaving more often because it took less time.  Now that the moisturizing bar has worn off, the razor is still sharp and I can still use it with shaving cream.  I didn\'t have any issues with cuts or razor burn and am putting the cartridges on my Wish List for Christmas.    "

The brushes however, while harder than I am used to are color coded so that the head can be switched for multiple people to use.

So, after a few days of brushing, I went to the directions to see why my new toothbrush kept pausing or hesitating after a couple minutes of brushing.  Low and behold, it\'s a feature designed to let you know it\'s time to move on to another part of your mouth...very nice.The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.  The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  I have found the button placement may not be located at the best spot for some people.  While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  The brush is thinner than other brushes I have used.  I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  Also, the brush head is much smaller with fewer frills than other sonic brushes I have tried.Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.

Recently I asked my girlfriend to pick up some razors at the store \'not cheap ones please\' and boy was that a mistake. Anyway, I happened to be on Amazon already buying something so I looked at razors and decided on this one. I actually didn\'t know that it was a battery operated razor. I had used a Gillette razor before and it gave me a good shave. So when I got this one with the battery and stuff I was kinda skeptical but figured it would shave good without the vibrations so I didn\'t have to turn it on to shave if I didn\'t want to... I thought maybe it would just carve up my face like a Halloween pumpkin. The first time I used it I was very pleasantly surprised. I figured maybe it was just because it was a brand new blade, which always shave great the first time. I am here writing this review now because after a week and a half of using this thing with the same blade, it\'s still shaving closer than any shave I\'ve ever had before. Really. I have had close shaves before but could still feel where the hair would eventually come back again meaning it was close but like it was only cutting the hair even with the skin and this one seems to cut it even lower if that makes sense. I can\'t believe how smooth my face is. Truly smooth as a baby\'s butt. I have to actually take my time and pay attention now more than before, because if I miss a spot, I can really feel the difference. My girlfriend has really noticed the difference too... (don\'t tell her I said this but it\'s almost annoying how much she is touching and kissing my face now. lol)I didn\'t get any replacement blades with my original order, but I\'ve been looking at the local stores and all the prices have been twice what I see here on Amazon for replacement blades. The actual razor is about the same, but I laughed when I saw 4 replacement blades at Rite Aid for the same price I just bought 8 here on Amazon. I think I\'ll buy some more replacements to have on hand when I go traveling next month.I have no idea what the last reviewer is complaining about. This thing is great... and the extra blade for trimming sideburns is great, even helps me to get under my nose perfectly. I feel no danger of being cut. I really believe this is the most complete and closest shave I have ever had. Very satisfied. I will never use a disposable razor or an electric razor again.    "

But even under the best of circumstances, the volume just does not last. This shampoo claims to be formulated to give fine hair that much needed boost, which, when used with other products in the line, will last all day.As a shampoo it is just fine.  It lathers nicely and has a pleasant light fragrance. (The hair gods have truly cursed me..in addition to stubborn, wavy fine hair, my hair only holds obnoxious odors like cigarette smoke and the awful fried smell from grills.  So fragrance usually is not an issue for me.)  The shampoo did remove the product I had used previously and left my hair soft, shiny with nice body.  I did not notice any significant difference from this shampoo as opposed to any other.  Obviously, super clean hair has more volume and bounce than hair not in its first freshness.  I did also try it with a sample size of the conditioner and root lift and must say that the volume held, but again not significantly more so than when I use other light conditioners and root lift.  So while I probably am condemned to continue with a good cut and styling aids, this is a satisfactory product in all respects.  It is relatively inexpensive and delivers good results,.  So while the Breck girl has nothing to fear from,me, I will continue to use this shampoo as well as the root lift and conditioner. "

Well, my brushing habits and checkups slipped over the years and that left me with alot of bad teeth and plaque buildup.I now get regular dental care and try my best to keep my teeth looking their best. that\'s where this product comes into play.the design is wonderful. simply place toothpaste on the replaceable head and brush all your teeth including your gumline. you will get the feeling that you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. this gets deep into every nook and cranny of your mouth. it really works and stregthens your gums, and if you floss regularly your gums will no longer bleed when brushing.battery life is mediocre, sometimes lasting a a month or longer depending on frequency of use. i use mine roughly 3 times a day and i get about 5 weeks out of  a standard raovac AA battery. which to me, is acceptable.don\'t not press down to hard when brushing, this will cause the head to wear out faster than need be, and it will fray very easily if you use alot of pressure. just go ahead put some toothpaste on the head and play your favorite 3 minute song, and you will be on your way to better oral health. the benefits from switching from manual toothbrushes to this one have been enormous! my dentist actually commented on how clean my teeth were.this is a cheaper alternative to paying 60, 70, or 80 bucks for the higher end models. replacement heads are a little more expensive than normal manual toothbrushes but having cleaner teeth was a sacrifice i was willing to make.an overall great product. good alternative to more expensive brands. way to go oral b!"

Yeah, I remember. What a sensation! What a shave! What a waste of money. The expensive Mach 3 line has practically surpassed every razor out there in quality shaving and design. But it will never surpass the meaning of the word \'deal\'. And now, just a couple of years back, we were introduced to the Mach 3 TURBO, the special edition of a Mach 3 razor. Hmmm, silver all the way through. Shiny! Very dashing. Wow.....shaves well too, now that the three blades are coated to reduce friction. That\'s a relief! The razor has an evil price tag of about $11 canadian, and the razor cartridges go for about $10 for 4, or $19 for 8. I guess the Gillette head honchos needed a new fleet of \'Porsche Boxter\' convertibles and a few yachts. Well, if they get us to spend the money on their stuff, then we\'ll make them look richer than real estate dumbbell Tom Vu and Sly Stallone put together. I love a good, comfortable, gash free shave. And the Mach 3 is a terrific razor to get this wonderful shave I look forward to every morning. Mind you, the Mach 3 Turbo is just....well, too good of a razor. Kind of like an oversensitive Ferrari sport steering system. It\'ll get to every corner and turn...with scary precision. So, anti-friction coating or not, it\'s a serious blade. Yesterday, I went and bought the less expensive Schick Extreme 3, and even with it\'s three blades, it gives me a shave nearly as close as the Mach 3. Okay, so that\'s an A- shave, and not an A+. Still, the \'Extreme\' is a terrific razor, cuts the hairs well without leaving me the feeling that I have to be \'so\' careful with it, and is a much more reasonable price for both the razor and blade cartridges than the mighty Mach 3. Sigh. What\'s this world coming to? All this wasted money spent to find a razor that\'s a good price and gives you a great shave. Yeah....guess you could say that recently, I went to extremes.

However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion Power blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.    "

The aloe strips around both sides of the blades make for a very well lubricated shave, too.  Some may perhaps find it to be too much, but it works well.  So, the razor set up works well.  My wife\'s legs turned out great with it, and I even gave it a go on my face.  Both proved successful.But the holder to go in the shower, which would be a great thing if it worked, just falls off the wall, no matter how we tried it.  So, I wouldn\'t put much hope into the holder working.The starter set here comes with an extra blade, and the holder at least works to store back-ups.So, a good razor pick-up, but an apparently unreliable shower dispenser.

This razor feels so light weight and truly glides upon the skin.  This newest model feels like a light feather traveling over your skin.  This very gentle gliding across the skin allowed for faster, smoother strokes, like there was no resistance.  The results are equally spectacular:  very smooth feel and NO cuts.

You don\'t need a set of safe cracking tools to open the plastic wrapping - there\'s a perforation for easy opening!  At last!Next you\'ll notice the storage pod that holds the razor and two spare cartridges.  The pod attaches to the wall with a couple of suction cups.  (Much nicer than the adhesive strips some manufacturers want you to use to attach their products to your walls!)  The pod is cute, but I don\'t stick things to the walls - so my pod and extra cartridges are going into a drawer.The main event is the razor itself.  The gel handle is very comfortable and the razor feels well balanced in the hand.  The head is wider than usual - a good feature when shaving the legs, may be kind of dicey on the underarms.  Another nice feature is the moisture strip which increases the glide factor on the skin, although it doesn\'t entirely eliminate the need for shaving gel or foam.The razor head shaves close and doesn\'t nick - at least the first time you use it.  The actual blades are on the thin / flimsy side, so you\'ll be changing the cartridge with above average frequency.  I don\'t know that a five blade head shaves any better / closer / faster than three blades, or two, or even one - but a five blade head does seem to clog up up more and faster than the others.  You\'ll be interrupting your shave quite a bit for rinsing and tapping.In summary, there are lots of cute features - the pod, the gel handle, the extra wide head and moisture strip.  The five blade head looks impressive, but the blades are flimsy and clog up five times as fast as a single blade.  Three and a half stars.    "

Nice Shaver!,"If you suffer from folliculitis, this may just be the razor you were waiting for! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.Also, I bought the Power model but am not sure yet which mode I like best: power or manual. But since you can choose whether or not to turn the power on or not, buying the power model seems best to me. You can get the best of both worlds!In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.    "

On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &quot;indicator strip&quot; sooner.I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem.

I first bought this a while back ago but didn\'t want to write a review until I fully tested it out for a several months. I bought mine from Oral Care Deals so this review is from their product, and I was very pleased by them. One thing that I absolutely LOVED about this toothbrush was its ability to change the brush tip, which also comes with colored rings that you can identify which person it belongs too. I initially was looking for an electric toothbrush for me and my husband but when i came across this one i found out that we can both use it and all we have to do is to change the brush tip. It comes with a brush tip holder that you can place 4 tips one, so basically 4 people can use this one brush, now thats awesome by itself! We found that the battery is long lasting so you don\'t need to charge it after a few brushes. the grip is comfortable and its easy on the wrist! every time I brush I get the same feeling as i do when i go to my dentist for my six month cleaning. My dentist even said this is the best one on the market right now. Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well. bottom line don\'t hesitate to buy this model (dental professional exclusive 5000 series) because it an investment that will pay off."

While the packaging looks OEM, the quality of these heads is vastly inferior to ones purchased off the shelf at Target/CVS/etc.  The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  I\'ve used Oral-B electric brushes for over 10 years, and these heads behaved very differently.  After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!) during operation.  Also, I noticed that the \'blue indicator bristles\' never changed color at all after 8-12 weeks of use.  I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  I have noted other reviews echo these same problems.My opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...I am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product."

While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I\'m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn\'t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don\'t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I\'d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I\'ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I\'m not a dental health professional, so I don\'t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn\'t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it\'s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can\'t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I\'m afraid I don\'t care for it enough to do even that).If you\'re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I\'ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn\'t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums."

I found this to be a huge plus, especially when worn overnight.  No chafing or irritation, even when worn while working out for about an hour.- Reliability: No leaks or staining even with heavy flow.  The channels on the pad help to lock in flow plus I found the pad stays in place very well, especially for a pad without wings.- Thickness: Here\'s where these pads lose some points.  A fellow reviewer compared these to a baby\'s diaper - I agree these are quite thick but willing to accept that for the positive factors above.  For overnight use the thickness of this pad isn\'t too big of a deal, but I wouldn\'t recommend wearing this pad under very tight fitting clothing (then again, maybe tight fitting clothes aren\'t such a good idea for the days you need a super maxi!)"

Although I\'m a loyal Always user, I had never tried their Infinity line of pads - honestly, I didn\'t know if they were that much better than their regular line to spend the extra bucks.Right away, I was shocked when opening the wrapper to see that the pad appears full of holes (over-my-head engineering towards absorbency, I suppose -- or perhaps aerodynamics? Ha!). Anyway, there IS a liner underneath, but it still looks a bit frightening. I bravely wore one, and yes, the absorbency and dryness was slightly better than the current Always products I use. The holes did their job.However, my favorite part of the Infinity pad is the wing design! I never would have thought much about it (wings are wings, I thought), but the Infinity pad has a scalloped \'B\' edge to its wing. I had more successful \'sticking\' of the Infinity\'s wing than I\'ve ever had with a normal curved \'D\' edged wing. Usually the wings (though very important and necessary to me in a pad), cause the most stress and hassle when applying! Part of it sticks, part of it doesn\'t and curls upward, leaving sticky spots exposed. Not comfortable. So, the \'B\' shaped edge of the Infinity pad was a plus!Overall, I would definitely use the Infinity pads again, but probably only if I had a coupon to defray the extra cost. Either way, I trust Always\' products for confident protection!"

Since they were on a 50% rebate sale, i just bought the top of the line 5000 unit.  I could not be more pleased with how clean my teeth end up - I have never had a brush that cleans as well as this one; my hygienist will be so pleased!I would like to expound on the advantages of this unit over the 4000 or 3000 in cleaning ability, but I have no idea, not having used the others.  If the only difference is gimmicks, then this unit is certainly full of them, and you might be just as pleased with a cheaper unit without the unnecessary gimmicks and modes.One big con: there is a mode button to toggle through the 5 different modes that are built into this unit.  Most people, like me, will probably only use one mode, or at least will predominately use one mode.  The mode button is VERY poorly placed, in a very key position.  It is impossible to use this unit without accidentally hitting the mode key on a regular basis, if not every day.  Very annoying to have to figure out how to get back to your preferred mode.  They could not have chosen a poorer location for this if that was the goal.  Its like accidentally hitting the caps lock key on a laptop, for those who do not look at the screen while we type. What were they thinking, if they were thinking at all?  I like good design.  All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an \'F\' for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO. It was just too big a mistake to be an oversight. A smaller con - the outlet plug is a huge unit that sticks straight out from the wall - takes up space and looks stupid - should have been flush.Yet overall, I gave this 4 stars for the great cleaning and the rest of the design and charger."

The toothbrush came with 2 heads, and it took a while to charge (I didn\'t see the battery light at first so I was worried).

I always got razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and my facial hair isn\'t even curly. I have tried everything from electric razors, to clippers, to double edge safety razors, and even changing the directions that I shaved. Nothing has ever really worked.  I received a free fusion in the mail, and was skeptical. I tried it, but I still got razor bumps. But then I thought for a second about shaving WITH the grain and NOT stretching the skin, and thought even more about using a shaving brush that I had purchased. I also decided to use a simple, cheap shaving cream, Barbasol Aloe Shaving Cream that I already had in my closet. I found the SOLUTION!  But I should also mention that I shave in the shower with a mirror. I now look forward to shaving, and I feel that shaving everyday is best because it allows your face to grow accustomed to shaving, also allowing the hairs on your face to grow in the direction that you shave, remember-WITH the grain. If you shave with the grain you greatly reduce your chances of having ingrown hairs. If you want to love shaving, and be like that guy who has a perfect shave, get yourself a gilette fusion, a shaving brush, a shower mirror, and a mug. Shave in the shower:Let your face get wet with hot water for at least 2 mins, put some shaving cream on a brush and stretch your skin out (only while brushing)  and brush your beard for 2 mins, fill your mug with hot water and dip your razor in the mug every couple of strokes. Shave in the direction of hair growth, never against and don\'t stretch it, if anything puff up your face! I make two passes, after the first one I re-lather and fill my mug up again with more hot water. And you don\'t need to leave the water on!!! That\'s what the mug is for. Try this for a few days and tell me, someone who has suffered for 7 years, that it isn\'t the best shave you ever had.    "

Gillette claims each disposable blade will last up to a month, but I have found Gillette blades (the three blade version) to last three weeks. So I expect this five blade version to last well past a month. That\'s amazing.The Gillette Fusion handle costs $3 more and the refills (8) cost $10 more, but they last longer and the shave is so much closer. Spend the few extra dollars and get a razor with blades that last longer than any other on the market. I suggest buying in bulk to save money. You do get what you pay for.    "

For someone who dreads shaving because every excursion results in a bloody nick, this razor changed my view entirely.The handle attaches to the head at the bottom, leaving the head to swivel naturally with each body curve.  Most razors have the handle attaching at the top of the razor so mobility is limited.For the first time since I started shaving my legs, I did not come away with nicks, cuts, or scrapes.  The multiple blade head seems to float over the turns and curves of the body and gives a close shave with little pressure.I also liked the enclosed shower pod which holds the additional blades and keeps them dry yet handy.  Nothing worse than having to leave the shower to get a new razor.  The pod has stuck in its original place so I haven\'t had problems with it falling off the tile as have other reviewers.Overall, there isn\'t anything I can say that I didn\'t like.  So, for women who have tried waxing, lotions, or other razors, give this a try.  I don\'t think you\'ll be disappointed.  No fuss, straight forward and no PAIN!    "

One of the reasons is that it\'s strong enough to really clean your hair but not so harsh that it dries your scalp.  In the past I\'ve had highlights and I\'ve used this shampoo without any detrimental effects.  Granted, if I colored my hair again I would use a shampoo made especially for treated hair (probably Pantene, since I\'m a creature of habit).As far as conditioning I have to say that it is very light.  For my daughter, for example, who has fine, straight, but remarkably easy-to-tangle hair, we still have to use a detangler.  So it\'s a lighter conditioning effect than if you used a separate conditioner.  Personally I like this because it doesn\'t \'weigh\' down my hair, just controls the humidity frizzes.OVERALL, a gentle, thorough cleanser with gentle conditioning that makes combing after shampooing easier.Pam T~mom-blogger "

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.    "

Just a week ago (Feb 16, 2012) the battery had gone dead on it. I was pretty happy considering it lasted over 6 years. Granted it was a little more expensive than the 5000, I still expect this SmartSeries to perform as good if not better. When reading the manual on this toothbrush I seen the section on the battery in it. It gave instructions on what to do if and when the battery goes dead on it. I tried to perform the procedure on my old Sonicare since they have the same basic structure. I couldn\'t seem to open the bottom of it and any suggestions would be great. However, I don\'t even know if the battery on that model is even replaceable. When I first turned on the SmartSeries 5000 I noticed a BIG difference that my old Sonicare. The sound was extremely different. The Sonicare had a tight buzzing sound that sounded very well built. The 5000 had more of a loose buzz. It is a bit louder and makes me question if its going to last half the time my old toothbrush did. Who knows, maybe this is a new addition that cleans your teeth better or maybe I\'m just so used to my old one that I question anything different. The Smart Guide system on this brush is pretty cool. If you have kids, it will definitely make them want to brush. There\'s a smiley face that gets bigger and bigger the longer your brush. You can stick the Smart Guide screen onto a mirror or the wall. The toothbrush also has a monitor in it that lets you know if you\'re brushing too hard. There is a red light that is very noticeable on the handle that lights up when your pushing too hard. It is compatible with 5 different brush heads that supposedly do different things. I don\'t know if this is just a selling point or what but I find it pretty handy. Overall, there is not much difference in the 1000, 1500, 3000, or 5000. Just a couple additions the higher the number but the basic stuff is going to be there with all of them. If I had to do it over I would have gotten a cheaper one. I thought getting the biggest and best one would have more advantages. It\'s still a good buy and I have no complaints as of yet."

The time it takes me to shave has not been significantly reduced, but it has helped some and I do like the less irritation that it provides.I\'ve found the new razor lasts me 5 to 7 days of shaving before it wears out. However, the blue strip does wear out after about 4 days, but I continue to use it for a few more. I had used the Mach 3 Power razor for several years and the new Fusion Power is the best shave yet. I had similar results with the Mach 3 blades lasting about 5 to 7 shaves.I usually let me face have a rest on the weekend from all the shaving during the week, and I haven\'t stopped that tradition. For the past two weekends I skipped a day and shaved on Sunday or Monday morning.The razor has had no problems shaving through two days of growth. I have thick stubble by day two and the shave is as good as ever. The razor doesn\'t get clogged and can be cleaned out easily.I\'m getting use to the new precision trimmer on the back of the razor to shave under my nose and side-burns.

I still have some of the Mach 3 Power blades I need to use so once those are gone, I\'ll be strictly using the Fusion Power Razor.One other thing to consider is the kind of shaving cream or gel you use. I\'ve noticed that the better, \'more expensive\' ones provide a better feeling during and after a shave. I currently use Gillette\'s Shaving Gel, but I want to try the new Fusion Hydra Gel. I also want to try the King of Shaves gel. I\'ve also found the Neturogena razor defense post shave lotion to be a great product!Ultimately, the razor looks good and feels good in your hand. The shave is great and I\'m hooked!    "

5442,2269,2321,20101124,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 24, 2010",AERARMG71WXQB,Extremely Pleased with my purchase of the Oral-B Pro 5000,"I have owned one other rechargable toothbrush in my life and that was a Water Pic about 25 years ago when I was 35. It was nothing to write home about and was very basic compared to what is available these days. Once the battery went dead, I just went back to a manual toothbrush. I decided after my dentist appointment that my wife and I went to a couple weeks ago and having to pay $70(times 2) out of pocket as my copay for a deep cleaning for each of us to remove build up under the gums that I would see what was available in a rechargeable. It was a toss up as my dentist recommended both Oral-B, but only carried SonicCare with a $15 rebate at the front counter for sale. While at the Dentist office, I did enter a drawing for their top of the line SonicCare FlexCare Plus with Sanitizer by donating some can food for a local food bank for Thanksgiving. I am the type of guy that if I brought 999 cans and had a 999 out a thousand chance would not win in a drawing. I went home....researched both brands....read tons of reviews and checked the pricing on Amazon. The Oral-B reviews were consistly higher and the price with the 50% rebate on this model made it a hands down easier decision. This professional care toothbrush normally $159.99 retail was on Amazon last Wednesday for $104.99. I purchased 2 sets. They arrived at my door yesterday, with the free shipping and no sales tax. I was impressed when I opened them as to all that was included. My mindset was ....wow....only $50 for all this per set after rebate. It comes with at nice durable blue travel case that houses the toothbrush, and 2 brush heads. A nice travel charger that is multi-voltage and will work in other countries such as UK or Australia. It even came with an extra set of duracell batteries for the remote control clock/timer. I thought that was a nice touch that they would include those. The rechargable toothbrushes were both battery dead, so I set one up in each bathroom, and let them charge overnight to full charge. I used mine first thing this morning and was pleasantly surprised as to how easy and proficient it was brushing...I mean.... 30000 brush stokes per minute is 500 per second and I know I was never doing that manually. It comes with two different styled toothbrushes...one round and one flossing type. The flossing type is my favorite as it actually is flossing while brushing, so it is a 2 in 1 brush. Your teeth will feel like you just had them professionally cleaned at the dentist office. That nice squeaky sound when you touch your teeth with your finger. The toothbrush has like 5 settings for brushing from Sensitive to Deep Clean. The default setting worked perfectly for my teeth and gums. The little handy remote control timer......sits to the side and not only gives you the time of day, but when you turn on the toothbrush it automatically starts a 2 minute timer or 3 minute depending on how you set it up and times you on a 2 minute timer to 30 seconds per quadrant and lets you know when to move to the next set of teeth in the next quadrant and gives you a smiley face when you are done.  Funny, as I was typing this review I got a phone call from my dentist telling me that I won the raffle for the $189.99 Sonic FlexCare+ with sanitizer and that I could come pick it up. While I have never won anything before I am more hyped up on the Oral B and will likely just sell the SonicCare FlexCare+ on Craigslist for more than I paid for both of my Oral B\'s together. I apologize if this was too wordy. I am not a professional writer and I base what I buy off of what others write and just did not want to miss anything."

The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare\'s."

I had a 2-3 day stubble- always problematic, especially above the chin and the upper lip- and it cut through that like butter.  Contrary to what a few of the other reviewers said, I feel that the vibration materially improves the feel of the shave- I turned it off and felt quite a difference.  Sure, the blades are a little more expensive, but what\'s it worth to make a chore that men do daily (well, at least most men do most days) this much more pleasant?  Priceless!    "

I\'d had a not-so-good experience with the Quattro, so I was a little wary when I discovered this one had even more blades.My experience with the Fusion: It does grab the stubble and take it off slightly better than the M3 Power, but ONLY shaving counter to the direction of the beard growth.  When I shave, I usually mix my strokes up and down, and found that this razor did not remove the beard as well as the M3 Power when shaving on the downstroke.  So I had to restroke my face on certain areas which remained rough after the initial shave, which actually added to my shaving time.  I can only assume the other reviewers who said shaving time was decreased, use only upstrokes when shaving.Second, I was very disappointed when the blue indicator strip disappeared completely right after the first shave.  Refill blades are more expensive than the M3 Power, which usually last me 2 or 3 shaves at least.The last con I have is that the battery button is a bit too sensitive and placed exactly where I like to hold the razor with a firm grip.  Twice while I was shaving I accidentally switched it off.Conclusion:  I would use the Fusion to shave only for special or formal occasions, because of the cost of replacement blades and the shaving style needed for optimum work outweigh the benefits of the slightly better shave I could get.For regular everyday shaving, I\'m sticking with the M3 Power.

My reference product was Mennen Speed Stick Antiperspirant Icy Blast. In my reviews I always try do some concrete data gathering, so for this test I compared performance under extra warm conditions and extra stress conditions. The extra clothing or heat induced perspiration was controlled 100% effectively by both products. Under stress situation (such as an important presentation), the Gillette Clinical Strength (GCS) did perform marginally better. I would estimate that a 2 by 2 inch \'wet spot\' with Mennen Speed Stick (MSS) was reduced to about a 1.5 by 1.5 inch spot with GCS, for a 40% better wetness control. Sorry for the graphical details.So I perspire more under stress than under heat. The instructions for GCS are elaborate, three clicks of the screw applied the night before, metered through a bunch of small holes (typical of gel antiperspirants). The fragrance is subtle and baby powder like. Interestingly enough on the ingredients list its referred to as a \'masking fragrance\'.Now for the analysis. The active ingredient in both products is Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex in MSS (or trichlorohydrex in GCS). They are both in the same antiperspirant family as far as any wikipedia or dermatology website explain. The MSS contains 15% active ingredient, while the GCS contains 20% active ingredient. So in summary one additional swipe with the non clinical product gives you as much protection as a \'clinical strength\' product. The clinical product contains 1.7 oz vs 2.7 oz (40% less) for regular and costs over twice as much. For basically same product??? So do the math, and apply one more swipe of your regular product. You will get the same protection at lower cost. Its not that the Gillette Clinical Strength is bad, but it pricing takes advantage of peoples self consciousness about sweating. It should only be 33% more expensive based on the concentration for equivalent weight.    "

I just started using it and it definitely has some extra power that my old one didn\'t have.  It is a bit loud, so if you have sensitive ears, be warned of that.  It charged fast and is holding its battery power well (I don\'t charge it every time I use it).  I brush for 3 minutes and use the 30 second timers for back, top/bottom, right/left, then the extra minute for my front top and bottom... I thought I would hate the 30 second timer and find it annoying, but turns out its really handy to brush each of the areas long enough.  I haven\'t used the little clock thing as I tend to walk around as I brush, but I imagine it would be good for those adjusting to electric toothbrushes and/or kids.  I also probably won\'t use the extra brush holder as my medicine cabinet doesn\'t have the room.  The travel case will definitely come in handy and the small charger is a nice change from my old clunky one.Pros:*Great clean*30 second pauses and 2 minute longer pause*Small charger*Travel case*Should help your dentist visits!!*Pressure notification (if you are brushing too hard, it gives some warning, but I haven\'t experienced it)*Separate timer would be good for kids or those new to electronic brushesCons:*Louder than my old model*Extra stuff... not sure many people need the brush holder, only some will use the separate timer*New heads are expensive"

And it\'s really not too bad for $30.First, you have to realize that if you\'re moving from a normal brush you have to re-learn how to brush. No more moving the brush rapidly with your hand - press the button on the handle and it starts whirling at high speed. Press the brush to your teeth and gums and sloooowly move it left to right or right to left. Make sure you get all three sides of top and bottom, and that you get the gumlines - that\'s the most important part. Obviously it doesn\'t really matter what order you do it in, but if I don\'t keep a pattern I get distracted by pets or people and forget. After two minutes the brush will briefly stop the motor a few times to let you know you\'ve brushed enough - next time you can adjust your movement speed to hit that mark.It includes an induction charger - just set the handle on it. You can do it every night or once a week.So how does this $30 model compare to the $90-120 models? Well, the grip is noticably cheaper, with no rubber grip stripes. The induction charger is very easy to tip over compared to the sturdier \'well\' model. There\'s no charge indicator. The whole thing feels a little bit more flimsy than the 8900, though it never felt like it would actually come apart. There\'s no 30 second indicator like the better models, and there\'s only one speed, though I never found the other speeds on the 8900 useful anyhow.All in all not bad for $30 - of course they\'ll get you for $3-4 each for replacement head, but that\'s only every 3 months or so, and this comes with one head and one spare head. And I think you\'ll do a better job with this than with a regular brush - it\'s very easy to pay for itself if you just get one fewer cavity. If you want one of the above features spring for a better model, but this isn\'t bad for 1/3rd the cost."

After some experimentation I came to the conclusion that something like a sensor two-blade razor was basically as effective as other more expensive options with three or four blades on them. This cost savings is further multiplied by the fact that, in order to fit more blades on those other razors, the blades are made much thinner and are more prone to wearing out. So a sensor blade like these are much cheaper and seem to last longer. This package is a good pack of 20...I\'m not sure if the price is the best one out there, but i was able to throw this in an order and have it delivered rather then making a run to a store and having to remember to get these.

Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife\'s mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a \'clean\' mode and a \'sensitive\' mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars."

The sensation wasn\'t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.  In my experience, though, it doesn\'t.  I don\'t feel I\'m getting a shave that is any better or closer than I get with my regular, non-power Fusion.  And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly.  So, this razor isn\'t really delivering a closer shave, it\'s taking me longer to shave, and I found the vibration to be annoying.  It\'s not something I intend to use.

Years ago my dentist recommended Sonicare and I have been a faithful user of them, upgrading when new models came along.  My dental visits have reflected that use.My hygienist prefers Oral-B and we have talked about it over the years.  I wasn\'t persuaded.  Recently Oral-B started a 50% off campaign and with their 60 day return policy I thought I would try them out.I am glad I did.  I very much like this toothbrush and how it works.  It is bigger than my Sonicare Flex, but even so it feels very good in my hand.  I love the smart timer.  While the Sonicare gives you a beep/jar every 30 seconds, you can see your progress with the Oral-B on the timer.  The Oral-B also gives you a jar too.  In fact, this is the one thing I don\'t like about it.  It is too much of a jar, especially at the 2 minute mark.  It is as if your car is about to stall.After two minutes the Sonicare shuts off.  The Oral-B keeps going until you shut it off.  I am finding that I keep on using it for another 30 to 60 seconds.  Now you can select a deep clean cycle of 3 minutes rather than the normal 2 minute cycle, but I find I prefer going through the normal cycle and then concentrating on the areas my dentist has mentioned as needing extra attention for another 30/60 seconds.The brushes seem to be fine.  I have used the ones that came with the package but also the sensitive head.  I like the sensitive head best.  It is a bit more compact and seems to get the job done.I will know how effective it is for me when I next visit the dentist for a cleaning.But for now, my feeling is that I am doing a better job in brushing and concentrating on the problem areas.I am keeping this and sending in for the rebate."

The first time I have tried it, it felt a bit unpleasant, but I have gotten used to it very quickly. The best thing about this brush is the bigger brush head as compared to Oral-B Triumph. The brush allows you to use twice as much toothpaste (I have always been concerned that I was not using enough toothpaste with round Oral-B brushes), and it seems that it cleans teeth faster on flat surfaces. Getting into corners requires as much effort as with any other toothbrush.What I did not like: the charger is big and you cannot remove extra brush holders; to turn it off you have to push the power button twice (the first time it switches to sensitive mode); you are supposed to use it in a circular motion, and I tend not to be very good at it. In old days I had problems with traditional toothbrushes as I used to move them up and down and ended up scratching my teeth, so I am afraid this might happen with this brush as well. Finally, the description promises whiter teeth in two weeks, but I cannot see any difference."

The Braun manufactured brush comes with the recharger base and 2 floss action brush heads for under $30 from Amazon which strikes me as, perhaps, the best bargain of all available powered brushes on the market because of the high quality and effective design.I\'ve been using the Sonicare system for roughly the last three years and I do love it, but the handle is bulky and the brush heads are expensive to replace.  I always have wondered if there was anything out there that was as good or better?  Enter this system...It actually seems to clean every bit as good, maybe better, and it makes my gums feel much more \'alive\' than the Sonicare does.  Judging by sink remnants it truly does clean at least as well, if not better.  I\'m guessing the floss action heads are truly small engineering marvels as they do seem to actually do what the name implies.  The size of the head suits me well after initially getting use to it.  That, combined with the more svelte handle allows me to easily get to the back of my teeth quite easily, better than the Sonicare IMHO.It is impossible to ignore that this system comes in noticably less in cost than the Sonicare too.  I\'ll still, on occassion, use the Sonicare, but this is my new favorite because it\'s effective cleaning and I really love the better stimulated feeling of my gums.  In fact, I will just say it:  I feel my teeth are cleaner and my gums much more invigorated with this winning product.  For me there are few downsides to this unit that I can think of.

After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.-----THE GIST OF IT---------I\'m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that\'s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn\'t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It\'s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn\'t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn\'t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It\'s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.-----ENDING------Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won\'t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won\'t do it.

I have a heavy beard and sensitive skin, so I am always on the lookout for a better shaver. I have tried several electrics [Norelco & Braun] and of course they are no match for a blade. I have tried the Schick multi blade shavers and the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power with the vibrating handle is better. The blades really do seem to glide over my skin, and if I re-shave against the grain, I get the closest shave I have ever had. This is an improvement over the older Gillette Fusion.  I also recommend using the Gillete Fusion Thermal Face Scrub just prior to shaving. It heats up the skin and seems to thicken and raise the beard hairs so the shave is even closer.    "

I was excited to buy this new line of product, as being certain it would have been better than the previous line Mach 3 Turbo. Result a real disappointment. Here are the reasons from a Gillette fan you can trust:1. 5 razors don\'t work. Over the years for the sake of competition they made double blades, triple blades than it was not enough they released 5-bladed razors like this one. However, since they needed to put the blades closer to each other to fit 5 blades in a limited area of razor head, it simply didn\'t work. Let\'s continue,2. This product has very sharp blades but since 5-very sharp blades are located very close to each other it resulted very bad maneuverability. You simply cut yourself easily if you made a slight side movement while shaving.3. Blades are so sharp it doesn\'t allow you to focus on flat surfaces for a close shave. It just goes through and if you insisted on getting for a closer shave you will cut yourself.4. You might think I have a sensitive skin type, BUT believe me I don\'t. Believe it or not with a Mach 3 I never cut myself never, never. I have very thick and strong hair, I can\'t use a regular razor for shaving. Only and Only Gillette Mach 3 handles my facial hair but not this one.5. This product has engineering flaws which is resulted from competitive 5-blade which are put very closely together and you cannot handle this razor well even if you are a surgeon. I know because I\'m  very successful with using my hands because of my profession. But thanks to engineers who developed this I cut myself with this razor, for the first time.6. It\'s your choice whether or not you buy this product but I want to remind you that for the first time I\'m taking my time and writing a review for a razor, be careful it\'s a razor not a Gillette anymore.A final personal shaving tip: If you want your high quality razor blades last longer than usual, do not rinse them with hot or warm water while shaving. If you use cold water for rinsing blades, you will see them lasting sharp for a longer period of time.    "

I\'m sure I have never spent 3 minutes brushing my teeth prior to having the wireless timer that comes in the box. The handle feels very substantial in my hand, runs very smoothly, and holds its charge for several days. I previously had the cheaply made $30 Oral-B unit and I disliked using it so much that I\'m sure I hurried to finish and did not clean my teeth very well. It vibrated too much and the brush head was way too small. The SmartSeries 5000 is a joy to use.

And that makes all the difference.,"I have tried so many razors in my year of shaving, and I think I have found the right one. When I first started shaving, about a year ago ( I\'m kinda new to this), I used my moms pink plastic cheapo gillettes that come in packs of like ten. These sucked! Everytime I shaved I would get a new Nick or cut. They didn\'t get all the hair, having only two blades, and irritated my skin. Next, my stepmom bought a pack of cvs brand rip offs of the bic soleil. I thought I was in heaven. These didn\'t Nick quite as much, and had a grippier handle, so there were no slips. I honestly liked this razor, at least compared to those two bladed ones. Then my sister decided to buy herself a Venus spa breeze. I admit to trying it once of twice. This was an even better shave than the cvs ones. The only problem I had where those big shave gel bars. They were slimy and left residue on my legs. I still liked the shave though, but didn\'t want to spend money at the time on sething I wasn\'t completly satisfied with, so I went back to the cvs ones. Finally after hearing my friend raving about the Venus embrace, I thought I\'d try it out. It wasn\'t that expensive, and if I didn\'t like it, I just wodn\'t buy refills. So I bought it. I was in love.The 5 blades cut a little bit closer than the cvs brand \' soleil\'. I didn\'t miss any hairs, even though I only took one pass on each section. I even got a close shave on my knees, thanks to the pivoting head. I also found that my shave took a lot les time. I was done in about half the time it usually took me. I didn\'t even get any cuts.The ribbon of moisture works great. My legs are less irritated than before and it really gave a smooth shave.The soft grip handle was a comfortable fit in my palm. I wouldn\'t say it was grippier than the cvs, but it was certainly a step up from the gillettes.The only thingni felt was not nesasary was the shower pod. Idont keep my razor in the shower anyways, because my younger sis has a tendancy to steal and use my razor. With a razor like this I knew she would want to try it out. The razor is tucked away safely in my room, with the pod in my junk drawer.I give this razor five stars. I am definitly buying the refills.    "

It\'s a pretty tight shave and I think some of that has to do with the \'power\' aspect, which is basically the vibrating movement of the entire razor.I think it gives the best shave of anything I\'ve tried.  I use this on my face and my head and I notice I can skip an extra day, which in the long run saves me time.Highly recommended.    "

Ok not really but it is a sweet little tooth brush. I love that it\'s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue you can put it on soft mode. The charger you see in the picture can actually come apart so you are left with a tiny stand if you want instead of the big face. The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist saying \'you\'re brushing your teeth too hard\' which can be very bad for you. Finally the cost. You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning. My mouth was a little sore but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \'I bet you haven\'t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\' I actually told him that wasn\'t true...I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing. My teeth feel the same as going to a dentist (plus I floss twice a day), every day..what more can you ask for.Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes... you get what you pay for period. People my age find this expensive, but the investment again is just a win-win that pays for itself right away. Did I mention is also really does help whiten teeth with the special head? yeah that\'s awesome also!...oh and the charge really does last all week"

And with these you don\'t feel gross, you\'re extremely comfortable, and they do absorb a lot more than the others. I still leak, but not as much. They\'re definitely not perfect, the wings are a bit too short and the pad itself isn\'t as wide as I\'d like, but I give it 5 stars because it\'s still the best pad on the market."

5410,2237,2289,20101213,B002HWS9GG,5,"December 13, 2010",A2CCL5RDYG0X5N,Great rechargeable toothbrush,"I think most people would agree that the 2 minutes spent brushing your teeth are the longest 2 minutes in the day, however many times per day you brush.Dentists insist that I use an electric toothbrush, otherwise I brush too hard and add to gum recession.  Most dentists put the Oral B\'s at the top of the list, and I\'ve been very pleased with them, but this new one is a leap forward.All because of a simple improvement: it not only divides the mouth into quadrants and gives a little shake to prompt me to move from one quadrant to another, but it has a separate wireless display.  When the brush isn\'t in use, the display serves as a darned good digital clock, and when brushing, it converts into a timer and a map of the four quadrants, depicting which quadrants have been brushed.  Then, once the two minutes have passed, the round quadrant display turns into a smiling face, which grins if you\'ve really been brushing enough.And it\'s the darndest thing, but breaking it up into 4 quadrants not only shortens the perceived brushing time dramatically, but I for one--yes, it\'s embarrassing but true--actually want to \'please\' the display, and get that silly smiley face.  Worse than that, I want to get the big grin on the smiley face!No, I\'m not lonely, I have a lovely girlfriend who brushes right beside me, but we both find that these Oral B\'s turn the longest 2 minutes of the day into an all too short game that seems to last at most 30 seconds.  And the cavity-free dental exams are nice, too.The only negative point: as is the case with all previous Oral B electric toothbrushes I\'ve owned, after even a single brushing it seems to take impossibly long to completely recharge.  I don\'t have any other rechargeable appliance that comes close.  It\'s not much of a problem, but it does seem peculiar."

It gave me such great, long service, I ordered another one through Amazon.  I hoped it would be a another terrific brush and I wasn\'t disappointed. I give the Oral-B Braun lots of stars for ease of use, dependability and it gets in to those hard to reach places with the small round head. The only negative thing I have is that the new stand for it is not as sturdy as the old one and I miss that little green light telling me it is sitting correctly. All in all its a 5 star item.  Amazon also gets 5 stars for its fast and efficient service, quick shipping and great competitive prices.  Be sure to check out their great prices on name brand items.

Even my gums are looking healthier.I almost went with the 4000, but am glad I spent a few bucks more for the 5000, because that little clock/timer thing has, for the first time, gotten me to really pay attention to how long I brush, and I dutifully do the full 30 seconds on each quadrant.From what I\'ve read, the only thing to really watch out for are counterfeit brush head replacements.Would I buy this toothbrush again?
