I have been using Oral B powerbrush for probably 7 years now and I have never had these problems with the brushes.  These that I purchased through Amazon/Trend Marketing slide off the powerhead unit while brushing your teeth.  The bristles felt much harder then any brand new true Oral-B heads I have ever purchased.  After about 3 weeks of use one of the brushes fell apart in my wife\'s mouth...something a real Oral-B manufactured brushhead would never do.

On the webpage itself, the description is correct, but if not looked carefully but just believe the search result, you will think you are buying a proglide. It is confusing.    "

The Fusion does not irritate my skin nor do I get a razor burn with it as I do other brands since I have very sensitive skin. This blade system is so precise I can even dry shave if it is the first use of the blade when I am in a hurry and that would not be possible with any other razor I have ever used, after the first use the blades do dull a bit and I have to use shaving cream or I can get shave burn. The only con I can think of is that they can be a bit pricey if you buy the singles so I would suggest that you either buy the biggest multi pack available to save the most.Update- still the best but I have found an electric shaver that finally gets close to the smoothness, Norelco 3D 1290.

My previous razor was Mach 3 Turbo, and I have never tried any of the fusion razors until now.My initial reaction was that it\'s not that much better than the mach3 razors i have been using.  I remember the feeling of amazement after my first mach 3 shave having switched from a two-blade Schick - but this time, the improvement, if at all, seemed marginal.  I imagine this is what Apple goes through when they release a new iPhone - nothing will match the excitement of the very first model.I am not convinced that the \'thinner blades\' are actually better - seems like this may just be another marketing ploy to get away with cheaper materials.With all that said, I tried using the proglide a few more times and thought that it worked consistently well every time - and I was actually able to get a very close shave with a single path \'against the grain\', and without any skin irritation at all.  Something I was not able to do with any other razor.    "

Also since using it, and  using it almost exclusively during same 3-4 years, have had at least 50% less plaque/tartar deposits for my dentist\'s office to clean at my regular semi-annual check-ups--a fact much appreciated by same professionals and one that more than one dental hygienist has noted on countless patients who regularly use such brushes.  Oh, btw, when it comes time to replace the brush on these little jewels try to buy same replacement from your dentist office.  My dentist charges essentially at-cost, approximately $6 USD, for replacement brushes for my model while our local dept. stores charge anywhere from about $17-23 USD."

Usually the other reviews merely validate my own opinion.  Rarely do I find myself disagreeing with the reviews significantly.  Although I am rating the item 4 stars like most I do find the reasons for complaint or praise are different from myself and my fellow reviewers.Pros:1.  Light smell.  Many seem to complain about the strong smell.  I find it not too strong.  Maybe this is my nose not working but I find it pleasant.2.  Shirt friendly.  I have seen a few reviewers complain about the shirt staining.  I recommend you change detergent.  I have never had a problem with staining of shirts or even residue during the day.3.  Glides well for a non-gel stick.  I like the application of gels but this does a nice job and does not pull hair.Cons:1.  The mix is so water repellent that washing it off in the shower is a bit of a pain.  A minor issue but one I am reminded of each morning.A very good stick that is easy in application and seems effective in odor and moisture control.  Nicely done.

The reviews and the rebate attracted me to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. I especially liked the polishing mode, since I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth. I didn\'t think that I\'d use the clock/timer/sensor, but I decided to put it up to have a small clock in my bathroom. I\'m using it all of the time! I give my teeth a \'spa treatment\' - floss, polish, massage gums...and feel like I\'ve had a professional cleaning. Having always been a diligent brusher, I was surprised to see that I could benefit from the reminder to brush each of the four areas for 30 seconds. The little warning light that tells me when I\'m exerting pressure (and thus brushing too hard - all you have to do is hold the brush up to the surface of the tooth and let it do the cleaning) is useful for breaking a bad habit that seems to crop up in the same place quite often.I even like the smiley face as a reward for good brushing, although I usually tend to be rather jaded about such things. I think that I\'ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. And I\'m also glad for the travel case since I hated to make trips without my Bruan (you just can\'t got back to manual brushing after you\'re brushed this well), but I\'d find that the \'on\' button sometimes got pressed in my luggage and used up the charge.

The Pulsonic seems a bit flimsy- like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  I also don\'t feel like the bristles get in between my teeth like the Sonicare did, either.  The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn\'t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.

I was quite surprised that after two weeks using the Proglide that I have to say it does indeed provide a better shave than the previously mentioned model. I\'m not sure it it\'s the thinner blades that seem to offer much less resistance both against the grain as well as with it, or one of the other features. The power version also has a feature that claims to guide the hairs in straighter for a more close, even cut. While I\'m not sure if this is a gimmick or not, the proof seems to be in the proverbial pudding. For me, the shaves have been much better with less irritaion, and so far the blades seem to last longer than the old version. On the older version I could only get three good shaves at the most before feeling it was time to replace them. With the proglide I only have had to change the blades once in two weeks, and the performance has always been fantastic. Of course, these statements are just my \'two cents\' worth, as shaving is very subjective and there are so many factors that go in to a great shave. But for my purposes, this new Proglide seems to fit the bill very nicely.    "

I was beginning to think that the competition to create a razor with the largest number of blades was getting ridiculous. I starting shaving my legs with the original single blade razors which did often cause embarrassing scrapes and cuts. The twin blade was a much heralded advance that resulted in a better shave and less abrasions. I even bought into the triple blade and was impressed, but  I drew the line at the quattro. This was getting ridiculous. Soon we would not have to move the instrument more than a millimeter to shave an entire calf. Come on!?The free vine product enticed me to try the Embrace five blade razor and its a winner. The shave was safe and incredibly smooth.

My \'qualified 5 star rating\' is given because the improvement of this razor over my first 5 blade manual Gillette is no where near the improvement seen in moving from the 3 blade to 5 blade system.  There is no night and day difference.  I would not be surprised if the razor by Gillette testing is an improvement.  But the difference I believe is too small to discern for an average user.  It may come down to whether you like the vibration.  I will say that I have not determined if the vibration helps prevent the buildup of hair between the blades which is feasible.  Nevertheless, I love this razor.  It is entirely optional whether you use the power capability or not.  And relative to my older manual 5 blade the handle on this Proglide is much more rounded and comfortable.  It is not heavy at all and in fact is likely very light yet solid if you remove the battery. So I would recommend giving it a try and figure out for yourself how you prefer to use it.  My one caveat at for this early review is that I have not been able to determine how long the blades last but do not expect that to be significantly different, and if I am not mistaken the older blades still fit as well.

I will also say that my beard typically comes in patchy and the hair on my face is usually pretty coarse.  Everyone\'s face is different and this should be taken into consideration.  This razor feels very comfortable in my hand and perhaps even lighter than most razors.  Traditionally, I have shyed away from Gillette razors as they have a tendency to provide a more painful shave for me.  There seems to be more tugging and pulling then other razors I have used.  I have always found that a Schick Titanium typically gives me a more comfortable shave.  The Proglide is no exception as I still found it to be pulling a bit much to my disappointment.  I also noticed a bit more irritation on my face the next day, but nothing too bad.  However, I will say that this is, by far, the closest shave I have ever had with any razor.  I believe I actually said \'wow\' when I was done shaving.  In my mind I had to determine what the trade off was.  More comfortable versus closest shave.  For now, I am sticking with the Gillette in hopes that my face gets a little more used to it.I knocked off two stars for the following reasons:1) Price!  The razor is not too expensive, but a 4 pack of blades is about $16 at my local gorcery store.  By far, the most expensive blades in the aisle.2) Lack of comfort...it tugs and pulls a bit...and left my face slightly irritated.Overall, its a good razor.  It\'s not quite a comfortable as the Schick I used, but I am pretty darn excited at how close the shave is.    "

He\'s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.His current razor is a Mach 3, so he did side by side comparisons between that one and this Fusion Proglide. He did the typical half-the-face test where he shaved each half with one of the razors. He did comparison tests where he tried it powered and non-powered.For all of these tests, the result - the shave closeness - was about the same. This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.As for the *process* of shaving. running the Fusion Proglide with the power off felt similar to using the Mach 3. However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \'pull\' - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  I\'ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.He was expecting the trimmer blade to be pretty useless - but it turns out it was pretty convenient for trimming. You can\'t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.He used it for a half dozen shaves, and the blade still has a little life left, which is on par with a Mach 3.For people who already have a Mach 3 and didn\'t care about the \'shaving process itself\', there\'s no real reason to change blades. People who are having issues with tugging and pulling might appreciate the smoother shaving experience with the Proglide.On the issue of blade cost, if you buy the Proglide blades in bulk, you can get blades closer to $3 a blade. Still, this can seem expensive compared with other options.In the end we\'re hoping when we run out of Mach 3 blades that the blades for this one might have dropped in price and we\'ll move over to the Proglide. However, but it\'s not like we\'d toss out the Mach 3 and the existing blades in order to use this.    "

That\'s one big advantage of the Oral B -- you can buy different heads to use for different purposes. The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.My only complaint is that there\'s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it\'s fully charged or when the charge is low. It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors. When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working.

The matching shampoo was a terrible disappointment however (leaving my hair feeling unclean and coated in a non-slippery way) -- so I tried this conditioner with several other shampoos (both Pantene and non-Pantene sorts).  The best results came after  something like Pantene\'s old Ice Shine shampoo -- though still, only average smoothing and mild taming of my locks, which definitely felt over-coated even after a thorough rinsing.I second what an earlier reviewer said about silicone -- it\'s a shortcut for curly hair that seems to pay you back later in buildup and less-than-satisfactory results in the long run, and it\'s disappointing to find it in this product.I wouldn\'t go out of my way to recommend this conditioner, though I\'ll keep it on hand to use when I\'m out of everything else!

It\'s also relatively portable, so good for travel too, though you\'ll need to bring the charger along for longer trips.The Pulsonic is not as gentle on your teeth and gums as most of the more expensive toothbrushes I\'ve owned, but I haven\'t had any problems with it. It just feels like the motor does not run quite as fast or as smoothly and I think that probably makes it a little less effective at getting your teeth completely clean. It is certainly a lot better than my old manual toothbrush though! Overall I think it works very well.I bought it about a month after my previous (2-3X the price) electric brush broke, so I\'d been using a manual brush for a bit. After a week of using the Pulsonic my teeth were noticeably whiter and have gotten whiter since then. I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past- my soda drinking youth eventually caught up with me I guess:(. I\'ve had this brush for a year and my dentist says my teeth and gums are in great shape.My only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn\'t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right? If you\'re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don\'t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic."

If any of you are out there like me the razors of the past just didnt hold up well, tugged at your hair, and had to be thrown away after a couple of uses.  After a couple months of use with my new proglide fusion power it is absolutely the best razors money can buy.  I can shave every morning now without fear of razor burn, tugs, and cuts.  Besides all of that the blades give a me a good shave for a minimum of a month and a half.  Again being a guy with a thick beard this is a godsend!

Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It\'s kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

The razors are materially more expensive than the Mach 3. It\'s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money. If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I\'d go with this one.2. The razors are thinner. I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.3. Amazon has great info and instructions. The razor itself does not. It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box. For example, I really wasn\'t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head.

One would think that I wouldn\'t balk at having to replace these Gillette cartridges, but their price just does not justify their performance.I started shaving using the Gillette Sensor Excel when I was a teenager.  I upgraded to the Gillette Mach3 when it came out, and I was pretty happy with the results.  Now, after a year of using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide, I\'m going back to the Mach3.The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide does provide a close shave.  It\'s the closest I\'ve ever had, to be honest.  The problem is that the blades get too dull to use within a week.  Oh, I could still use them, but then I\'d be tugging at hair instead of cutting through the hair.  My Mach3\'s cartridges would last three months before hitting the waste basket.  And the vibrating mechanism doesn\'t do a lick of good, either.  I have had just as good of results when leaving the battery powered vibrator off.Now, if I could afford to spend $100 a year on razor cartridges, I would stick with the Pro Glide.  But when there are cheaper alternatives that don\'t do all that poorly in their own right, there is only one decision that makes sense.    "

Despite the name change from \'Triumph\' to \'SmartSeries,\' there are no differences except for the charger-toothbrush-holding-stand, which has changed from a tall rounded design (which was a pain to assemble and disassemble) to a elongated flattened rectangle.  In fact, if you look at the handle of your SmartSeries 5000, it says, \'Triumph.\'  All of these toothbrushes are the same design, except the 9400 doesn\'t interface with the SmartSeries clock.I have noticed that the price point has stayed similar over the years, and now Oral-B is consistently including the \'SmartGuide,\' which is a little clock-like contraption that gives signals (e.g., time, time of brush, too much pressure, etc.).  This toothbrush is convenient and does a pretty good job of keeping your teeth much cleaner and whiter than manual brushing.  My dentist doesn\'t scold me as much during cleanings any more.One caveat: My husband\'s Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries) had a bearing go out within six months of normal use.  The SmartSeries clock would flash the \'red triangle\' (brushing with too much pressure) caution and the toothbrush would buzz uncomfortably throughout the brushing process.  Although the toothbrush originally cost us around $149, we couldn\'t find the original sales receipt in order to claim the warranty.  Finally, after complaining about it for a year-and-a-half, we accepted the hit to the pocketbook and replaced his malfunctioning Triumph 9900 with the SmartSeries 5000... which was surprisingly the same toothbrush despite the name change.In short:- The price at MSRP is the equivalent of 30 regular toothbrushes, but it does a very good job when it works- This toothbrush is a good buy from Amazon due to significant price decrease (major retailers are still selling it at MSRP)- The SmartSeries 5000 (with SmartSeries) is the same as the Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries)- Keep your receipt for potential warranty issues! Better to be safe than sorry, and $160 poorer due to replacement cost (like us)- 10 hours to fully charge, about 10 days of charge at 2x brushings/day- Standalone charger is convenient to detach from brush-holder for extra counter room or to take on trips"

There are ten tampons for light days, thirty for regular usage, and then the ten super duper size needed for those extra heavy moments.My daughter swears by this product and will purchase no other.

My mom bought me a pack of these at a local drugstore MONTHS ago and I\'m still only on my second blade.  During the winter I usually only shave my armpits daily, and since my leg hair doesn\'t grow much in the winter anyway, I only shave them once every week or so.  The small amount of use has probably contributed to keeping the razor clean and sharp.  I leave it in the shower everyday, but I always make sure it stays on a shelf where no water accumulates, so that probably helps too.The moisturizing strip has long since been depleted, but I really don\'t notice a difference in the shave.I usually hold the razor near the bottom and rest my middle finger lightly on top of the actual razor part, because it seems like if I don\'t, it won\'t have enough pressure to get every nook and cranny.  It\'s not really a design flaw; I like it because it gives me a lot more control over the pressure.  The flexible head is AMAZING.  If you\'ve always used cheap one-piece disposables, you are missing out.  I have probably only gotten cut once or twice with this razor (around the ankles--mostly my fault for not being careful enough), when I used to get razor burn and cuts EVERY SHAVE with non-flexible one-piece razors.I strongly suggest you buy these.

Because there is so much more surface area in the blade design it really is a breeze to shave.I have quite senitive skin, and I can now finally shave everyday with out getting cut up.HOWEVER... If you leave your face unshaved for more than 3 days... like a full weekend.  It doesnt shave as well.  The long hairs get caught up in the blades and almost rip out.  The Mach 3 does a much better job at long hairs.  It is possible to shave with the fusion, but it takes a longer time since you have to keep rining it out every inch of a shave.I had this razor since the first day it came out.  The best thing  I have noticed is that each blade lasts about 2 weeks. My Mach 3 usually lasted a week.  ( Like i said i have senstive skin and once the blade starts going, my face gets all cut up. )  So blades are more expensive but they do last longer.Overall.

This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives. While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.Second thing to note, this shouldn\'t be a flossing replacement. You\'d think it\'d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely unnecessary.Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.So, with that, you\'d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right? Well, maybe not. For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn\'t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush. I don\'t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn\'t feel radically different from using a medium bristle brush.These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth clean.Finally, these heads seem to fit my teeth perfect, but I should note, I have a large mouth and large teeth. As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they\'d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/mouths.All in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone."

I find it shaves like the old BIC disposables. I have not had razor burn this bad in years. In fact, I can not remember having this bad of razor burn, ever. Even the disposable Mach-3 shaves better than this SO-CALLED \'best most comfortable shave\'...I will not be enjoying this misery again. Thank goodness it came with the other stuff or I would feel extremely cheated. As of now, I am just feeling mildly cheated. Do not waste your money on this bit of advertising hype. There is absolutely no improvement over the three bladed razors and in fact is much more UN-comfortable than any razor I have ever used.I gave it two (2) stars because well, it did shave.

I use all 3 different brush heads provided, but mainly stick to one speed, the daily cleaning.  I use the unit set on \'airplane\' mode, as a wireless display of where I am at what time in my mouth is just silly, a waste of a battery, and needless exposure to rf waves to boot.  One other downside is that the charger is in the plug, which sticks out @ 3 1/2 inches from the outlet, not a good look for a small bathroom counter.So, in future I will look for a non-Smart model and will remain perfectly stupid and happy with it.

It also helped at the time that there was a 50% rebate from Oral-B (which was received in 3 weeks, not bad for a rebate). So for one, it was a good deal at a post-rebate of $54.99.This was a perfect set-up for my husband and me. It came with a floss head and I already had a whitening brush head. When we unpacked, we set it up next to the counter plug (I don\'t like to have wires spread everywhere) and placed the timer on the mirror at my eye level.The timer shows a round diagram (to represent your mouth) and it times 30 seconds a section. Then you get a big smile and a wink for the time after 2 minutes. The timer display also shows what mode you are like normal or gentle and if you are brushing too hard.The brush has been working well for both my husband and I. The brush does make noise, and since there is not doorseparating our sink from the bedroom, I do have to go into the enclosed toilet/ bathtub room to brush when my husband is sleeping. Also, there is only one brush so you either have to brush one after another or use another oral-B professional brush, which we already had (the Professional 1000).My husband dentist thanked him for flossing (which he doesn\'t), and my dentist said that my gums looked a lot healthier and my teeth were very white. My dentist even is going to order me 2 new brush heads every time I come in (about every 6 months) instead of the standard toothbrush.I would recommend this brush to everyone. I know that all can\'t afford them, so I tell them to watch for rebates, when you can get them cheap. They save you at the dentist (with less cavities).

They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you\'ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn\'t work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife\'s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you\'re used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I\'m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn\'t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I\'ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I\'m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit."

There were about two shaves worth of this in the sample I received. I used one and immediately threw the rest in the trash.It was like trying to shave with Crisco. It was very oily and hard to wash off my hands. It did the worst job of softening my beard of ANY shaving cream or gel I\'ve ever used, then after the shave, was equally difficult to completely wash the residue off my face.The (brand new) razor blade was left with this stuff gunked up between the blades as if I had run it through a can of solid Crisco shortening. I don\'t know how much hot water (VERY hot) I had to use before it finally all washed out of the blades, but it was far too much.The shave itself was similar to when I\'ve been caught on a trip without shaving cream and used bath soap to lather with, in that it makes it possible, but not comfortable. I\'d rather use bath soap to shave with than this stuff, and I\'m not exaggerating in making that statement.I have used Edge shaving gel for years. In contrast to this product, Edge does not leave an oily residue on my hands, does soften my beard (and my beard is a bit on the tough side), does not need intense scrubbing to remove from my face, and does not imbed itself into the razor blades. With Edge and a new blade, I never have any \'pull\' on a shave. My first, last, and only shave with this mess was an irritating pull on every shaving stroke (yes, with a brand new first time ever used blade).I\'m a big fan of the Fusion razors, but whoever invented this junk, and anyone else in the company that green-lighted it for sale, should be horse whipped.

I tried this shampoo out because I\'ve had some good experiences with Pantene in the past and thought there was a chance that it might buoy my hair up at least just a tad!It certainly smells very nice and cleans my hair very well.  Some shampoos are less effective for me to the extent that I have to wash my hair more than once a day if I don\'t want it to become very oily; this shampoo definitely kept that from happening.  It also doesn\'t seem to leave any residue or buildup.On the other hand, I definitely didn\'t leave the house with suddenly voluminous hair. It was its flat, shiny, normal self.  But, like the guy who kept asking God if he could win the lottery and never bought a ticket, I\'m guessing you\'d have to meet the product half way to get results.  I\'d be reluctant to say that it didn\'t help with volume at all until I\'d given the blowdrier and curling iron a shot.Until then, it\'s a good shampoo, it does its job, and I\'ll continue to use it.

Recently, I have been forced by them to move to Schick.  Not happy with being a virtual monopoly when it comes to men\'s shavers Gilette decides to over-engineer and to greedily get more profits by going so overboard that they have successfully made me give up on them after decades of being a loyal consumer.  As other reviewers have alluded to I actually got cut a couple of times which has never happened before!  I\'ve come to realise that the battery operated vibrator is a gimmick that does nothing at all to get a closer shave except to cause more batteries to be consumed and to fill up our landfills.  Thankfully, I\'ve been using rechargables for years and hence haven\'t had to buy batteries for years.  For people like me with sharper facial features, this 5-bladed \'wonder\' has such a large amount of rubber that it makes the overall blade area too high/thick (the breadth or height i.e. the vertical edge of the blade) to cover my chin area below my cheeks close enough without cutting my face.  Quite clearly the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns doesn\'t dawn on them when clearly there is a limit to the number of blades before you actually start spoiling the product!  For me it seems any \'improvement\' from going to 5 from 4 blades is so negligible to be non-existent in addition to giving me multiple cuts as the blades now do not contact my face as closely as before when I go from my cheek to my neck area.Unlike Schick where all their blades fit on all their holders greedy Gillette makes us \'upgrade\' to various blades by having to buy ever new blade holders.  Not content with profits from the blades alone, they have to insist on us buying the new holders to increase their revenues.Sick with the blatant exploitation of consumers, I have tried for the first time I can remember the Schick Quattro and I am happy now to get a close shave without cuts for a lower price knowing that any future blade enhancements will still fit my blade holder.Thanks Gillette for pushing me to your competitors; I didn\'t know what I was missing until now.Definitely NOT recommended!

More blades, more power, and whatever else their powerful marketing machine is able to drum up.  However, coming from the standard Fusion line, I can\'t believe the difference this razor makes.  Maybe it\'s the vibration, maybe it IS the thinner blades, but whatever it is, it works.My beard is very coarse and grows like a caveman.  I can be completely smooth in the morning and by 7:00 at night, my face feels like sandpaper.  Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  The ProGlide is like butter.  Easily lumberjacking the thousands of mini pine trees that decorate my face.  This is my first experience with a \'powered\' razor.  I\'ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  Perhaps this is the reason the ProGlide feels to smooth.  Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  My face stays smooth ALL DAY.  I do have to shave the next morning, but if I wanted to, I could go into work (like I did today) with a minor sandpaper face.  However there is a cost for all of this handsomeness and it\'s the cost of those blades.  $3.30/each from Costco.  That\'s outrageous, but my wife does love a smooth face and I can\'t deny her that.    "

It\'s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.  To the couple of reviewers that say they couldn\'t tell the difference, I\'d say you\'re either shaving wrong or do not have sensitive skin.  With the Fusion Power, I\'d pretty much have to shave in the shower to avoid razor burn on my neck.  With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving -- no razor burn at all (or ingrown hairs), even shaving against the grain on my neck.Here\'s what a lot of the reviewers are missing. On the Fusion Power, I had to change blades every 7-10 days. Any more than that and I\'d get torn up. I\'m in my TENTH week of using the Power Proglide blades, and I\'m on my THIRD BLADE!!! It\'s JUST about time to change, but I could still probably handle another shave or two with no less comfort than I had with the regular Fusion Power blades. 3 BLADES in 67 days!!  And the other cool thing is that these blades work perfectly on the Fusion Power chassis, so no need to buy the new Power Proglide razor (unless you just want to upgrade for the looks).So yes, individually, the blades ARE more expensive than any other blade. But the cost savings, even over just a year, will be SIGNIFICANT for me -- almost $60/year vs. the Fusion Power... AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHAVE EVER??? It\'s a no brainer!!Update:  Still LOVING this shaver almost a year later.  I did determine that what you\'re using for shaving cream makes a BIG difference.  I\'ve used Neutrogena for Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream for years, but decided to try an organic one from Kiss Your Face.  Lots of razor burn and discomfort with that cream, even with a brand new blade (tried it for two days).  So, back to the Neutrogena and couldn\'t be happeier with the Fusion Power ProGlide.    "

Great product!I\'ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in it\'s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I\'ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don\'t know what they\'re talking about. I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down. Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.Don\'t hesitate to purchase a Pulsonic. But shop around for replacement heads. I found there\'s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive. However, this Pulsonic has two speeds, and she has found the slower speed to be perfect for her.Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he\'s happy with it too.

2444,2024,2096,20100610,B003987CL0,5,"June 10, 2010",A2H2I5FY1PUHP1,Five Stars From a Life Long Shick User,"To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.I\'ll begin by saying that I\'ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.ProGlide vs. Hydro 5Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.What\'s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette\'s as a travel holder with no problem.Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro\'s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as \'suspension\' for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.On initial \'hefting\' the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.The Shave TestAll of the above are secondary to the \'Yes, But How Does It Shave\' test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream and a badger bristle brush.Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \'razor burn\' marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \'dried\' she still said the Gillette side was smoother.Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.ProGlide vs QuattroShave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.So what\'s not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn\'t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.    "

I now use a simple old fashion safety razor which works great and the blades are dirty cheap.  Now I won\'t disagree that the Fusion cuts fine and I can shave in record time without fear of removing my Adam\'s apple but $4 a blade is just robbery.  For the most part I think I\'ll stick to safety razor for the bulk of my shaving and then finish up the \'scary\' areas with the Fusion.  This prolongs the life of the Fusion.  The safety razor actually works better if you let your whiskers grow longer as since it\'s single blade it never clogs.If you currently use the old Fusion then I fail to see any benefit in this new model.  I\'m sure they have some lovely marketing but in the end it\'s 98% the same and I couldn\'t tell the difference.  Perhaps the biggest fluff is the \'power\' feature.  It\'s completely useless and IMO is just an attempt to add another disposable item to this razor.  I\'m not sure who asked for their razor to shake in their hands but that\'s not what I want while I\'m shaving around my lips or throat.  I wound up keeping it off while I shave.  I\'m also still not a fan of the flip back behavior of the Fusion... I prefer the head to stay still but since this isn\'t new then maybe you\'re fine with it.Overall it\'s a fine razor, but it\'s a marketing (not engineering) upgrade with goals to charge you just a bit more per blade but it\'s already too much IMO.

Well, the Venus Embrace does.It starts with the handle, which is coated with some new and soft gel-like material. Even holding the razor with wet and soapy hands is not a problem - the grip remains very secure, no effort at all.Using the Embrace is absolutely pleasant. For the first time since I began using such razors it didn\'t feel \'dangerous\' or as if my skin was being scraped - the new \'Ribbon of Moisture\' is a great and very noticeable step up from the previous \'moisture strips\' Gillette used. The 5 blades also feel totally safe. As a matter of fact they do what is advertised and feel like they actually adjust to the contours of the skin. I was truly impressed, because other razor models had made such claims before but I had never been able to actually feel that.Lastly, the results are equally great. I had used the Venus Vibrance before and find that the Embrace does a much better job. I can\'t stop touching my skin - it feels so incredibly smooth. The storage unit, the \'Shower Pod\', is nice and practical but nothing out of the ordinary and in itself not a reason to buy the Embrace.All in all, Gillette has definitely created a winner here, and I will stick with this model for a long time to come.

That all changed when we received the Fusion Proglide Power Razor.  My  husband is resistant to trying anything new, so it took some nudging to get him to try this.  In the past, he bought whatever was on sale and used it until he hated it and tried something new.  He has very sensitive skin and could not use an electric razor, so he wasn\'t very keen on something that sounded suspiciously like it might be a hybrid of old and new.  Once he used it, he was delighted. In 30 plus years, I have never known his face to be so smooth and free of stubble. This is possibly the best shave he has ever gotten, and it left his skin smooth as a baby\'s face, and in great condition.  The shave was close, smooth, and he actually enjoyed using the razor.  He also told me to leave it alone, and to buy my own!  There are coupons in the papers this week, so I am going to do just that, and buy the one made for women.  This is a really great product.  It fits nicely in the hand, it\'s got an interesting shape, and it does what it promised to do.  I have very sensitive skin, and in the past when he rubbed his face against mine, I got red angry patches on my cheeks.  Not even a hint of it this time, so we are both very pleased with this product.  It seemed to float over his skin, and it left it in the best condition that I have ever seen.  I don\'t think anything would persuade him to going back to his old razors, and in fact, he did throw them out!  This is a great product, and we highly recommend it.    "

Use gentle short swipes as the super thin blades do not require you to gash your face in order to get a close shave.You should also note that this razor has a single blade trimmer on the back side for areas that require precision such as side burns and under the nose.The refills may be expensive, but they are worth it. You can use them several times before they need to be replaced.    "

The shave is close, smooth and free from razor burn. The lack of razor burn is remarkable with a new blade.But the extra single-blade is another matter altogether.  Because the main 5-blade setup is so big, some provision had to be made for tight spots like under the nose.  It\'s an old-fashioned single blade. I really don\'t remember when I last used a single blade.  I think that\'s why I dislike shaving. Oww, yes, it\'s that old-time razor burn in spades.So after any shave you can contrast the burn beneath your nose with the smooth, closely-shaved, unharmed skin on the rest of your face.After their big-buck R & D efforts, Gillette needs a way to solve this.(Or use a Mach III under your nose and the new Fusion  on the rest of your beard.)BTW, somehow they seem to have solved the clogged-blade problem that haunted the 4-bladed Shick Quattro.

I received the Gillette Fusion as a free promo and decided to try it. The initial sensation of having 5 blades scrape across my face was a bit unsettling (I imagined a layer of skin being shaved off) but the results were startling. Very close and comfortable shave -- only the beard was removed, not the skin. Single blade on the reverse side works fine for trimming sideburns and under the nose. I used the first blade for 22 shaves and did not nick myself once. I could only get 6-7 shaves out of a Sensor blade so, for me, the high price for Fusion blades is justified.    "

There wasn\'t much info/reviews at the time, but what was out there was positive.  So I went back the next day and got it.  After using manual toothbrushes for our entire lives, my husband and I were very surprised how much cleaner our teeth felt.  Like I said, we have never used an electric one before, so this is not a comparison of other electric toothbrushes.  My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual so it\'s not that important to me.  I am still amazed at the length of the charge, we can go a week with two people using it twice daily.  The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  I have found some info about defective and/or counterfit heads.  It is still going strong after almost 2 years of daily use, with no sign of lessening power or charge.  Overall, I think the price and quality of this toothbrush make it a great option."

Also just like the old Fusion blades, you have to be really absent minded to get a nick. I\'d say on average I get about 4-10 shaves out of them before I become frustrated and throw them away.

There is absolutely no way this is a 4- or 5-star product. I call shill.I\'ll start with the few good things about the razor:1. It feels very nice in hand. The \'grippies\' are in just the right place. It has a nice heft with the battery in. The size and shape fit the hand nicely.2. It looks very cool. I really like the orange and grey/silver meme that has been going through design the past few years. If anyone watches you shave, they will be impressed seeing you with this. However, I, for one, typically shave alone so this isn\'t worth much.3. The battery level indicator is very cool and effective. It\'s hard to describe, but I wish everything I own that uses batteries had this indicator.4. The single blade on the back of the razor is brilliant. It\'s not as effective as I\'d like, but it is much better at keeping a sharp sideburn line than the five blades. I suspect the angle/ position will be worked out in the future.Now the bad:1. It doesn\'t shave any better than any other razor I\'ve ever used. Yeah, it gives a pretty close shave. But my tried and true Sensor Excel blades, the handle of which I purchased in 1996, give just as close of a shave without any of the other problems listed below.2. It\'s very expensive. $30 for 8 cartridges?! Ridiculous. Absolutely not worth it. The Sensor Excel 8 pack is literally half the price - still more than I think they are worth - but gives a better shave.3. I\'ve never had a more uncomfortable shave. The blades catch my stubble, making for a very slow shave. Yes, of course, shaving with the \'grain\' of your beard reduces this problem but it still happens. Most people have swirling grain somewhere on their face. This razor makes shaving those areas very difficult and slow going.4. The blades have a short lifespan. I am only able to get 3-4 shaves out of a head before the stubble-catching problem gets so bad I can\'t use it. By contrast, my Sensor Excel blades easily last 7-8 shaves - about two weeks, though by the 7th or 8th shave it is catching pretty bad too. My straight edge doesn\'t have this problem at all, given a quick run over the strop before each shave.The overall experience is expensive and uncomfortable and results in a mediocre shave. It is a disappointing product and not worth the investment.    "

The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads. Its great to see Gillette has done what store brands have done long ago, add the 3 blade and it does work better than the others, but the two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving. Don\'t waste money on more expensive newer models, if you have this one or can get this one, blades are cheaper and it does better, Gillette sensor blades last longer.    "

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  The number after the dash (for example EB17-3) just means how many toothbrush heads you\'ll be receiving.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads."

Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  This is an excellent product. 4.5 Stars*** Positive Points: ***- Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)- Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3). The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).- It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base. You simply stick the raised portion of the charger into the end of the brush.- Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries- Brush vibrates to let you know when you have gone over the recommended 2 minute brush time.- 2 year warranty*** Negative Points: ***- Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.- There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.- The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouthOverall:  This toothbrush cannot be beat for its price.

I have fairly thick hair that I keep mine cut short so if Pro-v was going to give my hair volume I would hardly notice. Overall I was pleased with the shampoo and it literally left my hair squeaky clean. I\'m not sure if that\'s necessarily a good thing since according to my wife that squeak is caused when shampoo strips the oil from your hair. I needed to continue to use my Head and Shoulders occasionally because the Pro-v doesn\'t seem to help with dandruff. The Pro-v was fine but I didn\'t notice a huge difference with other shampoos. 
3229,56,57,20050308,B00006ANDJ,5,"March 8, 2005",A2WXIJTI5PEV9N,Making a dent in the war against tooth decay,"This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said \'this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth\' or some such statement like that. Well, I haven\'t lost one yet.The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.Since I\'ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I\'m using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it\'s kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.Enjoy life!"

So please do NOT think this is only targeted toward girls with extra heavy flow.  If you\'re like me and always get so paranoid about leakage at night that you end up lying stiff straight on your bed and always sleep badly during your period, then THIS IS FOR YOU.I stumbled across this one by accident, as not all stores carry this particular size (at least not a couple of years ago).  Ever since then there is not a single day in my house that I don\'t have a pack of this stored in my cabinet, it\'s THAT essential.As I said before, I tend to sleep really badly during my period because i\'m so paranoid of moving at night and allowing leakage onto my sheets (which are a pain to wash out!)  Let\'s just say my crankiness during that time isn\'t all attributed to hormones!  After I started using this one though, aside from the usual cramps and back soreness, nothing else would affect my sleep.This pad is almost like twice the size of a normal day-time heavy pad, or 1.5x size of the old overnight pad I used to use.  The best thing about this, is that not only is it super long so that it covers all the way up to the top of your butt crack, it also has extra wing in that back area that spreads out and allows for more protection.  If you ever had issues where the old overnight is long enough, but liquid would leak on the side when you sleep on your side, then this will get rid of that problem.It is a huge pad though (my friend, who never used it before, when she saw me buying it she thought it was as big as a diaper x___x ) but I wouldn\'t want any thinner pad (even in the same shape and size) if only because the thinner it is, the less i feel protected.  And no matter what, I always want to be protected from leakage, not to mention being able to sleep better!also i only use this for the first 2-4 days or until the flow gets slow so that leakage won\'t really happen any more.  during the day or during the trailing part of my period, i switch back to regular sized pads."

It is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I\'ve owned, and my last one lasted 13 years. When it started to loose its charge while I was brushing my teeth I looked at what was available and decided on the 5000.I like that it has a space to store 4 brush heads, so I won\'t have to search for where I placed the extra ones when its time to change it. Also, the contour of the handle is very nice.On one of the reviews I read before I bought it, someone was unhappy with the timer. It\'s a nice, waterproof digital clock and you do not have to sync it up with the toothbrush if you don\'t want to. I did so I could tell when I\'m applying too much pressure. If you do use the timer, at 2 minutes you get a smiley face, and at 2 1/2 minutes it winks at you.The one thing I don\'t really like is that every 30 seconds it pulses to let you know to move to the next area of your mouth, but I do not brush my teeth in sections like they want you to. I asked my Dental Hygienist, who also uses one, and she doesn\'t do it their way either.She also recommended that I leave the handle off the charger until the charge wears down. The toothbrush has a \'Smart\' battery and she has heard of people having problems with the battery not holding a charge if it is keep constantly charging. The handle shows how much charge the battery has so I only charge it once a week or so.The travel case that comes with it is another nice feature. Since it holds a charge well, you can take a weekend trip, or a week, if only one person is using the handle, without having to pack the charger. There is room for two brush heads in the travel case."

I can sympathize.  When you go as far as to skip shaving because it\'s too expensive, you know there\'s a problem.However, I\'ve found that the Fusion blades are, like the Mach 3 before them, worth the extra cost.  I have very thick, fast-growing facial hair, which earned me more than my share of scrutiny when I was in the military.  Therefore, I need razors that can cut through it without excessive strokes that each take a bit of skin with them.The Mach 3 was a huge improvement over dual-blade razors for me, and for quite a while I stuck with those rather than paying a premium for the Fusion 5-blades.  Also affecting my decision was the old Onion article: \'**** Everything, We\'re Doing Five Blades,\' which reinforced my perception that a five-bladed razor was nothing but a marketing gimmick.And perhaps it is - but it shaves noticeably better than the Mach 3, either because of the additional blades or some other less-obvious improvements.  Not only do I get a better shave with fewer strokes, but I can even skip a couple days and then cut through the beginnings of a hoary beard with little effort.And even better, the new razors seem to last longer than the Mach 3s, giving half a dozen shaves or more before they need replacement.  The Mach 3s gave up the ghost after just 3 or so.I certainly recommend these razors if the cost is not a huge obstacle, especially if you\'ve got facial hair from hell like I do.    "

Then we went back to manual toothbrushes for a while.  We realized that the manual toothbrushes didn\'t leave our mouths feeling as clean as the rechargeable toothbrushes, so we decided to purchase a Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.We purchased the Sonicare from Amazon and tried it for a couple weeks.  At first, we thought it did a very good job cleaning our teeth and gums, but it started feeling weak.  I\'m not sure if the toothbrush lost its full power after the first week, but the pulsating just didn\'t seem as good as our older Oral B.We returned it to Amazon as it seemed defective, and purchased the Oral B Professional Series 5000.  We\'ve used it for a few days now and it draws rings around the Sonicare.  The oscillating motion of the toothbrush alone leaves our teeth, gums, and overall mouth feeling much cleaner than anything we\'ve ever used; feels almost as good as a cleaning from the dentist.I highly recommend this toothbrush over the Sonicare.  Also, we are using the Oral B Floss brush heads.  They are tremendous and are much cheaper than the Sonicare brush heads as well."

I have owned each for about 8 months now and I have to say that each brush has its own pros/cons and this is her favorite.  The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior/interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes some adjustment on the part of the operator.  I found that my gums could handle the Sonicare, but my girlfriend gums are more sensitive and she uses this Oral-B exclusively.  The motion of the brush is much more softer and the replaceable brushes tend to fit right over each tooth.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  I like having the ability to brush my tongue which is much more difficult with this brush."

I am a flosser by nature as well..and I noticed after several days of usage...that my flossing showed less and less particles between my teeth. And those particles came out easier - even popcorn!What\'s really nice is it comes with and extra brush - either for use with two peeople or use one as your back up and it plugs into the wall nicely. There is no battery replacement however because it is magnetically charged the hand unit does not plug intothe wall. Free from cord or plug issues being close to water.It was packed well and comes complete with operational instructions as well as infomation on how to brush properly with it. All in all a great investment for good gums and clean teeth. Your dentist will notice the diffeence if you use it regualrly and properly I am certain of that!(Don\'t forget to floss and gargle too!)  8-26-10Just an added note...I have been using it now for two months! - I have had better check-ups, better breath and my gums \'feel\' stronger!  9-27-2010"

2179,1759,1818,20100601,B003983HRI,3,"June 1, 2010",AORCXT2CLTQFR,The Gillette Fusion line\'s latest incarnation.,"When the original (manual) Fusion shaving system was introduced in 2005, it was truly a major improvement over any and all previously available razors. It was (and still is) a truly revolutionary, advanced and innovative shaving system that made shaving virtually painless and hastle-free even for men with tough beards and/or sensitive skin. The ProGlide is the latest incarnation of the Fusion and it does offer some advantages over the original Fusion but not nearly enough to justify switching over (especially when considering that the replacement cartridges will be even more expensive than the manual Fusion\'s!). When I shaved my head with the ProGlide, I honestly noticed NO difference whatsoever (neither better nor worse) than when I shave with the manual Fusion. When shaving my face, I did notice that the ProGlide DID do a slightly better job than the manual Fusion at shaving tricky and hard-to-reach areas (especially the moustache area just below the nostrils and around my Adam\'s apple) but this is probably because the ProGlide\'s cartridges are supposedly 15% thinner than the Fusion\'s. I should also point out that the ProGlide\'s handle feels more sturdy and offers a (somewhat) tighter grip than the (manual or Power) Fusion\'s and that the design is more elegant but (of course) beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The Bottom Line: Fusion ProGlide offers some minor improvements over the manual Fusion but nowherenear enough to justify upgrading to an even more expensive product when an already excellent one is available.

For me, the soft rubber \'rumble strip\' that Gillette adds to these newer models just gets in the way and prevents me from getting as close a shave as I get with the good old Sensor. Another problem with the Gillette Fusion is the location of the pivot point between the handle and the cartridge; it\'s just plain awkward. That, coupled with the ribbed rubber strip, creates major shaving frustration. In any case, Gillette makes the best blades, at least for thick barbed wire beards like mine. Schick blades are garbage by comparison. They seem dull even when they\'re brand new, which leaves me a nicked-up, bloody mess. Gillette, I beg you, please don\'t stop making my tried-and-true Sensor blades!!!    "

The biggest problem with long curly hair, besides women telling me it isn\'t fair for a guy to have curls when they don\'t (only heard this about two million times over the last four decades), is that it can be an ordeal to get a comb through after a few days without washing, such as backcountry hiking, etc.Enter Pantene conditioners. I just started using them a few months ago, so this one for curly hair is right up my alley. I am normally one of those weirdos who uses as much organic stuff as possible, both food and other stuff such as shampoos, toothpaste, etc. I just don\'t like putting manmade chemicals on my body or in the environment. But this stuff is so efficient that I need only a tiny bit to do all my hair, less than half compared to the Nature\'s Gate Organics I normally use. Plus, it detangles the biggest mess of knots in seconds! I swear, it takes me ten minutes of careful slow work to get a comb through with almost every other conditioner when me locks is all dreaded up, but this stuff somehow detangles them in no time flat.It\'s almost a miracle! For that kind of performance and efficiency, I\'ll deal with a few chemical components, especially as it takes so little of this stuff to do the trick. I still use my organic stuff more than half the time, but switching it up with this Pantene is working great for those times when I\'m in a hurry, or my hair is so knotty that I\'ll pull out big clumps while trying to detangle it.In short: if you have long, curly hair that often tangles, I haven\'t found a better conditioner that will detangle hair quicker, and with less product needed, than this stuff. Plus, it\'s really pretty cheap at 5 clams for a big bottle, which will last you dozens of uses. Very fairly priced indeed.Zero complaints from me about this stuff.Highly recommended."

Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn\'t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough. The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin. This interference can also lead to nicks because it\'s difficult to gauge how much pressure to apply to get the razor to meet skin. The gel bars, the selling point of this product, are meant to be a substitute for soap or some other shaving gel. But if you tend to use soap anyway, they are superfluous.That said, this is a decent razor. Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.    "

It comes with an additional brush head, and there are five different brush heads which can be purchased.  They are described in the instructions, and there is a $3 coupon included inside the box.After approximately two and one-half minutes, the brush slows down and gives a couple of sluggish spurts, which signals time to stop brushing. It doesn\'t stop by itself and has to be turned off. It is compact and fits well in smaller hands.  I wasn\'t expecting too much from this little toothbrush but was very surprised at its vigorous action.  My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after use.

One AAA battery (included) goes into the handle.  Just press the blue button and you get a vibrating disposable razor.  Very cool, but it doesn\'t seem to make a difference.  For one, the marketing materials included in the package make no claim to any incremental benefit of using the vibrating razor function, only that it turns itself off after 7 minutes.  There are plenty of claims about the thinness of the blades, etc. but nothing about the power function.  In fact, it\'s distracting, and in some cases for me, interferes with the tactile nature of shaving.  Sometimes you need that feel when you\'re hunting for a few whiskers that escaped the first one or two passes.  You don\'t want to redo an area too many times, so you sense by feel where the patch is that needs extra attention.  This razor made me realize how tactile in nature blade shaving can be.As for the rest of the features, I\'m sure Gillette made some incremental improvements but I can\'t tell.  I do think the first shave out of the package was just marvelous.  If I were rich and spendthrift I would only use each blade once.    "

She says she likes the Oral-B.  I bought her some kids replacement heads (I found them on ebay for a really good price).

She watches the timer while I\'m brushing her teeth and I have never had a problem reaching the 2 minute brushing time.The toothbrush comes with a stand and a place to put four toothbrush heads which is nice.  I have two heads in there for me and one for my daughter.  Once I can convince my son to use the toothbrush, there will be space for his toothbrush head.

This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90% of the replacement blades, I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop (presumably glue) all over the blade, with the single blade missing! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems, as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet, and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality. I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke, but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades, I think it\'s time to call a spade a spade. I shave my head and my face both, and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors, and even with a fresh blade, many times it feels as though I\'m shaving my face/head with a sharp rock. needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase.

All you have to do is wet it and begin shaving since the soap-like pieces above and below the blades turn to a clear substance the consistency of (sorry!) mucous as you shave.  The handle is molded to fit comfortably in your hand, although the weight feels more like a disposable.This pack comes with two sealed blades -- airtight so as not to dry out the lubricant.  Herein lies the first problem:  instead of a neat row of blades in a small holder, you get individual pods.  For this reason, the packaging is bulky, and it seems like a very non-green approach to razor blades.I use a Gillette Quattro as my primary blade, so I compared the two.  I used the Venus Breeze without soap of any kind, and I used the Quattro with my usual Dove Body Wash.  The Quattro shaved slightly closer, although this wasn\'t obvious until the second day.  My skin was noticeably drier on the Venus Breeze leg, however.  The best news is that the lubricant worked since I had no razor burn or other discomfort while shaving.I recommend this razor primarily for travel when you don\'t want to take cream or gel for shaving and you can pop a pod into your bag.  Because the lubricant is solid, you don\'t need to put anything in the airport carry-on quart size bag, which frees up more room for other items.This razor works exactly as advertised, although I suspect it will end up because more expensive than most choice simply because of the cost of replacement blades.

I didn\'t know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too.  Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!).  I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I\'ve used in the past.  However, as other reviewers have noted, it\'s not as \'rich\' or full-bodied when it comes out of the can.  The \'instructions\' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams).  Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it\'s good foam, and I\'d give it a higher rating if it wasn\'t for the \'watery\' consistency when it comes out of the can.  This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).In summary:* If you like foam, you may like this one.  3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won\'t like it.

I used to use the Sonicare Elite 9500.3. I just opened the package yesterday evening and have used it twice so far.4. I needed a new brush because my old brush\'s battery died.*Brushing*Pros1. I am happy with the cleaning that I am getting.2. The brush feels like it is massaging my gums.*Charging*Pros1. This brush is dual voltage and will work both in 110v and 220v areas.2. This base of the brush seems much more stable than my  Sonicare since it is a little wider.*Traveling*Pros1. The brush does include a travel case.2. Since the travel case is plastic, it will be much easier to clean though compared to the cloth Sonicare case I had.Cons1. The travel case is MUCH larger than my old Sonicare.2. The travel case appears that it is more likely to break since the plastic hinge area seems like it can wear down.3. The brush heads do not have a plastic cap to help protect the bristles.  I liked that the Sonicare had this option since I was reassured that nothing dirty was touching the bristles while transporting it.*Operation*Cons1. I could not figure out how to get the brush to offer an audible cue when switching quadrants while connected to the SmartGuide.  It only offers an audible cue when the radio is turned off.*Cost*Pros1. This brush is much cheaper than the latest Sonicare.2. Replacement brush heads are much cheaper than the Sonicare (by about half the price).*Maintenance*Pros1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush heads appears that it will be much easier to clean unlike my Sonicare which always had a lot of buildup that was difficult to clean.Cons1. The part that plugs into the replacement brush head is a relatively small metal rod.  I am concerned that if I drop the toothbrush, this may bend and I would be unable to load any brush heads.2. On either side of the brush, there is a section with a silver coating.  Unfortunately, this stains easily with water stains.  I wish that Oral-B had used something that would help avoid the water stains.Overall, I am content with the brush. I wouldn\'t consider myself a Sonicare convert since this isn\'t perfect either, but I plan on keeping this brush."

Well, this tradition is about to change.After using this brush, my teeth have a smooth and polished feel all the way down to just below the gum line! Amazing! Even my manual brushes don\'t do as thorough a job. Also, the brush charges through induction which means that it\'s waterproof and has no wires or metal contact points that need to be protected from water. This is very cool.I could only find one minor downside to this brush which is that the head is somewhat thick. What I mean is that the distance between the bristle tips and back of the head makes it necessary for me to open my mouth fairly wide  to get the brush the tops of my rear molars. This isn\'t a challenge for me but it might be for someone with a smaller mouth.I guess I can summarize my review by saying that I\'m tossing out my manual brushes because this is now my personal favorite.

(With a $2 coupon, it would have still been a savings.)- You have to buy two instead of one- You might have to add in shipping costs when you compare!

After researching different nearby stores, Amazon was almost $20 cheaper in price!! I\'ve used the brush a few times already, and I really do feel like my teeth are smoother and cleaner than when using a manual toothbrush.  I am a hard brusher, so I appreciate having the \'too hard brushing\' warning on the handle, and I like how the vibration briefly changes every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch to a different section of your mouth. I am very pleased with this brush."

I have a much older model Oral-B and while it still works, this new Oral-B works MUCH MUCH better. My teeth feel cleaner and it gets more of the tartar off of my teeth than the older electric toothbrush did. I find that my teeth feel cleaner all through the day. I don\'t feel any plaque build-up as I did before. Also, the toothbrush handle is longer and easier to hold onto. I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush."

However, I really like the nice new handle design as well as being able to easier clean the hair trimmer.  I wouldn\'t pay more for this one compared to the regular Fusion, it\'s not worth it to me.  Really a good razor with no complaints.    "

When I asked my dentist, he said getting used to the vibration might take a bit of doing but otherwise he feels the cleaning is superior to brushing. I tried this one because the handle is slim, the charger is small & the reviews said the vibration wasn\'t quite as strong as the more expensive one.  Also, there are 2 settings. I tried it, I use it twice a day, & I like it very much!"

PERIOD.    "
