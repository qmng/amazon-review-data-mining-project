2717,2788,20111014,B003UKKHB4,5,"October 14, 2011",A2W712221XHE5M,Good value for a good cleaning,"I researched different \'middle of the road price-wise\' electronic toothbrushes, and I ended up choosing this toothbrush. After researching different nearby stores, Amazon was almost $20 cheaper in price!! I\'ve used the brush a few times already, and I really do feel like my teeth are smoother and cleaner than when using a manual toothbrush.  I am a hard brusher, so I appreciate having the \'too hard brushing\' warning on the handle, and I like how the vibration briefly changes every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch to a different section of your mouth. I am very pleased with this brush."

1051,1074,20090522,B000AUIFCA,1,"May 22, 2009",AOLESBOPF41LN,Awful design - lousy product!,"Please notice the little hole that exists near the top of the toothbrush head - on the neck of it.  This hole spits out your toothpaste/saliva mix anytime that you happen to maneuver the brush so that this part come out through your lips.  The result is a flow of toothpaste and saliva all over your brand new shirts - this sucks unless you like paying for unnecessary dry cleaning.  The alternative is to lean over the sink so that gravity will pull this flow down into the sink, not down on to yourself.  This is rather uncomfortable after about 2-3 minutes of standing in this awkward position.  The projectile saliva/toothpaste mix is an inevitability with this design - it sucks!  I hate this product and will never buy it again.  What a waste!  Supposedly the best on the market?  What a joke!"
1882,1927,20110704,B002HWS9FW,5,"July 4, 2011",A1AV5Y9AJF2GA7,Glad I bought this!,"I love the Oral B electric toothbrush line, my teeth get really clean.  I needed one that my brush-heads would fit on, but that didn\'t need to be plugged in to the wall.  When we moved to this house I didn\'t realize the outlet in the bathroom only worked when the light was on.  This means plugging in my toothbrush doesn\'t recharge the battery.  I tried keeping it in the bedroom, but that didn\'t work.  With this toothbrush I don\'t need to plug it in!It works great!!!  I haven\'t had to change the batteries yet and it\'s been weeks, now!Best of all, I\'m going on a vacation soon and I can take this with me and know my teeth are getting really clean even while I\'m traveling."

As a result, we have always reverted back to using manual toothbrushes. A few months ago she came home with an Oral-B Smartseries 5000 kit from our dentist.  She loved it, plus the kit had lots of extra brushes, free mouthwash, etc, etc. The rebates and offers brought the price down to about 1/2. A great deal. I was skeptical at first but after trying it for awhile I also was impressed. I ordered one and have been very pleased. So we now have one in each bathroom. This is the first toothbrush system we have been totally satisfied with."

1489,1523,20100119,B001CX4JSS,1,"January 19, 2010",A1KIPZNM2148DC,Would not turn off!,Worst toothbrush i have ever owned.  I owned a sonicare and decided to get something with less expensive brusheads.  the Oral B Pulsonic worked fine for about 2 months....Then it would not stay OFF.  I would turn it off.....and set it on the recharging base....then after about 2 minutes it would turn on by itself.  Really bizarre.  Worst craftsmenship ive seen in any toothbrush.  The brush would no longer turn off when coming in contact with the charging base.  So finally after an hour of letting it run i finally just took it apart....and all the wiring inside was corroded.  I do not think this was designed to keep water out.  Very poor product.  Save your money and buy any other toothbrush.  Huge buyers remorse....I am considering never buying ORAL B products again......
1517,1553,20090907,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 7, 2009",A226VGZWOEBPGL,High praises,"I have used both the Sonic Care and the Oral-B Spin Brushes but really liked the slimmed down design of the Oral-B Pulsonic. The sensitive feature is a real plus I found that my other electronic toothbrushes did not have.  Its easy to use and slim handle is more comfortable for me.  It otherwise has the same features as other electronic toothbrushes ie 2 minute notification, as well as 4 30 second interruptions to let you know to move around in your mouth. It will be more consumer preference on design that motivates the purchase. However I would buy this item again and suggest it to friends."
103,104,20111128,B00006ANDK,4,"November 28, 2011",A2GBK9NWPTUMXO,"Good for sensitive teeth, but almost a little too soft",I have extra sensitive teeth and suffer from genetic recession on my teeth so have to be careful about what brushes I use.  I like that these are soft but they are so soft that my teeth sometimes still feel like they are \'wearing sweaters\' even after I brush them.
2180,2230,20110207,B002HWS9GG,5,"February 7, 2011",A2QSW7G73JTHZ8,Hygenist clean,It feels like having your teeth cleaned at the dentist. I was not using the mode right so I went and read instructions again and every thing is great. The smiley face even winks when you go way over. I would recommend this to everyone. All of my married kids have now told me that they have an Oral B brush. Wish they had told me sooner as they really like theirs.
939,958,20110119,B000AUIFCA,5,"January 19, 2011",A3TALU0YA004ZF,Great replacement for standard brush heads...,"Just received these brush heads as replacements for the standard heads and I really like them. Took a couple of brushing to get used to the slightly different feel, (the flossing tips have a different depth and texture), but once I did I felt like my teeth felt slightly cleaner than with with standard heads. Overall, good purchase."

SMALL AND COMPACT COMPARED TO PHILLIPS YET I LIKE IT. THE PRODUCT SO FAR IS GREAT AND THE PRICE CERTAINLY WAS GREAT. THE ORG PRICE $66.00 TO $99.00 AND MY PRICE FROM AMAZON WAS $19.00. HOW MUCH BETTER THAN THAT CAN YOU GET. { AT THAT PRICE IT WOULD OF MADE GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFTS }

I THINK IT IS THE BEST I HAVE EVERY HAD.I have had expensive electric toothbrushes and other battery operated ones - the best out there - but this is so much better than any I have every owned.I had trouble getting the top off to put in the batteries.  It was on way too tightly - even my cleaning man - a strong man - had a bit of trouble.  I did NOT have enough pressure.  I always worry about damaging my thumbs because . . .I did damage my thumb joints (both) once trying to take off a cap of baby aspirin.  Go figure!The directions on the baby aspirin said it required two thumbs to lift on both sides and I really hurt my thumb joints on both hands - still not quite healed after almost a year.  I never successfully got the top off - someone else did it for me.  If our 4 year old granddaughter had been here, she  would have been able to take off the childproof cap for me.  That always seems to be so very funny to me!I am just telling this as I think sometimes you forget your buyers are not all young and as strong as a four year old.  SmilingBuy the toothbrush!  I am ordering more.  The BEST EVER!"

(comparison),"I\'m new to electric toothbrushes and I decided to try sonic actionbecause It seemed my first choice, Oral B Professional 1000,did not vibrate enough.  Well, I found out what sonic action is,even on the low setting, with very little noise, about a 2 on the 10 scale.I\'m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head) whatever off your teeth,but, if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?I decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional 1000.That\'s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes) cleans all surfaces very well,very quickly because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was over doing.However, the noise for it is about a 4."

MSRP when I got it was around $180. The sonicare is thinner, has better features, is better looking, and brushes better with less space in your mouth (if that makes sense.)All that being said, this toothbrush does about 90% of what the sonicare does at close to 1/6th the price. Nearly the same price as I paid for the sonicare heads the other day.It is a huge step up from manual and $10 grocery store electrics. It leaves my mouth feeling very clean. (Somehow not quite sonicare clean though) It seems like it will accumulate grunge/yellow in the future. Also I\'ve not noticed any of the heads around town, so I will probably have to order those online, which is ok, but I like availability. Also, and this is a small issue, if it knows to slow itself down after 2 minutes, why cant it turn itself off???I think if you want an electic toothbrush on a budget, this is the one to get."

These are just replacements, but this system really does a good job at keeping teeth clean and gums healthy.  I like the side of the toothbrush heads.  They are a lot like regular toothbrushes size-wise.  The small brush really cleans by the gums well."

My only criticism is that they are all the same colour - for families it would be useful for each person to have a different colour toothbrush head so they do not get mixed up.  The product is small enough to fit into a standard envelope, but I was sent mine in a cardboard box 30�23�11cm, which annoyed me a great deal.  Aside from the inconvenience associated with it not fitting into my mailbox, using such boxes is very wasteful.  Also, the P&P charge was about $5."

That is until I used this brush, after just one use my teeth felt as clean and smooth as I just had a cleaning. I am still using the basic tip that came with the brush so I can only imagine what the results would be after using a more aggressive tip. Well worth the money and I would highly recommend the investment."

The only problem is that the brush heads keep going up and up. The last time I purchased some they were $13.47 for the three pack, and I bought a bunch of them. If they go up anymore, we\'re going to have to find some another alternitive instead after we run out of brush heads. which will be very soon. Like going back to using a regular toothbrush instead of these or something else! It\'s just not worth paying over $6 a brush head anymore for them. They don\'t work that well! I would try and find something less expensive that works just as well or better no matter if it\'s a manual or electric toothbrush."

When I feel that I have to stop, I don\'t feel like that my mouth is clean enough.(I can feel the plaque still there with my tongue)I bought this powered toothbrush and now I find that I Can brush for the full 2 minutes Without any or very little pain! The head is small enough that I don\'t have to open very wide to clean and when I am done I have that Just-From-The-Dentist-Clean! My teeth even look whiter! So much that my friend even thought so too! I Am Very Pleased with my new toothbrush!I found my toothbrush for LIFE! I also LOVE the 5 modes that you can choose from!NOTE to some people: You will find in the directions booklet that if you are not used to a toothbrush like this, your gums may bleed just a little the first three (approximately) times until they get used to your new brush. It Does NOT Hurt and it does not last long. (about 1-2 times you spit while brushing then it stops.)ALSO note that you will also find in the directions that you have to charge it before you use it.

This toothbrush cleans as well as the old toothbrush but doesn\'t set off the buzzing, tickling sensation. It also sprays less toothpaste if I open my mouth while brushing or the bristle end comes out while I move the toothbrush around. Fewer toothpaste specks on my clothes make me a happy camper!"

This particular brush head is the best I have ever used for getting my teeth and gums really clean. It does take some getting used to. It is noisier than other brush heads and there is a lot going on in your mouth when you use it. You can actually feel the rubber tips going under your gums to remove plaque as you use it. I am amazed at how well it works!

I can feel the difference when I go back to my regular toothbrush! My teeth just don\'t feel as smooth as when I use the Oral-B. I share it with my boyfriend, and with their little brush extenshion caddy, it is a relatively easy process. Just make sure you clean it often, because the toothpaste residue dries on it often and makes it unpleasant to look at. But either way, great product! Gentle but effective. I also enjoy the orange light that tells me when I\'m pushing down too much on my teeth, as my dentist had previously told me I have a problem with that."

I had a 10+ year old Oral-B 3D toothbrush, and I thought it did a great job, but heads were expensive, and my teeth have that JUST CAME BACK FROM THE DENTIST/DENTAL HYGIENIST FEELING!  I highly recommend this product.  works great, small, fits the hand great, easy to use, and does not retain water or toothpaste in hidden crevices like the sonicare or oralb 3d heads do.

I had a few cavities and he recommended this one to me.  It works great.  I waited for my next appointment to write this review and I had no cavities and the dentist hardly had to clean my teeth.  It has a 2 minute timer and every 30 seconds it changes up the vibration so you know when to switch to a different area in your mouth.  It has two settings and one is softer for gums or when you\'re just starting out using it.  It\'s not a really loud one and it doesn\'t need any batteries, it has a recharger.  I\'m able to charge it up and take it on a long weekend and it works just fine.  It comes with a smaller brush for getting along your gums.  The only thing I wish is that it had a cover for taking it elsewhere, but that\'s it.  It\'s a great toothbrush and it definitely helped my teeth and the dentist saw the difference."

I ordered before from Amazon and never had this charge, it must be something new. So I won\'t use this site again.The item was pricy enough without this additional \'deposit\'.

1448,1480,20100925,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 25, 2010",A3TL64H6FMF4EM,Love it,"I am no expert on this type of tooth brush, but I can tell you my impression of the first of this kind I have ever used.  At first, I was shocked.  This thing vibrates (like a buzz) your head when brushing the top teeth.  It is kind of like a dentist drill but much more dynamic.  It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \'dentist office\' cleaning.  After one week I have already seen the difference.  The company advertises two weeks, but one will show results.  It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  The bristles are somewhat hard without the slightest irritation to the gums.  Since this device uses NiCad batteries, I do not keep the charger plugged.  It has gone 2 weeks without need for recharging.  That is amazing.The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  The \'timer\' feature is great and is very useful.  The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  The tiny brush (floss head) supplied with it is useless.  I wish they would have placed an extra tooth brush in it\'s place.  The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  It is hardly bigger than a manual tooth brush.I very much recommend this tooth brush.  There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.  I question whether the costs difference would be worth it."

It has a feature of three speeds which is very nice. when first turned on it is a regular speed, when the button is pressed again it goes to a slower speed designed for sensitive, when the button is pressed the third time it is a combination of regular and slow speed alternating radidly between the two.

The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.In particular, note that the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per second, and does not have a battery charging indicator. All of which are present just one level up in the Professional Care 1000.To me the lack of a quadrant timer is a big disappointment - I don\'t want to be watching a clock while brushing if I don\'t  have to. The gentle thrumming of the Professional Care 1000 every 30 seconds is a very nice pacer.The brushes in the Professional Care series not only add quadrant timers, but also are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second, and have battery charge indicators.As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.Overall, I found the Vitality to be lacking features that I rely on. Hence my rating. I\'d strongly recommend that you consider the Professional Care 1000 as the minimum entry level functionality for a brush. You\'ll probably find (like I did) that you don\'t need much more than what the Professional Care 1000 has to offer.Happy Brushing!~Damodar"

After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can\'t see because it\'s inside the column. It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next day.The directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable. I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000% markup.I tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.Caveat emptor."

After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.-----THE GIST OF IT---------I\'m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that\'s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn\'t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It\'s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn\'t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn\'t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It\'s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.-----ENDING------Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won\'t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won\'t do it.  They\'ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.Lastly, I don\'t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes."

423,431,20050817,B0000C4KJV,4,"August 17, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one\'s teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.2.  Waxed floss is \'waxed\' to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don\'t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: \'If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away\'.I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.Jim \'Konedog\' Koenig, DDS"

That\'s the way I felt after using this toothbrush.I\'ve tried plenty of motorized toothbrushes in the past, from expensive to the cheapies you can grab for six bucks at a supermarket, but I\'ve always returned to a standard manual brush. Not this time, though.The Vitality is really incredible. The included two-brush heads (and you get two of them) have an oscillating section at the top, and a section that goes back and forth beneath it. While one polishes and cleans one tooth, the other is getting between them, almost making floss redundant (I said almost). It even has a timer that goes off after two minutes, pulsating the motor a couple of times to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing.After charging it up for 16 hours (which they say will give you a week of twice-a-day brushing sessions), I followed the manufacturer\'s suggestions for how to use it (yes, I actually read them - all part of the review), and can honestly say no other home toothbrush has ever made my teeth feel so clean.Additional brush heads are available in various styles, though why I\'d ever want anything beyond the two brush style that came with it eludes me (they do make a polishing head though, which I suppose I can understand even if I\'m not personally interested). According to the instructions, each head should last about three months, and with refils costing about four bucks per head (in a package of six), that nets out to about 12 dollars a year for refils: a steal for how well this works.I\'m already buying another for my kids\' bathroom: because it comes with two heads they can each have one (downside: no color coding, so I\'ll use a sharpie to delineate them).A fantastic toothbrush that is at last worth ditching a standard manual brush for, I can recommend this without reservation."

It\'s also relatively portable, so good for travel too, though you\'ll need to bring the charger along for longer trips.The Pulsonic is not as gentle on your teeth and gums as most of the more expensive toothbrushes I\'ve owned, but I haven\'t had any problems with it. It just feels like the motor does not run quite as fast or as smoothly and I think that probably makes it a little less effective at getting your teeth completely clean. It is certainly a lot better than my old manual toothbrush though! Overall I think it works very well.I bought it about a month after my previous (2-3X the price) electric brush broke, so I\'d been using a manual brush for a bit. After a week of using the Pulsonic my teeth were noticeably whiter and have gotten whiter since then. I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past- my soda drinking youth eventually caught up with me I guess:(. I\'ve had this brush for a year and my dentist says my teeth and gums are in great shape.My only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn\'t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right? If you\'re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don\'t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic."

Overall, we are both very satisfied with this product.Product Details and background for my review--------------------------------------------I have owned Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  I have owned a previous generation of Oral-B electric brush some years ago and found the build quality was poor when compared to Sonicare. Sonicare employs a rapid vibration of the brush head to generate sonic waves which dislodge plaque from teeth.  The Oral-B brush has a small, round head that rotates back and forth (It does not do full rotations.  If I had to guess about how much it rotates before it switches directions, I would guess somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees).  The package says that in clinical studies it improves gum health better than Sonicare advance.  I cannot provide feedback on this as I have not been to the dentist since I have been using the Oral-B and even if I had been, the results of that visit would not be guaranteed to be related to the brush itself.THE GOOD--------This toothbrush is very well constructed.  This new model has excellent build quality throughout.My teeth feel smoother after using the Oral-B than after using my Sonicare.  I thought I was imagining it and didn\'t mention it to my wife but when she approached me telling me her teeth feel cleaner and smoother, I was convinced that the mechanical performance of the brush was better at cleaning the teeth.  So far the battery performance is very good but it is a new brush so I expect it to be so.  It has a pacing mode similar to Sonicare\'s in that it gives the user feedback every 30 seconds (the brush head stops moving momentarily.  Sonicare beeps in this case, but I don\'t think this is a plus or minus for either brush).  I did like that the Oral-B will let you go beyond the 2 minutes (30 seconds for each quadrant of the mouth).  The Sonicare makes you start it again as it shuts off after 2 minutes.  I brush my teeth for 2 minutes and then brush my tongue so I find the fact that the Oral-B continues to run after 2 minutes is a plus.  The brush heads are cheaper than Sonicare and they have different kinds (basic cleaning, floss action -- which has little rubber floss picks in the head).  This brush gives you feedback when you press too hard.  My Sonicare Elite does not do this.  Cleanup is \'slightly\' more difficult with the Oral-B but the way the head connects is better making overall cleanup much better.  The Sonicare has a deep plastic well that houses the magnets that cause the pulsing.  Liquids (water, saliva, toothpaste) can get in there and it is not easy to get it out fully, even with a Q-tip.  Over time, this can cause mildew, so I have had to use a q-tip in alcohol to solve this.  The way the Oral-B is designed, this would never happen, you just remove the head, rinse it and give the brush a quick wipe on a towel.  The design is very good and supports easy cleanup.  I hesitate to put the wireless remote brush monitor in the \'Good\' category, as I don\'t like it, but some people who are really gadget-heads might enjoy this.  Basically it is a small LCD display that shows you where you are in the brushing cycle and gives you a visual cue when you\'re brushing too hard.  The brush itself gives you this feedback though, so I think this wireless thing is kind of \'hokey\' and when the batteries die, I\'ll likely toss it in the box and throw it under the stairs.  The good thing about it is that both my wife\'s brush and mine connect to a single wireless display without \'pairing\'.  I haven\'t tried to use it at the exact same time as her, but this obviously would not work.  It has tiny integrated legs so that you can lay it down on its side without it rolling away.THE BAD-------There is a \'mode\' button that lets you cycle through the five brushing modes.  It is right where I naturally want to put my thumb so I have had to train myself to put my thumb elsewhere so I don\'t keep changing modes while I brush.  It is much louder than my Sonicare  The Sonicare works by a magnet turning on and off rapidly so there is no connection between the brush head and the \'motor\'... In the Oral-B, there is basically a tiny axle that connects the motor to the brush head.  This is inherently noisier than the Sonicare design.  I don\'t find it terrible though.  I do not find the wireless lcd display to be useful.  Everything it provides can (and is) provided by feedback in the toothbrush itself.  The wireless lcd display is just another thing to clutter your bathroom vanity.  With that said, the pricing does not make it feel as if I paid extra for the lcd display so I am not too concerned about it.THE UGLY--------Nothing about this toothbrush was terribleOther things to considerThe brush has various modes (high speed, lower speed, one that slowly goes from gentle to vigorous and back, one that pulses, etc.  I believe there are 5 such modes).  I do not use them because my gums and teeth are not sensitive so I use the vigorous mode full-time but maybe somebody with sensitive gums would want the pulsing mode so they could have some gum stimulation without over-doing it."

I bought direct, not through a 3rd party seller, and I received a fake product both for this head, and for the pro white as well. The fakes are also getting very hard to spot apparently, because none of the \'real vs fake\' pictures given on the product page were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct. You use it in a very sensitive area of your body, and it\'s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off is similar in quality."

Very affordable; it has  a 2 min time built in; a set of 2 AA alkaline batteries last close to 2 months without the loss of speed (some technology built-in do that), but make sure you grease  battery cap o-ring before you close or it will crack after some time (it happened  to me); it lasts  forever  and it does the  same  job as  the  much more expensive Oral-B in the market. Dito.I have posted the same review for the oral-b vitality toothbrush, but it is related to the pro-health model as well.I\'ve been brushing my teeth wih oral-b for over 10 years now, and they are all similar to  the vitality model.  I\'ve  always used the least expensive model since I see no difference from the expensive ones, unless you are looking for \'extras\', like timer, lcd screen, etc. The vitality is a very good brush. I use the round head instead of the elongated.  I rather brush my teeth with oral-b than any other eletric brush on the market. The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well. Oral-B  entry level eletric brushes are the way to  go. I can\'t brush my teeth with regular toothbrush anymore. Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but saty way from the  cheap kind. They are knock-offs  and last less  than a month. The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more. The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings. I think this is annoying. I didn\'t want to leave the brush recharging after every use. So I bought the ORAL-B Pro-Health that uses two AA batteries. It is simply AMAZING. The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better. The batteries lasts forever on the pro-health. I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months. It is the best.  The vitality rechargeable brush gets very slow after 3-4 days. Not with the pro-health. Buy the  pro-health. It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design. Another thing is ORAL-B equipment lasts forever. I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me. And since they are the entry level brushes, I just buy another one of  the same. No need to buy another battery.Again, go with the ORAL-B PRO-HEALTH eletric toothbrush."

My dentist (who just so happens to be my favorite medical professional) has been relentlessly hounding me to come over to the electric side.  Every six months she\'d ask,\'Didja gettit yet??\'  and I would sheepishly reply that I still couldn\'t fathom the $80+ toothbrush. Of course, upon examination of my rear molars she\'d wax philosophical about those who properly brush for the full two minutes, and follow the listerine-floss-brush system every single day.  Finally, I gave in.  Mostly because I lost my dental insuranc. I figured I should step up my home cleaning to make up for missing a routine cleaning or two.Now for the technical:The setup was completely intuitive.  It came with a multi-page english/spanish instruction booklet, which being human, I did not read.It has three modes of cleaning, I really only use the one.  Every 30 seconds it makes a little pulsation, which allows you to time how long you clean each toothy-hemisphere.  (30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right) This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.  Like lying on the couch with the dog and the boyfriend.  Comfortable, perfect.I swear my teeth are cleaner looking.  I don\'t swing with that whitening paste, it ruins your enamel. I think this brush makes the difference. My gums feel awesome and healthy.Seriously, what have I been doing all my life??"

Usually, I buy the regular, round Flexisoft brush heads. The last time I tried to purchase them, however, the store was out of stock. But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.They work well. They deliver that nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and expect from our Oral-B\'s. In this regard, they are at least the equivalent of the Flexisofts, and they may even be slightly superior.Braun embeds 4 little rubber \'paddles\' into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss. I can not detect any \'flossing\' from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess. It may be that the \'paddles\' do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell. They cause no discomfort. The brushing feels slightly different, but not unpleasant.The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers. Rather than being circular, like the regular heads, it is an oval. The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large. I think that one of the Oral-B\'s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth. That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.When I need to replace these, I will look for the regular Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. In my opinion, those are the best. But if I can\'t find them, I would not hesitate to buy these again.***UPDATE 2/2011: It amazes me, but there appears to be a *thriving* market in counterfeit Oral-B Brush Heads! I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon. Under the price, where it says \'Sold By\' make sure that it says \'Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\' If it doesn\'t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \'More Buying Choices,\' and see if you can find one that says Amazon. Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don\'t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon."

I brook down and bought the version with the SmartGuide. My thought was what the heck even though I thought I did not require it. I have say that there have been times when I would have stopped brushing before 2 minutes are up because I thought 2 minutes had gone by. Note that the toothbrush pulsates every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants and pulsates three times at the two minute mark, so you don\'t really need the SmartGuide. It is still nice to check while brushing and the clock is a nice feature as well. For Christmas I got my wife the same toothbrush, but it now seems to be called the 5000. I have to say it is hard to figure out all the models and sets Oral-B creates. I told my wife that when you first use the toothbrush you will feel as if your teeth are going to shake right out of your mouth and she agreed. After a couple of uses, you become totally use to the brush. I have read negative reviews in which people stated this toothbrush makes their gums bleed, I can only assume they have gum problems and brushing action was too much for their gums. Without a doubt my teeth are much cleaner with this brush. I am not always good about flossing, and I would notice that when I got around to flossing again after period of not flossing that my gums were sore the following day. I noticed tarter build up as well. With the Triumph/5000, I never notice these problems now. Of course this toothbrush is not a substitute for not flossing, but I feel it really helps if you don\'t always floss. Our kids have now used our toothbrushes as well for the last few months and most importantly they are brushing for a full two minutes. Prior to this my son was closer to bushing for 10 seconds than 2 minutes. I figured too that the newness of the brush would have worn off with them, but they still seem to like it. Battery life is good as well. I get about 11 days between charges, but I also brush between 2.5 minutes and 3 minutes every time I brush. With that factored in I would say a 2 minute brusher would get pretty close to 2 weeks on a charge. Bottom line is this is a great product. So much so that I hauled it with me on an 8-day trip to Europe, and it went in my backpack not my checked luggage. I still take a manual toothbrush on overnight trips, but I sure hate not having this toothbrush with me."

But lately, I\'ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \'bristles\' and how they\'d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I\'d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I\'ll be certain to purchase this model again.  Goodbye, Reach!"

After about 2 weeks, the battery display started to develop moisture within the display. At around one month, the display could no longer be seen since condensation had turned into large water globules that obstructed the display.With 4 uses per day by two adults, after 3.5 months, the toothbrush failed to turn on but would activate after a few minutes or sometime in the day by itself. It is apparent that the board has gone bad and the toothbrush is no longer useable reliably.Pros:This toothbrush has a holding stand that can hold up to four individual heads for multiple users, or different toothbrush heads. (Be sure to dry your toothbrush head before placing in case, or you will have a gradual soap scum build up)Multiple Settings for persons with sensitive teeth.Timer that displays vibrations by 30 second intervals for dentistry recommended minimum of 30 seconds per quadrant.Timer also displays time. (Would like to have had the timer lit since the angle is almost at 90 degrees and should be angled slightly higher by about 15 degrees more for adult use.)Cons:The price is high for what seems to be only a timer radio frequency linked display and a few lower setting for strength of brushDid not last long for something that is exposed to soap in mouth and running water when rinsedPower connection is very l;arge and takes up a lot of spaceaway from the electrical socket. (MOst people are limited to counter space in the bathroom)In conclusion, I liked the design and feel of the toothbrush but was very dissapointed that it broke on me after only a few months. A little red light displays on the timer to show if you are being to rough on your tooth enamel when brushing, which I liked but also wanted the motor to be as powerful as previous models. Maybe this was bad for my teeth, but I could feel the difference on the gum lining of each tooth when touching sliding my tongue for cleanliness.since some people have a hard time returning things, maybe this one should be bought in a store with a guaranty instead of online. I will try to contact Oral B and Amazon about a replacement, and will update this review upon their response with difficulty or ease."

The brush heads will set you back, but you can find them on sale as well as cheaper generic versions.

Despite the name change from \'Triumph\' to \'SmartSeries,\' there are no differences except for the charger-toothbrush-holding-stand, which has changed from a tall rounded design (which was a pain to assemble and disassemble) to a elongated flattened rectangle.  In fact, if you look at the handle of your SmartSeries 5000, it says, \'Triumph.\'  All of these toothbrushes are the same design, except the 9400 doesn\'t interface with the SmartSeries clock.I have noticed that the price point has stayed similar over the years, and now Oral-B is consistently including the \'SmartGuide,\' which is a little clock-like contraption that gives signals (e.g., time, time of brush, too much pressure, etc.).  This toothbrush is convenient and does a pretty good job of keeping your teeth much cleaner and whiter than manual brushing.  My dentist doesn\'t scold me as much during cleanings any more.One caveat: My husband\'s Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries) had a bearing go out within six months of normal use.  The SmartSeries clock would flash the \'red triangle\' (brushing with too much pressure) caution and the toothbrush would buzz uncomfortably throughout the brushing process.  Although the toothbrush originally cost us around $149, we couldn\'t find the original sales receipt in order to claim the warranty.  Finally, after complaining about it for a year-and-a-half, we accepted the hit to the pocketbook and replaced his malfunctioning Triumph 9900 with the SmartSeries 5000... which was surprisingly the same toothbrush despite the name change.In short:- The price at MSRP is the equivalent of 30 regular toothbrushes, but it does a very good job when it works- This toothbrush is a good buy from Amazon due to significant price decrease (major retailers are still selling it at MSRP)- The SmartSeries 5000 (with SmartSeries) is the same as the Triumph 9900 (with SmartSeries)- Keep your receipt for potential warranty issues! Better to be safe than sorry, and $160 poorer due to replacement cost (like us)- 10 hours to fully charge, about 10 days of charge at 2x brushings/day- Standalone charger is convenient to detach from brush-holder for extra counter room or to take on trips"

Too Pricey for What it Does, Though","I have SLE and sjogren\'s (another autoimmune disease that has pretty much destroyed my salivary glands).  I do not have enough spit in my mouth, which leaves my gums fragile and my teeth prone to cavities - even in the front.  My dentist is great and is working with me to save my teeth and gums, but I have to stay on top of things.I have been using a sonicare for a couple of years.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The sonic waves sort of pummel out the junk between my teeth and loosen it up even places that the toothbrush cannot physically go.  However, that brush brutalizes my gums and the sonic action sprays stuff everywhere - my sink and mirror look like a crime scene after I brush.  The Oral-b 3000 cleans physically only - no sonic stuff, so it only gets the stuff the bristles can get to.  That amounts to teeth that are slightly less clean in spots than what I get from the other brush.  However, my gums barely bleed at all when I use this on the sensitive setting.If your main concern is gum disease, and you\'re a good flosser, I would recommend this over the sonicare, because you\'ll be able to massage your gumline without damaging good tissue.  Press the start button twice for the sensitive setting, and you\'re good to go.I deducted one star for the price point.  I think a brush this expensive ought to include sonic technology.  Sonicare has the essence for $40 less than today\'s price for the oral-b 3000,  but if you need a decent brush that will not hurt your gums, this is probably worth the added expense.  I give it an 8.5.  It cleans better than the lower-priced oral-b products - almost as well as the sonicare.  The sensitive setting is a really nice feature for people like me with fragile gums. And replacement heads are affordable - much less expensive than the sonicare."

Years ago my dentist recommended Sonicare and I have been a faithful user of them, upgrading when new models came along.  My dental visits have reflected that use.My hygienist prefers Oral-B and we have talked about it over the years.  I wasn\'t persuaded.  Recently Oral-B started a 50% off campaign and with their 60 day return policy I thought I would try them out.I am glad I did.  I very much like this toothbrush and how it works.  It is bigger than my Sonicare Flex, but even so it feels very good in my hand.  I love the smart timer.  While the Sonicare gives you a beep/jar every 30 seconds, you can see your progress with the Oral-B on the timer.  The Oral-B also gives you a jar too.  In fact, this is the one thing I don\'t like about it.  It is too much of a jar, especially at the 2 minute mark.  It is as if your car is about to stall.After two minutes the Sonicare shuts off.  The Oral-B keeps going until you shut it off.  I am finding that I keep on using it for another 30 to 60 seconds.  Now you can select a deep clean cycle of 3 minutes rather than the normal 2 minute cycle, but I find I prefer going through the normal cycle and then concentrating on the areas my dentist has mentioned as needing extra attention for another 30/60 seconds.The brushes seem to be fine.  I have used the ones that came with the package but also the sensitive head.  I like the sensitive head best.

While I have been blessed with a cavity free mouth, I still hate enduring the scrape of the dentist\'s tools against my teeth. And I know it\'s just a matter of time until the dentist breaks out his drill...It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  You can probably chalk it up to \'user error\'....  I wasn\'t brushing properly, nor long enough to really keep a clean mouth.I did a bunch of research on electric toothbrushes to see what the fuss was about. Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  hmmm...  more research led me to this model - the motorized head rotates in the recommended pattern and the handle buzzes/vibrates in 30 or 45 second intervals to help you judge the brushing time of each section of your mouth.  Recommended time is 30 seconds per quadrant.  But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn\'t enough for me.  What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up) the amount of time you have been brushing.  If you look at the picture of the box, you can see the digital display, it\'s a little bit bigger than a business card, and about an inch thick.  As you are brushing, the display will track the quadrant you are brushing, and when your brush handle buzzes, the digital display will move to the next quadrant - giving you a visual que to move on to the next section of your mouth. It will even tell you if you\'re brushing too hard! When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds... the smiley face will wink at you!  :  It\'s a flirty toothbrush!My husband and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  We absolutely love them.  We recieved them two days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.  I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn\'t a big deal. I never have to wonder if I\'m brushing properly or if I\'m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \'fresh from the dentist\' clean mouth.  The handle holds its\' charge for a long time, I can brush for 2 1/2 minutes twice a day, for 9 days before having to recharge - however, I usually keep the brush handle in the charger when it\'s not in use.I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  The travel case is a hard, sturdy plastic to protect the brush handle, and the detachable brush.  It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly. My toothbrush will never again travel in a ziploc baggie.  :) Yay!I did have a little bit of sticker shock when I purchased two of these at the same time, and then again when I saw the cost of replacement brush heads.  But I feel like I am taking good care of my teeth, and I know my next dentist appointment will be less stressful.  Also - I know P&G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time. This makes me feel like I\'ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  Plus P&G offers coupons on their website all the time, so I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.This model isn\'t just an electric toothbrush - It\'s quality control for your mouth!  I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  Happy Brushing."

If you\'re a sonicare user, switching over to this brand will blow your mind away. It cleans your teeth fantastically, and it really leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean like no other toothbrush in the world. The first time you use the product, you will definitely feel the difference in your mouth, because it will feel much cleaner. It gently massages your gun as well, thus improving gum health. Gum health is directly related to cardiac health by the way, so it is very important to have healthy gums.

1561,1599,20090114,B001CX4JSS,2,"January 14, 2009",A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,Good Product Except for the Fatal Flaw,"I was encouraged when I received this toothbrush.  Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife\'s mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a \'clean\' mode and a \'sensitive\' mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars."

These clean your teeth so much better than a normal toothbrush and the size of the brush head is perfect. The brush heads might be a little large for some people, but they fit my mouth perfectly."

The size of the brush head doesn\'t bother me, though it is a little messier to use.  It\'s hard to keep your mouth closed enough to keep all that drool inside.

Now you might suggest that I prefer it because I\'ve got a big mouth, but that\'s not the case (surprised?). I find smaller toothbrushes take too long to get the job done, even allowing 2-3 minutes per brushing.The Oral B 60 brushes are hard to find in stores (and I do look), so a 6 pack lasts me a while. The brushes aren\'t too soft or hard, and my dentist thinks my old teeth aren\'t in all that bad condition, and seem to be reasonably well cleaned. I even give away the toothbrush he hands out at each visit and use the Oral B 60 instead."

She\'s quite happy with it, and was pleased to discover that the batteries and head were both replaceable. As for my own experience with it, I prefer the Sonicare-style brush head; this one has a particularly thicker post, which combined with the odd channels in it seem to make for a fair amount of drooling while I brush. Not exactly a big deal, but certainly not what I\'d like to use for everyday brushing. Still, it\'s an excellent value for the price."

I have taken it on trips up to 5 days and the charge holds fine without recharging.My only criticism is that sometimes when I am holding the handle I will accidently press the button that switches to the next brushing mode.  So I have to make sure I hold the handle low enough.  The handle may be made for a man\'s larger hand whereas with my hand I would like to hold it a little closer to the brush, but that is when I can hit the button.I would definitely buy this again."

In the early 80s I had gum surgery because of it. I\'m supposed to go to the dentist every four months for a cleaning, but of course I don\'t go to the dentist near that often; maybe once a year if I\'m lucky. Anyway I always have a large plaque buildup when I finally do go to the dentist for a cleaning. The last several times I\'ve gone to the University of Pittsburgh school of dentistry where dental hygiene students do the work and the instructors check their work and correct the cleaning if necessary. Anyway I\'ve never had better cleanings in my life, but I still get severe plaque between cleanings. The last time I went the instructor recommended the Oral B 5000 toothbrush for my plaque problem. I thought I\'d give it a try and to say I\'m pleased is an understatement. I\'ve been using it now for five weeks after my last cleaning and as of yet I can feel no plaque buildup on my teeth. In the past by this time after a cleaning the plaque was starting to form when I used a regular toothbrush. I use the included timer and clean my teeth for a total of about 2 1/2 minutes. The feature I like is that you can get the molars clean. This was always a problem area for me in the past. Also the toothbrush will slowdown or stop if you press too hard. After a week or so you know what kind of pressure to apply and hone your cleaning technique. I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has a plaque or gum problem. One final note; I don\'t keep the charger plugged in all the time. I charge the toothbrush and can use it for eight or nine days before recharging. I\'m old school on this and feel the battery will last much longer if not charging all the time. I might be wrong on this, but I know at the very least it won\'t hurt battery life."

I wanted to see if a less expensive electric toothbrush, if it was comparable to the more expensive electric toothrushes, like the one I have been using for years now, and have been very satisfied with.This electric toothbrush doesn\'t have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive electric toothbrush, such as the ability to choose from more than one setting, or a UV sanitizer.I have to say tho that this electric toothbrush made my teeth feel like they were really being scrubbed, so when I was finished using it, my teeth felt very clean.  This electric toothbrush came with 2 brush heads, which seem alittle bigger than the more tapered ones Iam used to using, and this motor seemed to be alittle louder. It actually would slow down, then rev back up.  The automatic timer on this electric toothbrush is supposed to run for 2 minutes, but mine seemed to run for much longer than that, so I went with it.My other electric toothbrush runs for 3 minutes at the setting I use, so I didn\'t mind this.  You always have the option of just turning it off when you want to.I wish this electric toothbrush came with some kind of cover for the toothbrush heads, and some kind of travel case, but for the excellent price of this electric toothrush I can\'t complain.  It does come with a rechargeable stand, which I just leave my electric toothbrush always plugged in, and on the rechargeable stand.  That way it is always ready to use when I need it.I also like that in reading the information that came with this electric toothbrush, that you have like 5 different options for brush heads, depending on the kind you like.  The brush heads seem to be alittle more reasonably priced too, as I always like to buy a minimum of 3 brush heads at a time.  With this electric toothbrush you can even buy them in a quantity of 6, if you want to.  I like to have enough for a year, which they recommend you change your brush head every 3 months, which I agree, so I do that.If you\'ve always wondered if you would like using an electric toothbrush, but didn\'t want to spend the big bucks, you should try this electric toothbrush.  It works very well, at a reasonable price.The major reason to use an electric toothbrush to begin with is to really clean your teeth and gums, which this one seems to do that as well as my more expensive electric toothbrush.Having healthy teeth and gums is so important to your overall health.  Everyone should be able to afford to have an electric toothbrush. I know some of the electric toothbrushes are cost prohibitive, at over $100, but this Oral B electric toothbrush is under $30, much more doable for alot of people.I will continue to use this electric toothbrush, along with the other electric toothbrush I already have.Iam very happy that I was able to try this product, and very satisfied with the results I got."

We really, really  like the smaller brush head which seems to  be able to clean teeth in  places that a longer, straight brush does not.  Our  older  straight brush seemed to coast  along the front while this brush gets into crevices.  Neither of us is sure that we\'ve ever had a problem because of brushing too hard.  Nonetheless, the warning light for that is a nice safety factor.  High on our  list of positives are the brush head indicator  bristles that let us  know when to change the brush head.  That\'s one thing that we\'ve been unsure of and procrastinated about in the past.  Sorry to say that our teeth don\'t appear to be any whiter so we continue to use the Crest strips."

Since the dentist reported some \'sensitive\' areas to watch, that had not been brushed as thoroughly, I decided to take the plunge and invest in this toothbrush. The toothbrush comes with a charger and clock/timer for each of your cleaning sessions. This not only monitors how long you are cleaning, but, has a little red light that is illuminated when you are brushing too hard. What\'s more, once you have reached the two minute mark, a smiley face appears on the digital timer. So helpful! I look forward to following up with my dentist in six months, to track my progress. Once you have been brushing with this toothbrush, diligently, for three weeks, plaque is supposed to diminish.

My last model was sold as a two pack from a membership-based big box store. Those lasted my family about 2 years before the batteries started to loose their ability to hold a charge. I purchased this when it was a featured \'gold box deal\' and do not regret it one bit. Although it comes with a higher price, the performance is remarkable. I fell as if I am leaving the dentist office after each time I brush my teeth. The timer is more of a novalty than anything, but I do like the visual feed back to know when I\'m applying too much pressure while brushing, etc. Having a clock in the bathroom is also a nice bonus.

Caught sight of the price and thought if they\'re the same, why not?My opionion: THEY ARE NOT THE SAME! The packaging looks legit, and before you use one for the first time, product seems legit. After a few uses, kapoot! Head gets wobbly, then loose, then gone.I agree with a prior reviewer that the likelyhood of someone going to all the trouble of setting up a production line to produce fake knock-offs, at this price point, would be very low. I believe, as others, that Braun simply started using an alternate source for production without paying attention to quality.Braun, if you\'re paying attention: Address this issue soon, as you will be losing a number of die-hard customers!Amazon, if you\'re paying attention: Consider contacting your sellers about these obviously inferior products.

It\'s like I\'m Rambo but not a psychopath and with the cleanest teeth EVER. But wait, there\'s more. The other day I was driving down the street and I got pulled over by a cop for speeding. He got out of his car, came up to my window, and asked me for my license and registration. As I gave it to him, I looked up and flashed him one of those Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) clean smiles. It just so happened that he was a user too. He instantly realized, gave me a nod and a wink, and ripped up my ticket. Thanks, Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision. The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure. Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums. I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.

It feels like you just left the dwentist after a very thorough cleaning each time you use it.If I could offer one suggestion it sould be that they should inform the purchaser in a much more prominant way that when you plug the charger in and put the unit in the base there is no indication it\'s getting any charge. I was about to return the unit thinking it was defective when, to my amazement, the charging indication finally came on AFTER the unit had been in the charging cradle for about 10 minutes. I would imagine that many folks will plug it in, put the unit in the charger, see no indication of charging and promptly return the unit as \'defective.\' it\'s not. That\'s how long it takes when you charge it for the first time to \'connect\' with the charger.

The outer bristles are raised about two millimeters above the middle ones- meaning that you have to gnash them into your gums just to make contact between the middle bristles and your teeth. Then there\'s the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush. It\'s like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face. There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience."

The strength of the brushing on \'normal\' mode is certainly not gentle, but then again, that\'s what the \'sensitive\' mode is for. We always use the normal mode and we\'ve had no issues. The \'Floss Action\' heads seem to work quite well to remove some of the inter-dental debris, but flossing is still necessary.We were a little skeptical about the SmartGuide, but since buying this toothbrush was part of our plan to improve dental hygiene, we decided to give it a shot. We mounted it on the bathroom wall next to the mirror. The thing quickly detects when you start brushing and shows you a diagram and a timer, so you know how long you need to brush.
