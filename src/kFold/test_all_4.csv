Read if you want to find the new product that is the same ingredients as the old product formula!Pantene is trying to say this Shine Enhance conditioner is like the Old Restorative Time Renewal. IT IS NOT. If you are looking for the old formula then you need to buy the Pantene Pro-V Restore Beautiful Lengths FRIZZ CONTROL CONDITIONER. I had the tube from the old formula and found the ingredients in that and the ingredients in the Frizz Control Conditioner ARE THE SAME. I tried to email and call Pantene but they obviously don\'t know their own products and continue to give inaccurate information.AS FOR THE OLD FORMULA SHAMPOO:If you want the Old formula Restorative Time Renewal Shampoo then you will want to buy the NEW BEAUTIFUL LENGTHS SHINE ENHANCE SHAMPOO.I am trying to help because many of my family members and I used the old formula and were worried when they changed things. I have compared the ingredients and no matter what Pantene customer service tells you....these products I listed are the actual replacements. Try them you will see.OLD REVEIW:One of the best conditioners you will ever use for damaged hair. I am a professional stylist and have not found any line that works like Pantene Restoratives Time Renewal. Pantene has stopped making many of their products. What a shame. They said consumers were confused by all the choices. Call and complain. Their products were superior and did what they claimed. IF IT AIN\'T BROKE DON\'T FIX IT!

Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren\'t secured in their package.  Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  And since you\'ve already bought the item, there is no need for overly attractive packaging either.  The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can\'t re-use the packaging from the store).As far as longevity, I\'m probably about as tough of a test case as you can imagine.  I\'ve got thick, stubborn hairs on my next that lay sideways and reverse direction in certain spots.  Every time I shave these razors get a good workout.  When a razor is too worn, it is a painful experience and leads to immense amounts of irritation.  Needless to say, I notice pretty quickly when these get dull, and the razors from Gillette through Amazon take just as long to dull as do the razors from Gillette through the grocery store...this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.  This is the exact same product.  And, if you will still be shaving in a few months, do yourself a favor an subscribe for additional savings.    "

She specifically recommended the Oral B electric toothbrush.  After doing some research I quickly learned that the Oral B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 was the top of the line.  I recently purchased this product and have seen a noticeable improvement in my dental checkups.  I would definitely recommend this product.

I had an old Mach 3 razor, it was good but I needed a new razor.The design of this razor is amazing. The wieght of the Fusion is pretty similar to the Mach 3, unless you have the battery powered one, then I guess it would be heavier. I thought, \'5 blades? Are you kidding me...when will it end?\' But I swear to you this razor cuts better than any 3 blade razor I\'ve ever used. I also thought that the small razor on the back of the Fusion was pointless, but I was wrong. The small razor is great for side burns and getting small places like under your lip and under your nose.I only nicked myself once, but WOW this is a great razor. I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion.    "

That\'s how I feel about this product.I wonder if the extra blades even do anything useful during my shave.  But the real question here is whether the \'power\' part of this product differentiates it at all from the non-\'power\' version.  Really, what\'s the difference?  I couldn\'t tell any during my shave.But...  Compared to the Schick multi-blade razors, the Fusion is incredibly better.  The wire that holds in the Schick blades makes for not as close a shave.  The Fusion\'s extra single blade is a great innovation, something they should consider for their single-blade model.Still, this all leaves me wondering if I shouldn\'t just get my own straight razor and avoid this monthly razor tax.

What\'s different?  5 blades!I\'ve used most of the Venus products, thinking (erroneously) that I was leaving less plastic in a landfill by buying a razor with replaceable blades.  The first Venus promised \'the legs of a Goddess\'.  That one had 2 blades.  Somewhere along the line, they\'ve gone to 3, and now 5 blades.  There was even one that took a battery and vibrated a little bit!  But I digress.Out of the box:  a razor, an extra blade package, a suction cup mount for the shower wall.They were truthful, this razor will give you a close smooth shave.  The pivoting head keeps you from cutting yourself, and yes, this works well.  The \'moisture strip\' ensures a smooth glide up your leg.  Its quick, feels nice in your hand, and I got smooth, goddess-like legs without a lot of effort, and without having to stem any bleeding.  5 stars for shaving efficacy.I like the moisture strip because it allows the razor to glide smoothly up your leg without \'skipping\' or scraping.  It seems silly and maybe even gimmicky, but compared to a razor without one, the moisture strip is amazingly helpful.The little plastic gadget is meant to suction cup to the shower wall.  It opens like a little door to reveal a spare blade set.  Nice idea, but it wouldn\'t stick to my shower.  And when it falls off it blows itself to smithereens.  Earlier versions had double stick tape, and the suction cup idea is far preferable, if only it worked.Compared to disposable razors, this is far superior.  It works better, and you don\'t cut yourself.  Compared to other Venus razors, not much difference.  I like them all!  I\'m not convinced that 5 blades are necessary (unless you are a yeti) but all things being equal why not?All in all, highly recommended, watch for a sale.    "

I am fairly sure this is damaging to gums and teeth. I immediately ordered the sensitive heads and am very happy with my toothbrush. These should not be sold.Let me refer you to what is currently the top-rated review for this product.

Toothbrush on her counter as a recommended item and that it had the same woodchuck action floss head as this one. When I told her I was glad to see that she endorsed the floss action she nearly had a stroke.She didn\'t realize that was the head that was on her demo unit and told her assistant to change it.

1890,1470,1520,20111217,B001G7PMV8,5,"December 17, 2011",A375QUNTNORBG5,Gillette Custom Plus Razor are the absolute best for me,"For me, the Gillette Custom Plus Razor is the absolute best and closest shaving razor on the market.  I have tried, bought, or sampled just about everything out there except a straight razor.  I even have a very expensive safety razor \'kit\' I purchased from an internet supplier of shaving supplies.  The most expensive razor felt like I was using a Samurai sword on my face and it simply did not work as well as these Gillette Custom Plus pivoting razors did.  Again, maybe they just work well for \'my face\', i\'m not sure, but these work well for me.  Very comfortable, reasonably priced (about $1.30 a razor), and the longest use I get from a razor before I have to throw them away.  I would dare say (from my experience) that these razors use the exact same \'head\' or \'cartridge\' on them as the Gillette \'Sensor 3\' Razors which also work very well for me.  I always seem to come back to either the Custom Plus or Sensor 3 (both by Gillette) and again I think they use the exact same cartridge on top (triple blade) but they have a different shaped handle.  Thats the only difference between them.  I usually get about 7 to 10 days of shaving with these.  Other disposables give me 3 to 5 days before becoming very dull and unusable for my face.  Make sure you flush the blades out with water and let the razor dry after use for the best result and longest days of use.  Another trick with these (or any razor for that matter) is a high quality shave cream.  I\'m not talking about these \'foams\' or crap like that.  You know what i\'m talking about.  Get yourself a good quality shave cream in a jar and a badger hair brush to apply it with.  I know, some people may think i\'m crazy or something, but trust me on this one.  The badger hair brush (GOOD QUALITY ONE!) may cost you about $35 or up.... in price.  It will last a LONG TIME (years) if you take care of it and shake it out and dry it each day.  A good quality shave cream (such as something from Crabtree & Evelyn or Sephora, or ULTA will set you back between $20 to $30 a jar, tube, or tub but you use very little each day by applying it with the Badger hair brush you purchase and it will last forever trust me.  When I say it will provide you with a super close shave, I mean closer than using a cheap foam or gel.  I was about 40 years old when I finally broke down and bought a good quality Badger brush (after seeing reviews about them on-line) and I was so happy I did it I will never go back to those junk foams or gels that cost $2 at Walmart or similar locations.  You wouldn\'t think it would make that much of a difference, but trust me, IT DOES!!!!!  It just simply makes a difference, period.  Coupled with the Gillette Custom Plus razors and a good quality shave cream and Badger Hair brush, you\'ll have a great shave that is very close, even if you have a coarse beard like mine.  Happy shaving my friends!    "

Then we can charge twice as much for replacement blades.Marketing Guy #2: Perfect.  Any consumer would think that 5 blades is far superior to 3.  Let\'s make the thing vibrate too.. that\'ll really blow their minds.Marketing Guy #1: This also buys us some time for when we decide to release the 8 blade razor.  Helloooo promotion!This thing is a gimmick.  It works just as well at any 3-blade razor I\'ve tried.  In fact, packing 5 blades into such a small space requires you to constantly rinse the razor, making for even longer shaving sessions.  Depending on your skin, you will be more susceptible to razor burn with this razor as well.Overall, this thing doesn\'t do anything better than a 3-blade razor.  So, unless you have a burning desire to try the latest razor and a massive amount of money for replacement blades, stick with your current razor.    "

I will tell you why:1) The fusion has such a big head that there are some places that it simply can not go, I know that it has the blade on the back for those hard to reach places but that is only one blade - the Mach 3\'s head is much smaller and can get the whole head in those hard places.2)  Cost - why pay more gilette seems to think we want to pay more.3) Wilkerson Corp said it best when the company said \'the simple addition of one blade does not necessarily make for a better shave.\'  Only if things in life were that simple.Had Gilette not sent me the free Mach 3 I would have probably never known about it and stayed with the more expensive model.

In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.This Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more toothpaste.What I do like:>>  The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all.  Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  Trust me on this.>>  The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.>>  I love the rubber grip handle.  My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.>>  Will go over a week between charges.  I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging.>>  Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.What I do NOT like:>>  No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.>>  The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I\'ve ever encountered.  My knife gouged into the rubber hand grip and I nearly cut myself twice.  If you have the option of choosing this with frustration-free packaging, get that one instead.I hate visiting my dentist. Since I\'ve been using these Oral B brushes, my exams are so good my dentist is pleased with me, but he\'s not making the money off me that he once did.The following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:1.

Not to put too fine a point on it but if a razor doesn\'t julienne my skin during the process of removing hair, I\'m satisfied.I was was somewhat stupefied when I opened the package and discovered that the handle had no loaded cartridge--the analogy that occurred to me was Carolyn Jones as Morticia Addams snipping off the heads of flowers. This, if it wasn\'t an oversight, struck me as kind of cheesy. I used the razor on my legs and underarms, without lather, and it did a good job and allowed me to retain my epidermis. I really don\'t know how long the lubricating action will last but I\'m sure it will continue to perform just as well with lather (I should add that my body hair is sparse and fine and doesn\'t dull a blade very fast).Speaking of cheesy, the oh-so-classy, \'sure you can spare it?\' holder-on-a-suction cup that\'s useless on a bathroom wall with very small tiles would have better been left on the drawing board. Other than that, the Gillette Venus Proskin Moisturerich (a lot of syllables for such a small item) performs as advertised, at least on my kind of hair. One then has to determine if the cost of refills vs. buying disposable razors is worth it.    "

I\'ve been using Mach-3 blades for a some time with mediocre results -- maybe because I haven\'t been shaving every day -- so I wanted to switch to something better and cheaper.  Atra blades are much less expensive than most other blades (e.g., Fusion), but it just doesn\'t work for me... and I think I may know why: my shaving technique sucks.The angle of the blade when shaving is very important.  The pivot point of the Atra is in the middle of the blade, which acts like a seesaw fulcrum: if you have the right pressure but a slightly wrong angle, the Atra will pivot to a more correct angle and shave well; if you have the wrong pressure but a good angle, it may result in irritation; and if both your pressure and angle are bad (like me), then it may result in irritation with nicks and cuts (and razor burn).Unlike the Atra, the pivot point of the Mach-3 is at the bottom of the blade: if the angle is wrong, then the Mach-3 will pivot to a better angle; if the pressure is a little too strong, the Mach-3\'s pivot will also correct for that; and if both the pressure and the angle are bad, then the Mach-3 may result in a good shave regardless of how much your shaving technique sucks.More blades may mean more irritation for people with sensitive skin, so Mach-3 is the highest I want to go.  If there is a (cheaper) two-blade razor with a bottom pivot, then I will try it.  I noticed similar irritation when I used the Sensor two-blade razor, and I think that the reason was due to the pivot point and my poor technique.  I really wanted to keep using the Atra because the price is much better, but it just didn\'t work for me.  If I ever learn good technique then I will start using a double-edge safety razor, but until then... it\'s Mach-3 for me.    "

I mean, really, if you\'re a man and you\'re reading this, you probably already own/use Gillette products.  It\'s a given.  They really are the best.  They are also really the MOST EXPENSIVE.I used the regular Gillette Fusion for years now - and just made the \'leap\' to get the Fusion Power.  Why now?  I mean the blades are ridiculously expensive as it is, what\'s another buck or two on top of that?!Tried it for the first time today.  It works well.  The vibrating is a bit weird - it\'s like a hand massage while you shave.  Shaving doesn\'t feel like shaving.  That vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with.  It certainly is painless to use.  It worked well - my skin is smooth.  No telling if it\'s smoother than the regular Fusion.  How could you tell?  I don\'t know if it\'s a gimmick or what - but I did like it.  I\'ll continue to use it, since I bought the darn thing and have no choice.~ EDIT 4/23/2010:  I now hate this thing.  Here\'s why: Within one or two shaves, the \'lubricating strip\' is completely gone.  After that first shave with a nice new blade, it hurts like hell to shave with.  It\'s as if the vibrating effect speeds up the wear and tear on the blades!  It\'s horrible.  It truly is.  On the weekends, after a couple days growth, shaving with this thing is horrendous - I\'ve never had a more painful shave.  The vibrating thing is just a gimmick: aside from that first shave with a new blade, it\'s not nearly as good as the other non-vibrating shaving razors out there.  I find areas all the time that it just did a horrible job on - rough spots.  I can\'t use it on my upper lip - because the vibrating makes my lips chap!  Even turned off, shaving HURTS with this thing!  I\'m throwing it out.  I had this old spare new Schtick razor I keep around and shaved with that a few days ago - WOW.  It\'s awesome!  So smoooooth.  The vibrating thing is a total sham, folks.    "

Maybe that\'s where the advances end since I could not tell a difference in shaving between this razor and the Schick Quattro and M3Power razor.  I don\'t feel like it gets a closer shave.  In fact, I don\'t notice any advantages in this razor at all.If you have never used a \'Power\' razor before, try it.  The vibrating that is put off by the batteries is very slight but definitely makes for a closer shave. Battery life is long, and one advantage this razor has is a low battery life indicator. That\'s about it though. The trimmer that was hyped so much is pretty much useless.  I am not a very hairy guy, but I tried it on my sideburns and it didn\'t do anything. Maybe I wasn\'t using it correctly but I couldn\'t tell what it was supposed to do.  As for under the nose, it was worthless there too.The major disadvantage of this razor are the blades.  You\'re going to pay an average of $3 per blade! Considering a blade lasts two weeks at most (which is how often you should replace them, regardless of whether they still work), prepare yourself for a $60 a year razor budget.  The M3Power blades are only $2 a blade, and backwards compatible with previous razors.If money is no object and you don\'t already have an M3Power, this isn\'t a bad razor, but it\'s not nearly worth the hype and price when compared to its predecessor.

After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.    "

So I\'ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea. It\'s now just a question of which one to get.In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh. We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it\'s doing a great job. It\'s not \'too mild\'. Our dentist praises us on how well our teeth are cared for. I don\'t see the need for the extra agitation this unit gives.There are no LEDs anywhere that we can see to indicate this unit is charging. It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn\'t being wasted.There\'s similarly no battery indicator.Finally, with the Sonicare, you get a blink every 30 seconds to change mouth quadrants. That way at the end of 2 minutes you know you\'ve handled each quadrant evenly. With this one, you solely get a buzz at the end of 2 minutes to tell you you\'re done. So you have to manage your time yourself.

No more bunching up in your underwear. No more wishing I was a bigger girl so that I could enjoy the freedom of tampons. The only thing that would make them better for me is if the had a wingless version, (I\'ve never really needed wings on my pads,) and a smaller, light flow day version. They are slightly longer (and wider in the rear) than the average pad but for me that is an improvement as I have felt that many pads available were too short, meaning I had to be careful how I sat/reclined when using one. Girls with heavy flows may still find these inadequate but as a moderate flow girl I find these to be better than the regular maxi pad. Did I mention They\'re so much more comfortable?

It really has cut the time...It is scary cause it feels like the blades are sticking to your skin, yet the whole shave is surpisingly smooth.  I was able to shave under my nose and under my lips, and not a single cut, or even the sense that I\'d be cut.It really made short work of my face... Which I personally only shave once or twice a week.  So my hair does grow over the week.Surpisingly not once did I have to actually Clean the blades, or try really hard to get the gunk out.  Everything just seemed to clean just fine under the water.However this is the reason I am giving it a 4 stars rather then a 5 stars (but seriously is there such a thing as the perfect razor in the first place?).

The next day when itchiness tends to rear its ugly head, I didn\'t feel any dryness or irritation from either side.  So the Venus works on my hyper sensitive skin.  I was surprised, after two weeks of hanging in the shower on its included hook, be it as high up and away from water drops and steam I could get it, it didn\'t show any telltale signs of rusting, which I have gotten with other Venus line razors.  It has made me take out razors from the shower and dry them then put them in a bedroom door to give them the longest life. Not this one.  I could use this for a long time, well, until the soap wears off, without the blades getting dull or rusting.  I did, however cut the edge of  my ankle with the razor, it is sharp, caution should be taken with it.  It\'s pretty powerful for what it is though I do have fine blonde leg hair.

The pod has suction cups that allows it to be placed in the shower - without taking up precious space for my other necessary beauty products.

I prefer the oral-b / braun non-sonic over the sonic models. I am a big fan of this style of toothbrush & have owned them for almost two decades. I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years) and this one is my favorite. The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \'brake light\' which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums. Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \'get all up in there\', but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful. I buy the \'extra sensitive\' heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I\'m not \'paying attention\'. Even though the other models had an \'indicator\' (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn\'t really enough to get my attention so I didn\'t reduce the pressure.When I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light - it\'s *really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall. (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom). But, the \'brake light\' was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and the light now only goes on every once in a while.They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing. This toothbrush with its \'brake light\' feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums & your teeth, and in turn, your health & well-being!PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, & healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon). I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)"

This new formula is much gentler. It has a gel-like consistency, which won\'t weigh hair down or make it oily as a creamy formula would. This shampoo made my hair very, very clean. So clean, in fact, that I could probably drop back to shampooing it every other day instead of every day as I normally would. I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick.As for volumizing properties, my hair didn\'t go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it\'s making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer.The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day. So if you are going to try this shampoo, you should definitely purchase the matching conditioner to keep the tangles at bay.Overall, I\'d say I am satisfied with this shampoo. It offers great cleansing, a mild floral scent, and modest volumizing properties. For those who say that it is too expensive, you can easily buy an off brand version of this at just about any grocery or superstore for about two and a half dollars a bottle. "

Although I thought the five blades were a gimmick and put off trying it, I really do like it better than the previous Excel razors.  The \'precision\' blade on the top rear side is much more convenient than I would have expected, allowing me to get a good line on my side burns.  The blades last over a month for me, and I shave every other day on average (full beard growth, just sensitive skin).  When the Proglide Power razor went on sale for less than a new Fusion cartridge would cost me, I decided to give it a try.  Yeah, that was a no brainer.  :)  I liked the shave, and I decided to stick with it for another eight cartridges when this package went on sale.In my opinion, these aren\'t a big advance over the Fusion Power.  In fact, it doesn\'t seem much if any different to me.  The Fusion Power worked very well, and so does this.  These give a clean shave with minimal effort, even when I recently went five or six days without shaving over vacation.I was disappointed when the bottom glide strip on my first Proglide cartridge came loose.  I have never had a problem with a Fusion Power cartridge.  The two Proglide cartridges since then have held up nicely, though, so I think/hope it was an anomaly.So, I recommend giving these a try if you\'re unhappy with your current razor.  I do think that the Fusion Power are just as good, and they can probably be found for less money because they are the previous model, so you might want to try those first.    "

Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option. So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested. The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power. That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you\'ve ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your  shaver), you\'ll come to appreciate that gillette\'s blades can last a very long time. The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful. I\'d like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can\'t without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution. That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.Gillette probably hates customers like me. I use a cartridge for up to 6 months without replacement. Partly because I don\'t shave everyday (when you have a beard, skip a day and it\'s not really obvious). I\'m still on the first cartridge so I can\'t tell how dull it\'s become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it\'s 4 months now).

This includes a huge number of razor types, hair removal gels, buffers, sanders, yankers, radio signal needles, and much more.I admit that when the first more-than-two razor blades came out, that my boyfriend and I thought of them as a silly gimmick. The only reason we tried one is that a friend of ours worked at Gillette and I wanted to give her some feedback on how they worked. We thought it would be a wash. We were quite surprised that it did actually provide a better shave.In a way, it makes sense. The whole reason to have multiple blades is that hair is not all orderly and in a line. The first blade might cut off some of the hairs, but some will just bend beneath it. That bending then creates tension for the second blade to be able to cut it.If you only needed two blades, then you could do a single pass with a two bladed razor and have it completely clear all hair in its path. Of course, that doesn\'t work - at least not for me! When I then tested out a three blade razor, it definitely cut more hair on the first pass. Also, because you now have more \'cutting power\', you don\'t need to press as hard.So does this logic move on to give blades? Again, I was a little skeptical. First, the ergonomics of this razor are just GREAT. I\'ve tried many, many types of razors over the years. They can be very slippery in the shower. This one has a super combination of shape and texture. It fits nicely in the hand, and stays there securely.I also really like the wall attachment that this tucks into. The attachment holds spare blades as well. It stays securely on our shower wall and is easy to put the razor in and out of.So how well does it work? I\'ve tried it with a variety of soaps and gels. It slides smoothly and with the five blades it cuts thick hair with just one draw, without much effort. The without much effort part is really key. It means you get far less cuts, because you are not pressing down into skin bumps or goosebumps. You don\'t get razor burn because the blades are not dragging hard along your skin, slicing off the top layer.I haven\'t had any problems using it on any part of me. Underarms, legs, ankles, you name it. I would most definitely rather have the five blades with its gentle cutting power vs a smaller version. Heck, smaller razors with two blades *do* exist. There\'s a reason I use this one instead. It simply works better.Highly recommended.    "

Heavy and extra heavy pads were never absorbent enough. The similar sized (i.e. extra thick) pads would not stay fitted properly and caused leaks. The thicker pads I tried also twisted around to adhesive side up which was both very uncomfortable and caused them to not absorb correctly, so was also messy. I am concerned about toxic shock syndrome so I do not use tampons. I tried every brand of \'overnight\' or \'extra heavy\' pads out there at the time and none of them were up to it. I found these about three years ago and have not tried another heavy flow overnight pad since.With these Always brand Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings I never have to use more than one at a time. I\'ve never had leaks when using these pads and I don\'t have problems with them twisting around to adhesive side up. If you have extremely heavy menstrual flow then you should try these pads.It is true that they are extremely long and very thick. The pad length is such that some cuts of underwear will be too small (or short) in the back if you place the pad correctly. This causes the pad to overhang or stick out of the back of the underwear. This is remedied easily, but can be inconvenient. If this is something that you cannot stand then you should not get these pads.Regarding price, currently Amazon is offering a two pack for about 12 dollars. I\'ve seen big differences in price depending on where you get them (between 12 -20 for one pack)this is the lowest price I have seen so far (about 6 dollars for one pack)."

This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing. That was not enjoyable!

(The number on the Citibank pre-paid debit card website that is given for customer support simply has a message that says your direct deposit will be processed on a certain date.)  That made it seem more likely that something illegal was afoot.It took several days and several emails to both companies to figure out why this card (which says nothing about Oral-B) was sent."

The Fusion  has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days\' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade.

I\'d been considering trying out an electric toothbrush for a couple years now, after issues with gingivitis. However, the expense of a unit deterred me from purchasing one. The Oral-b 3000 is a sturdy unit, easy to use, and in a word of a novice user, quite a bizarre experience.To move from manually brushing your teeth to an electric brush requires a period of adjustment. The unit is very easy to use, and comes with features that make decisions about brushing teeth easier. For example, the unit recommends brushing each side of the mouth for thirty seconds; thirty seconds for upper left, thirty seconds for lower left. The unit actually pulsates at you when its time to switch, so little thought is required.Another feature I appreciate is that if you apply too much pressure to the brush, the unit will let you know by slowing down. It\'s a feature designed to protect the tooth from hard waring action. I do appreciate that.The bizarreness of the experience is the actual brushing. The sensation of whirring against my teeth immediately transported myself to my dentist\'s chair (never a pleasant time, in my opinion). Perhaps it was the sound as well. The sensation of a pulsating unit in my mouth brought up images of drills, and cavities; not all together pleasant.One drawback is already mentioned in another review. When the unit\'s rechargable batteries die, so do the unit. I\'m not sure how long they will last, but I would have to ask myself, would I spend money on another electric toothbrush when this one dies? At this point I cannot say for sure. I need to give the unit time to see if it is effective, and I\'ll know more from my dental hygeinist after my next dental appointment."

I saw a package of Always Overnight Extra Heavy Flow Maxi pads at my local Wal-Mart, and I thought it wouldn\'t hurt to try them out. W-o-w. First of all, this is a VERY long pad. It is about the length of two Always Ultra-Thin Overnight pads stuck together, and it pretty much expands from the top of my underwear to the back of them. Another helpful feature is that this pad contains two sets of wings--one in the middle like traditional pads and another set at the back. While, these pads DEFINITELY prevent leaks, I have a few complaints about this product. First of all, I\'ve noticed that when you remove the pad, it leaves a thin adhesive strip on your underwear that is hard to remove. So, though these pads keep you from having accidents, I still do not recommend that you wear your good underwear while using them.  Also, it is pretty hard to descreetly carry these in your purse, as they are VERY large. But other than that, I feel that they are an amazing product. Surprisingly, these pads don\'t feel like a diaper when I am wearing them, so that is a plus. However, I feel that women who are any smaller than a size twelve or fourteen might find them to be quite bulky, so I would take that into consideration. Also, if you are a woman who is already sticking two maximum coverage pads together just to feel comfortable, this maxi pad has about the same effect, so it will not be anything new to you.

My teeth feel clean!,"I have been using a sonic toothbrush for quite some time, so switching to the Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush was a bit of a shock. Once I got over feeling like I was brushing my teeth with a swirling brillo pad (a sonic toothbrush head doesn\'t rotate, it just kinda vibrates). I discovered what I have been missing! I brush too hard. There is a light on the back of the toothbrush (so you can see it in a mirror) that comes on when you apply too much pressure. The next thing I discovered was how clean my teeth felt! The Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing plaque between teeth (better than a sonic brush). My mouth is cleaner, my breath fresher, my teeth brighter and I have a happier smile since I switched to Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush!"

The strictly bristle models tend to wear out quicker and they pretty much all floss and brush the same.  The \'polishing heads\' are much different as they have silicone or rubber center which really does polish the teeth while removing plaque and flossing as well. This center also extends the life of the bristles by protecting the pressure/ breaking down during agressive brushing.  I smoke cigars, and after 2 weeks, the plaque is gone.  Feels like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist...squeek and all.These tend to be the most expensive heads available, but with better results and the much longer life, these are a no-brainer.

With this product, you get extra power; but you have to sacrifice some comfort and convenience to seal the bargain.First, let\'s get the obvious part out of the way: this stuff does a fine job of keeping you dry. In that regard it works as well as any antiperspirant I\'ve tried. Like other \'clinical strength\' products, the directions tell you to apply before bed at night, and explain how the product works by plugging up your pores so the sweat can\'t get out. I can\'t say that sounds too healthy to me, but after using a whole package, I didn\'t get a rash of any kind.Now, the sacrifices: in general, your underarm areas are going to feel weird. They\'ll feel tacky or rubbery to the touch, as though they\'re coated in dried rubber cement, especially for the first few hours after you\'ve applied the product. This might not bother everybody, but I didn\'t like the sensation.Finally, the elaborate packaging has a fatal flaw. You turn a little knob three clicks at a time to meter out the right dosage. The knob gives  satisfying loud click, and the packaging is strong and opaque. There\'s no squeezing or fooling around. But one day, you\'ll turn it one or two clicks and it will simply stop: the product will be all gone, but there will have been no warning. There\'s  just no way to tell when you\'re about to run out; this could leave you in an awkward position on the day of that big presentation...    "

I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.    "

Also, the 5000 has a separate timer that displays the time and the quadrant for brushing.  Actually, this is pretty helpful... two minutes, and I\'m done.

Vibrations, they are soooo soothing, i think i would recommend a buy not without it, it doubles the gliding pleasure. Dont buy the manual one (my very personal opinion, you can if you want :-) )4.

The Gillette multiblade systems are very forgiving of rushed shaving, and truly do a pretty good job.  That said, I\'d need to be able to shave in a tenth of a second to justify $3.50 or more per cartridge.  Seriously, Gillette?For times when you have a little more time to shave, I\'d recommend a good old-fashioned safety razor.  With a little more time for shaving, and a little attention to technique, you can get shaves with an old safety razor that are as good or better than anything you can do with a Gillette Fusion.Besides having razor blades that cost a tenth as much as the Fusion cartridges, a classic styled Merkur safety razor is a solid, well-made tool.  Much more satisfying to use than anything made of plastic.  And a puck of good quality shaving soap might cost $10 or less, and it will last you an entire year.  To top it all off, safety razors are more environmentally sound than the plasticky Gillettes.  No pressurized metal cans of goo, and the double-edged blades are inexpensive to manufacture and to purchase.More tips:  Proraso shave cream in the green metal tube is the best.  Gillette 7 o\'clock sharp edge double edge blades (made in Russia) are great and inexpensive - $34 for  100 at the time of this review.  I\'ve been using a Merkur model 180 for five years now, and love it.    "

Finding a great toothbrush can be a chore with the seemingly infinite options. When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions. Let me say I will be sticking with this one. The bristles are firm and \'aggressive\', albeit a gentle aggressive if that makes sense, while soft making it less likely to brush away enamel and/or gums. This was key for me. Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line. The back of the head of the brush serves as a tongue cleaner. It is really a scraper, so it\'s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn\'t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it. I highly recommend this brush!"

At the same time, it seemed like something with five blades would definitely cut closer and get most of the hair without having to go over multiple times and irritate my skin.  The question is, does it really hug to your curves and get all of your hair in one shave and leave skin smooth?  Yes, it does do a pretty decen job of doing these things, but I didn\'t feel it is a whole lot better than my three blad vibrance blades, except that it shaves just a little bit closer, which is nice.  So, overall, if you have sensitive skin, this might be a good razor for you.  If you like to just shave over an area once and expect to get all of the hair, this is about as close as you will get to that.  God Bless ~Amy    "

Got this one from Amazon after seeing the tv commercial. I couldn\'t be happier. It\'s small, lightweight, easy to use and trims very well. I was worried that the single AA battery wouldn\'t last long but it\'s still going strong after several weeks of use. It easily fits in my medicine cabinet and doesn\'t need a recharger cord which would dictate that it stay on the counter.Overall I\'d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, inexpensive trimmer.

I thought it was okay, until I tried this one. This is a fabulous brush.Pros:1. Rechargeable battery. Not likely to lose juice any time soon-just make sure you charge it for 12 hours before use.2. Small handle. It\'s not much bigger around than a regular toothbrush, especially when compared to the monster I\'ve been using. The charger is compact, too, and doesn\'t take up much room on my counter.3. Compact head. Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.4. Soft bristles.5. Vibrates rather than spinning. The spinning kind really chewed up my gums. This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations. Went away as soon as the brush was off.6. Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth. I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore. I don\'t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.7. Stops briefly to let you know when it\'s time to switch \'quadrants.\' (You\'re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.) When the maximum 2 minutes has elapsed, the brush gives a double signal.8. There is a precision attachment to get between teeth and into dental work.9. Does a fantastic job. My teeth are very clean.Cons:A bit louder than I expected, but certainly better than the SpinBrush, and the vibrating tickled my jaw. Hardly worth mentioning, though.I am incredibly pleased with this product. I would definitely buy this again and will recommend it to all my family members."

I do have senstive skin, and years back when I shaved, I basically did it incorrectly and from there I got the unpleasant razor bumps. Simply because I wanted to save money by decreasing my trips to the barber shop and I wanted to shave my head (bald) and face, I purchased this Gillette Fusion Manual Razor, as well as other products like Bump Patrol and some traditional Gillette shaving cream. To make a long explanation short, this razor is tremendous, and it gets the job done in every way. When it comes to shaving my head completely bald and shaving my face (and under my chin), it delivers a very close shave and the results speak for themselves. Shaving every night has become a routine procedure now (thanks to advice from a close friend and Bump Patrol) and I\'m fully satisfied with this Gillette Fusion Razor. Highly recommended!!!!!    "

The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they didn\'t even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs.

The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the form, and feel of the toothbrush.  If you simply cannot, or do not want to spend the money on the sonicare then I might buy this toothbrush.  I contacted oral b to ask if they offer a money back guarantee, which sonicare does. Oral b said they did not offer the guarantee on this model, but only on a couple of other models.  FIGURES!  The lady was polite, but I told her I was upset that I wasted my money on their product, and I will not be buying from them in the future.

I suspect that over time friction wears away at the internal parts leading to looseness.I was not happy about the experience and sent the defective brush to Procter & Gamble for evaluation. I was quite surprised when they replied that no manufacturing defect was present, despite being informed of the loose lower brush.

Honestly that\'s kind of frighteningly fast. BUT!The toothbrush is incredibly inexpensive and works better than my previous rechargable Spinbrush. The brush is much smaller, however, the bristles penetrate farther and the actual movement of the brush wipes away the grime on my teeth like a charm.

I really can tell the difference in my teeth\'s cleanliness and shine after only three days. I especially notice the difference on the biting surfaces, which seem smoother somehow. I also notice that when I floss after using this product, there is less \'stuff\' pulled out by the floss. I take that discovery to mean that this brush really does get in between teeth to remove food that normal brushes miss.A couple of other interesting features.1 - after 2 minutes, the brush noticeably pulses to alert you that you have passed the first brushing milestone - the minimum recommended brushing time. After 2 additional minutes, it pulses you again to let you know you should stop, having reached the recommended maximum brushing time. My wife, an exceptionally conscientious brusher, was amazed at how long 2 minutes really is. She had been under brushing for a long time.2 - The recharger acts as a stand for the unit, but you do not need to keep it plugged in to an outlet. A full charge lasts at least a week or more.3 - The unit seems well engineered, is easy to hold and the brush heads that come with the unit seem to fit \'just right\' in the mouth.4 - The first time I used it, the vibration was a bit surprising. It took my 2 or 3 uses until the novelty wore off, though brushing my tongue results is still a work in process. By the way, for those worried about sensitivity to vibration, I have mildly sensitive teeth, and the vibration has caused absolutely NO discomfort to any of my teeth.5 - Some people mention in their reviews that the brush was harsh on the gums the first time that they used it. I agree that the brush is a bit stiff the first time you use it, but after 1-2 uses, they seemed to soften a bit and now the brush seems to be very gentle on my gums.My only problem with this unit is that my wife and I are going to fight over it when I travel on business...Actually, there are a couple of short comings, but these should be easy to address. First, both of the brushing heads (which are detachable) are identical. A color band or some other distinguishing mark would be helpful to people sharing the device. Also, there is no battery indicator. I found out this morning that the battery was dying, when in the period of 30 seconds, the brush went from what seemed like full power to no power at all. Recharging it for 5 minutes allowed me to finish, but that\'s not an acceptable design choice. Perhaps a small red LED or an audible chime alerting users to a low battery will make it in to future designs."

But I discovered I could get just as quick a shave with some body lotion, and a regular razor.  In either case, the razor cannot be gripped too firmly because your leg IS going to hurt with a dry shave.  The lotion comes out of this razor on the second leg, and never in any quantity to be any help.For a quick shave, try some body lotion and a regular razor, but only if you have a little hair, and remember to lightly press.UPDATE:  It seems to work fine as long as you keep the razor totally satured with warm water and make sure you use a light touch.  I also put lotion on my leg before shaving because of the bad stinging that happened once after shaving.Works for a quick shave if you\'re not looking for perfection.    "

I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that\'s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference! I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads. They feel softer on my gums and so I think they are a gentler choice. I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth. I have been using these heads for almost 10 years and often get compliments at the dentist. Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums. Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best. I\'m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn\'t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth & gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.I do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect. I\'ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months. I find that the blue begins to fade after one month. I think I\'m an average brusher (twice or more daily) and I even have two toothbrushes I switch between (depending on which is charged & what bathroom I\'m in), so I would think that the indicator would last longer.This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE! Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (& recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual. (If you\'re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve. They sell plates, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, razors, etc. & I do really like their razors) I know that plastic recycling isn\'t the best thing for the environment, but it\'s gotta be better than throwing all these heads in the trash/dump/ocean... I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they\'re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.) But, I can only keep so many. Anyway, that\'s why I give this product 4 stars, instead of 5. Gentle, but wish they were recycled & recyclable.Many thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)"

The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  If I only had the choice between this and a manual toothbrush I would choose the manual brush.  I\'m sure it does an okay job and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  I also suggest considering sonic brushes that do not have rotating parts, I think after you get used to them they leave your mouth feeling cleaner."

It seems much harder to shave with and pulls at my face more. This is coming from someone who loves the mach 3 in its various forms. I\'m not sure what the problem is. Maybe the blades are too close to each other or something. Maybe trying to cut so many hairs at once is a bad idea. All I know for sure is it\'s not smooth.  It\'s not just a slight difference either. I go back to the mach 3 which I still have and I immediately notice the difference. Maybe others with different beards will have better luck but for me this razor down right sucks. I\'ve given it a fair shake too. I\'m still trying to use up the blades I stupidly bought.  However I can\'t ignore the fact it is far worse.Edit: I want to add one more thing. Whey you first put a new cartage in the razor does a pretty good job. If you tested it for one shave you might think it was good. However it really degrades very quickly. The second day it\'s noticeably worse and it just goes down hill fast after that. Again I am comparing this to a Mach 3 which I can keep for a much (and I mean MUCH) longer time and have it shave pretty good.  There is definitely some technical problem with this razor and I think a lot of people posting good results have a) tested it once b) are shills for Gillette c)  are in denial after spending a lot of cash on it or d) have a beard like a baby\'s butt.

I felt several times like I had razor burn, and actually skipped shaving under my arms one day because of the irritation.  I actually tried to give this the benefit of the doubt, and used it for several weeks, using several extra blades...I was just not impressed.  The shave was too close, resulting in bumps and an uncomfortable burn on my legs and underarms, not too mention the bikini area.  I want a smooth shave, but I don\'t want razor burn.I did, however, really like the grip and feel of the handle of the razor, and loved the handy dandy shower caddy, with the suction cups, and little cubby for extra blades.

Even the softest toilet paper doesn\'t compare to how gently this cleans and refreshes.

Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient.The tub isn\'t too tacky looking and fits the wipes perfectly. It also keeps them from drying out. Once in awhile I\'ll accidentally pull out two wipes from the plastic sleeve, which is like facial tissue nearly impossible to get back in and never worth the effort. I\'ll lay the wipe on top of the pack and it will still be moist the next time I open the tub to use it."

I shave a lot of stuff- legs, arms, armpits, bikini area, and my big toe. I can get away with shaving some areas once a week, but my legs need to be shaved at least every other day during the summer or there is visable black stubble. I have very sensitive skin that often gets razor burn and ingrown hairs. So I got this thinking, perfect! Three blades= close shave; built in shave gel= more convenient and faster.Well, there are several issues with this razor. During the first use, I noticed two things: One, there is a lot of slobbery goop coming off the razor... and two, the shave gel bars that sit above and below the blades make it very difficult to get a close shave. They do flex a little, but especially when they are new, they are cumbersome and they block the blades from getting close enough to the skin, especially in contoured areas like the knee and the bikini area. It does moisturize well, though, and at least for the first use or two, you won\'t need to use any shaving cream. I didn\'t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn\'t able to shave.By the third use, those gel bars have worn down a little (or a lot) and you can get a closer shave. But now with less slobbery gel goop, you are very likely to have irritated skin or little cuts. I have to use soap to lubricate my skin before shaving if the cartridge is not brand new, and I keep cutting my armpit with this razor and I didn\'t seem to have that problem with the regular Venus razor.The gel is either gone or falls off by about the fifth or sixth use. These cartridges are just way too expensive to have to replace them so often. I found that leaving the razor in the shower cuts it\'s life even shorter so I keep it in a cupboard when I\'m not using it... so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn\'t serve much purpose. Maybe if you are the only one who uses your shower and you shave every time you\'re in there you can get some use out of it.I like using this on my legs during the summer when I shave every day and I don\'t want to spend the extra time with shaving cream. I don\'t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble. I wouldn\'t buy this again- the regular Venus is easier to maneuver and shaves closer. Even if I have to buy shaving cream again.    "

I finally switched to a manual razor.PG\'s Gilette sent me both the Fusion and the Mach 3 free, so I tried them both.  I think P&G\'s Gilette is trying to confuse me.  I like the Mach 3 better than the fusion becasue:1) smaller head makes it easier to get into those small places, true the fusion does have the one rear blade for this prupose but the head was so large that I was not able to get the blade into those hard places.  The Mach 3 was able to get the whole head into most of the small places which certainly beats getting just the one blade in there.2) While the Fusion\'s handle was well balanced so was the Mach 3\'s handle and the Mach 3 had better gripping surface then the Fusion did.3) Lower price on the Mach 3, IMHO, means that the Mach does not need to beat the Fusion just get close to it.  In my test the Mach 3 did better than the Fusion.In terms of the question that I posed in my title, as with everything else in life which is better for you depends on what type of beard you have.  Do you have a heavy beard and have to shave multiple times a day(like Tip O\'Niel) or are you a teen, then the Fusion is probably the best thing for you.  Do you have a moderate beard?  The the Mach 3 is probably more what you need.  Or if you have a light one that does not grow very fast, like mine, then the Sensor or the Sensor Excell is more of what you need.  I think that I am going to go for the Mach 3.I stuck with the electric razors for years thinking that the manual razors would nick and irritate my face.  The may have been true thirty years ago but not now.  Electric razors don\'t give you anywhere near as close a shave as a manual does.As for shaving gell goes, save your dollars and buy the Barbasoll brand.

I saw the item locally so I purchased it with the intention of shaving with it first thing in the morning.  I am currently a Mach 3 user and I love it so I wondered if this Fusion thing would make a big difference.  I honestly feel that the shave with the Fusion is of the same closeness at the Mach 3.  However the Fusion has a HUGE bonus the extra blade (six) on the back of the shaving headto hit those stray hairs that remain under the nose that the Mach 3 normally misses.  Also it is much easier to trim sideburns with the Fusion because you do not have to worry about hacking off a huge chunk with the mass of 3 blades with the Mach 3.  A bit pricey and if the razor came at the same price as the Mach 3 I would commit to the upgrade, (Very Hard for guys to change hygeine products, we love the good old reliables).  If you do not have a Mach 3 then I recommend purchasing the Fusion.  Bottom line: Close shave, nice sideburn and stray hair trimmer, nice overall design of the handle, and a good looking razor.  Thanks.    "

The packaging looks legitimate, and was sealed.  The razors themselves looked cheaply made, and the blades were not very well aligned.  Some protrude further from others, and this was definitely noticeable when shaving with them.  I\'ve also read reports from anonymous Gillette factory employees hinting that the refill razors are of lower quality than the blades included in the complete razor package.  I guess the goal it to impress you with the starter pack with a comfortable shave and blades that last weeks, then make the money off you with the pricey refills of lower quality that require more frequent replacement.  I don\'t know whether this is evidence of that theory, or if these blades are not authentic.Either way, I was not impressed with these blades.  The pull the hair out of my face and leave painful irritation and red bumps.  Up until this point I have been picking up the $4 Pro Glide razors with 2 blades included.  I had no problems getting a comfortable shave with the Pro Glide package, but haven\'t tried the Pro Glide refills either.My suggestion is to avoid these alltogether, and perhaps try the Pro Glide refills.  Or skip all the chance, and continue stocking up on $4 Pro Glide razors when they go on sale here at Amazon every couple months.    "

I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this product.First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910. This electric toothbrush was great. I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare. My only gripe was the replacements are a bit on the pricy side. Moving on, I decided to replace the Sonicare (gave to my wife) with the Oral-B 3000. My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line. Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.As an owner of both, I find them similar in a sense, that they are both out (the toothbrushes of course) to perform the same job. The Sonicare did its job just fine. However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch. Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it\'s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.Onto the Oral-B. This brush has performed great. The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease) so I don\'t bleed as much. The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare and I really see no difference other than the size of the head. Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean). I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip. Although, it\'s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work. Plus, I always rinse the brush afterwards with hot water.The battery life appears to be great. I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days. The vibration and strength is great the company claims (40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute). The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \'off\'.The toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation. The build quality seems good to me. I have dropped this toothbrush three times over the span of three months and the electric toothbrush survived without any visual damage or cracks.The charging does take quite some time until it is fully charged. However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night. Therefore, the brush has hours of charging before its next use. One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG. This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first. Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit. Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don\'t even really notice it.In closing, I like this toothbrush. I gave it four stars because while I think it\'s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let\'s face it, it\'s a toothbrush right? Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road). Both the Oral-B and the Sonicare, have their difference. But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease. I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I do.And remember, I do NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can\'t go wrong either way."

I was hesitant to buy the proglide since I knew it was just an \'improved\' version of the fusion. I figured this was just an attempt to sell us something all us fusion owners already had and my suspicion was furthered by other reviews posted here, which said the proglide was not much of an improvement over the fusion. But I decided to try it as I love new toys and though I really like the fusion I don\'t think it is perfect as occasionally it does give me razor burn. So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion. I don\'t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced. Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn\'t think it was perfect. But the proglide is so good I\'m not sure what the next step in shaving evolution will be as I feel this is as good as it gets. Definitely worth the $11 or so to switch from the fusion    "

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos "

The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.In particular, note that the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per second, and does not have a battery charging indicator. All of which are present just one level up in the Professional Care 1000.To me the lack of a quadrant timer is a big disappointment - I don\'t want to be watching a clock while brushing if I don\'t  have to. The gentle thrumming of the Professional Care 1000 every 30 seconds is a very nice pacer.The brushes in the Professional Care series not only add quadrant timers, but also are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second, and have battery charge indicators.As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.Overall, I found the Vitality to be lacking features that I rely on. Hence my rating. I\'d strongly recommend that you consider the Professional Care 1000 as the minimum entry level functionality for a brush.

I use to have to trim down my semi-beard with an electric razor and then shave, but now I use the ProGlide and it literally \'glides\' through my stubble for a nice clean shave. I also like how the stubble doesn\'t get caught in between the blades. I use to have to bang the razor against the side of the sink to get the captured stubble hairs to come out of the razor, but those days are now long gone.If anyone is reviewing replacement blades (as I am doing here), there should be no question as to the satisfaction of the product (proved by the continuing purchase of the product).

It cuts shaving time.  And over time, I\'ve found that I have to shave less.  Due to having to take fewer swipes with the blade, I\'ve also found that my skin isn\'t as irritated.

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $19.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are three of them).  There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $9.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!"

I brook down and bought the version with the SmartGuide. My thought was what the heck even though I thought I did not require it. I have say that there have been times when I would have stopped brushing before 2 minutes are up because I thought 2 minutes had gone by. Note that the toothbrush pulsates every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants and pulsates three times at the two minute mark, so you don\'t really need the SmartGuide. It is still nice to check while brushing and the clock is a nice feature as well. For Christmas I got my wife the same toothbrush, but it now seems to be called the 5000. I have to say it is hard to figure out all the models and sets Oral-B creates. I told my wife that when you first use the toothbrush you will feel as if your teeth are going to shake right out of your mouth and she agreed. After a couple of uses, you become totally use to the brush. I have read negative reviews in which people stated this toothbrush makes their gums bleed, I can only assume they have gum problems and brushing action was too much for their gums. Without a doubt my teeth are much cleaner with this brush. I am not always good about flossing, and I would notice that when I got around to flossing again after period of not flossing that my gums were sore the following day. I noticed tarter build up as well. With the Triumph/5000, I never notice these problems now. Of course this toothbrush is not a substitute for not flossing, but I feel it really helps if you don\'t always floss. Our kids have now used our toothbrushes as well for the last few months and most importantly they are brushing for a full two minutes. Prior to this my son was closer to bushing for 10 seconds than 2 minutes. I figured too that the newness of the brush would have worn off with them, but they still seem to like it. Battery life is good as well. I get about 11 days between charges, but I also brush between 2.5 minutes and 3 minutes every time I brush. With that factored in I would say a 2 minute brusher would get pretty close to 2 weeks on a charge. Bottom line is this is a great product. So much so that I hauled it with me on an 8-day trip to Europe, and it went in my backpack not my checked luggage. I still take a manual toothbrush on overnight trips, but I sure hate not having this toothbrush with me."

I even bought them.  But, even though I have no financial reasons constraining my purchase of this example of our \'finest\' technology, I think there could be some misplaced priorities in a society that would spend almost $4 for a razor blade for their razor that vibrates while shaving via a little battery propelled motor.  Do we really need this product to satify our need to look so nice, or could we feed a few more people with the same amount?  Or do we buy it simply because it is the best?  Or, perhaps we need to by this product to assure Gillette makes a fat margin after they pay their marketing people who make up an eight word name for this product (if we count the hyphenated word as two)?  I think men should stop shaving until Gillette finds a way to sell these things for less than $2.  The world would not end if we let our beards grow and reduce their sales to next to nothing.  The worst that would probably happen is they would be forced to sell their company at a huge discount from its current value to a buyer who would pay so little for the company that the blades could be sold for an amount significantly less than $2.  Could we even survuve in a world that no longer produces $4 razor blades?  I bought these blades because they are the best available, but I really do not need the best available.  They really do not do anything of value for me.  I just think it is incredible that we have been sold on the idea that we need a smooth shave.  Now we have guys who shave their heads so they will not reveal their natural loss of hair.  And some guys are shaving their bodies because they think their hair is in the wrong place or their girlfriend or boyfriend do not like hair in the \'wrong\' place.  I think our thoughts are in the wrong place.  I believe we all have the right to appear the way we wish.  But I also have the right to chuckle at my self and others who think $4 razor blades are great stuff.  I rated this product with five stars because it works well, but I reduced it to three stars because it is so unnecessary.  While this is an unnecessary product, it has no real objectionable purpose other than its reflection of how we squander our assets at time when we criticize our government for its outrageous spending choices that are driving our country to financial failure.  In conclusion, do we have the moral authority to demand a like reduction in our wasteful government spending while we continue to buy $4 razor blades.  The answer must only be \'Yes\'.  Our government should not have any control of private spending, but the electorate must have total control of government spending via the House of Representatives even with items of insignificant amounts.  Even though this example is related to razor blades which seem insignificant, our government\'s thinking in this regard is they should be spending as little as possible to accomplish a specific purpose and then only when they have determined that the purpose is one that is worthwhile and necessary.  I editted this review only to clarify a point that seemed unclear after I posted it.For those who do not appreciate the social and political commentary, I apologize.    "

When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It\'s worth the money.    "

A crest representative came to my office, presented information that made sense and had literature that this brush was the only toothbrush to show increased efficacy in independent testing.  Anyway I bought several for my parents and myself and have been impressed.What I like:-Makes your teeth \'feel\' noticeably cleaner, like they feel when they\'ve just been cleaned at the dental office-Wireless display motivates me to brush longer than I normally would, I\'ll be honest I don\'t know where they got the recommended 2 minute timeframe, but I do it to see the smiley face on the indicator-Wireless display has PRESSURE INDICATOR; I diagnose wear on teeth at the gum line multiple times everyday.  If this is an issue for you get this brush.  It\'ll save you money at the dentist and stop you from harming your teeth-Well made, handle is thin and ergonomic, charger has a small footprint on the counter, no electrical components exposed and everything feels sturdy-Wide selection of brush heads that are reasonably priced ($40 for a 2 year supply at Costco).  Two heads stand out to me.  The first is the funky looking one, which actually provides a floss like action between teeth.  NOT a substitute for flossing but I have noticed considerably less debris removed when I do floss after using this brush.  Also there is an orthodontic (braces) brush that gets in-between the teeth and the braces.  If you are plunking down the thousands for your child to have braces get this brush / attachment, otherwise when the braces a removed there is a good chance the teeth will have unsightly white halos around where the brackets were which is actually decalcification which is the start of cavities.Overall I\'m very impressed with this brush so it is most defiantly \'dentist recommended\' by myself.  My parents absolutely love it."

This is one of my rare exceptions.  So why am I do ing this?  Last April I developed a blood clot in my right calf as well as a small one just above my knee.  As is usual in these cases, I was placed on the anticoagulation medicine Warfarin (the generic form of Coumadin) for six months.  This past saturday I was officially taken off Warfarin.Why do I bring all this up?  I was told in April that I was going to have to be very careful not to cut myself shaving.  If I did, I might have a great deal of trouble stopping the bleeding.  I had bought this razor literally the week before my blood clot.  I had been using the Mach 3 before this and often cut myself using it.  I was somewhat dubious about using this new razor and its five blade, but I liked the very, very close shave it gave me.  So I stuck with it.  The result?  In six months I did not cut myself a single time.  This is far and away the best razor I\'ve ever used.  It gives an amazingly close shave and protects my skin from scraping or cutting better than anything I\'ve ever used.So thanks Gillette for not making me find out what cutting myself when shaving would have been like.

So goes my old fashioned \'manual\' toothbrush for a newfangled electric model. Okay, so I am not so old that I actually talk that way, but sometimes change is hard.As this is my first powered toothbrush, I cannot offer any comparison to models of old, but I can tell you that using the Oral-b 3000 is surely a different experience from just plain old brushing. First off, the round head shape definitely seems to do a great job of cleaning teeth; its shape allows for the bristles to envelope the tooth and I can feel its cleaning efforts at work. And, for those of you who have a tendency to scour their teeth with a toothbrush and scrape off the enamel, the Oral-b 3000 comes with a pressure sensor that will warn you when you are using too much force.Overall, my mouth feels cleaner after just a few days of use and I can tell it will likely make a difference in my dental hygiene.Something to note... If you have a high fear of dentists and their tools, then you should be aware that using the Oral-b 3000 will sound like you are in the dentist\'s chair. Nothing to fear, but it is a little shocking for the unprepared."

The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.The comfort of the blade is by far the best I\'ve experienced. It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.The blade on the back I have found to be very useful which is something that, if I remember correctly, the Sensor doesn\'t even have.

I have used every really good shampoo for fine hair for several decades, so I have many different shampoos to compare this one to.After using Pantene\'s Pro-v for a few days, I am extremely impressed with it having all the great qualities that I require from a really good fine hair shampoo. The first thing I look for is a totally clear shampoo, because if you can see through it, it\'s not going to weigh down your fine hair, and this Pantene Pro-v is perfectly crystal clear. It has a lovely, very faint light citrus smell, which I like, as I don\'t like shampoo smells to clash with my favorite fragrances. It cleans really well and leaves your fine hair full of body and lift, which is exactly what a great fine hair shampoo should do.The main difference I noticed between my shampoo and this Pantene Pro-v is that Pantene Pro-v cleans really well, as in thoroughly super clean, leaving my hair much fuller with absolutely nothing weighing it down. When your hair is that clean, it\'s very important to use a good conditioner to replace lost moisture. Fine hair needs a very special type of conditioner that will not weigh hair down and flatten it, and the best conditioner I have ever found is one that rinses out minutes after it is put on after shampooing.This is a lovely light scented shampoo that cleans extremely well and leaves your fine hair feeling light, full and bouncy.

I\'ve used the previous Fusion Power razors in the past with great results.  The cartridges are expensive, so I\'ve alternated between the Fusion and a Merkur safety razor with Feather blades.  When I want a really close shave and don\'t have a lot of time to spend shaving, I opt for the Fusion.  It requires less preparation time for my beard and I don\'t have to be nearly as careful while shaving.  Also, typically one pass does the job with the Fusion.As for the new model, the Proglide, there are improvements.  They\'ve created better spacing between the blades to help keep the razor from clogging.  I think this also improves drying, which should lengthen the life of the blades.  I don\'t care how much, or what kind of coating they put on the blades, they will eventually rust.  It seems also that the trim blade is improved.  It\'s very handy for getting the tight spots, like right under your nose.  That\'s a problem area with a safety razor and certainly with a Mach 3.  All in all, this is a great razor and one that I would use every day if the replacement blades weren\'t so expensive.  I\'ll keep this puppy in the rotation, especially for travel and those times when I don\'t have much time on my hands.Recommended, but only 4 stars because of the price.    "

The Braun-branded trimmer is quite powerful and is perfect for shaping up my facial hair. I use it for sideburns and to keep a unibrow at bay. Gets the job done very nicely. Nothing to plug in, it runs off a single battery and the included stand is very space-saving.If you\'re already a Fusion user, this is a nice upgrade. If not, consider it just for the trimmer.

I have long been a fan of Pantene products since it acts as an excellent de-tanglee solution. The Fine Hair Solutions conditioner is the same consistancy/weight of any other Pantene conditioner as well as maintaining the detangle benefit.I was somewhat surprised that this actually did add moderate volume to my own hair. In my case one might call it \'fluffier\' but my hair is still shiney, healthy and easy to manage. This took about three applications to reach my current stage of volume. I have been using the product for three weeks.I have not actually decided if I like the volume/fluff.

The first few daysI used it, it felt like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  My teeth felt smooth and clean.  This is a awesome toothbrush, small round bristle head is better than the sonicare long shaped one, becuase you pay more attention toeach tooth and it\'s really fast and easy to use and brush.  Now I look forward to brushing everyday and I also brought one for my wife and three kids.Update:  I went to costco and they had the same tooth but a professional version, which cost more money and works the same.  My recommendation is that if you can afford it then get the professional version or if not, this one works just as fine and maybe even better since it saves you money."

I will cut myself into a million pieces with the cheap disposable blades, and even previous versions of the mach 3 blade still left my skin irritated.  Now that the m3 power has come out, the shave is so much less irritating and, when combined with m3 power shave gel, it performs even better! The green lubrication strip is amazing! The blades just glide right over the skin with the new addition, however I typically find that the lubrication only lasts me 2 shaves, and then it starts to nick up my skin. The blades break down to about $1.00 a piece, which turns out to be $0.50 per shave for me (for the blade product alone, not incuding shave cream, new batteries, etc.), which is a bit high. The blade is great but the price is a lot. If you are willing to spend the extra money for a great shave, I have not found a better razor.UPDATED: The Gillette Fusion Power blades are even better than this product. At the time when I wrote this review, Fusion had not even been released. After using Fusion Power, I cannot return to this product any longer. Fusion provides an even LESS irritating shave to my skin that the M3 Power did, and seems to trim quicker and slide smoothly across my face with the proper shaving cream. I love the addition of the single precision blade on the backside of the razor blade, this provides me with a quick easy way to trim my sideburns evenly.    "

This is the first product that works just as well. It is a powdery cream that actually feels softer and smoother going on than any other product I\'ve tried, probably due to the multitude of tiny openings in the metered delivery system and the very wide application platform.

The \'larger handle\' is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size. The shave was no closer, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide.

Despite their abundantly mass-produced stock, they have been well-built (some more than others) and have stood the test of time.  These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I\'m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  While Gillette\'s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  Where I know some bumps on my cheeks and chin should be, the vibration may confuse me and cause me to improperly shave and leave some spots thicker than others.The blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I\'m considering doing the ol\'-fashioned wet shaving.All in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.

It\'s very thick/wide and is weird when holding in your hand.  My in-laws have electric toothbrushes that are much thinner, but I don\'t think they\'re as high-end as these.I\'m wondering if the additional thickness is from a better battery in this model because the battery lasts quite a while before you have to recharge it.Overall, I think this toothbrush is very good for even the normal price.

I could not believe the difference between my regular disposable razor and this one in terms of how smooth the Embrace felt while shaving.  In fact, I couldn\'t tell if it was doing anything--which felt weird at first because, with my regular razor, I can clearly tell that it is.  Even stranger was that, while I couldn\'t FEEL that I was shaving with the Embrace, I had razor burn when I put on my deodorant after shaving, whereas I usually don\'t have any razor burn when using my regular razor.  It\'s very possible that I may have unconsciously pressed harder because I was used to feeling my other razor and that caused the burn, so this could be \'user error\' and not a product fault.  Once I am more accustomed to using it and have broken out of my old habits with my old razor, I will have a better idea of which it is.Design-wise, the gel-grip handle is great for good grip in the shower, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the \'pod\' that sticks on the shower wall and holds the razor and the extra blade cartridge.  However, once I took the razor out of the pod to shave, I couldn\'t quite figure out how to get it BACK into the pod.  There is only 1 way it fits and it took me a few tries to find it (it seems obvious, because you know it has to fit into the pod at the narrowest point of the handle but, even with that assumption, it still took a few tries).All in all, I was impressed with the Venus Embrace Razor.  I took off 1/2 star because, while I love concept of the pod, I thought it should be simpler to get the razor back into it without having to think about it, and I took off another 1/2 star because I got razor burn when I don\'t usually (but as noted, that may have been my fault).Edited several weeks (and numerous uses) later to add:1. Once I got used to using a lighter touch with this razor vs. my old one, the razor burn problem substantially lessened to the point where I am having little or no razor burn now.2.  Once I got it in my head that the razor always goes back in the pod with the blades facing IN (which make sense), I have found it much easier to get the razor back in the pod without fumbling around.

Normally I wouldn\'t buy a toothbrush for $100, but in a few weeks when I get $50 back, it will justify me spending $50, even though that seems a little steep for a toothbrush.  But nevertheless, its a steal of a deal right now.So onto the product. Overall I am very pleased with it.  My teeth felt amazingly smooth and clean after the first brushing.Since I\'m not an automatic toothbrush guru, I am not sure of the sizes and noise of others.  In my own opinion, I feel like it is a tad heavy and large.  But once again, its got a motor and battery in it unlike my manual toothbrush.I read other reviews about the base of the unit and storage compartment for the brush heads being too large.  I however have to disagree with that.  The base unit is just larger than the base of the toothbrush, as the toothbrush sits in it to charge.  The storage part holds 4 tips and snaps to the base.  Once again, I don\'t know how others compare, but to me the size of it seems perfect for my counter space (about 8 sq ft).The plug however seems large.  But oh well, I\'m also not an electrician so I don\'t know why it needs to be that big.The Wireless Smartguide is pretty cool as well.  It gives you a timer and choice of count up or count down modes and a ingenious idea of having 4 zones (for each section of teeth).  This 4 zone thing blinks for 30 seconds indicating which zone you should be brushing in and provides a visual timer of when to move on.  It makes it idiot proof for brushing for the correct time.  I find myself brushing for about 4 minutes because the 2 minutes fly by which is a plus to the health of my teeth and gums.I am really impressed with the \'extras\'.  Really, when you buy electronics you ALWAYS need to get your own batteries for it.  With this, the Wireless Smartguide came with 2 AA batteries in it, as well as 2 more.  4 batteries!!! You never get batteries included let alone EXTRA batteries.  Ha, needless to say, that\'s coll Oral-B.  You also get 2 brushing heads, the normal flossification head and the pro-white head.  That\'s another plus with getting another brush head included in the package.  You also get the travel case.  Which I haven\'t used yet, but still cool.I have read others complain of the \'roughness\' of the brushing.  The manual does state that it can take time for your teeth to become used to the brush and your gums may bleed some.  I however had no problems gum bleeding or feeling like the toothbrush was too rough.The only negative I can say about this toothbrush is sometimes while brushing the chewing surfaces of my teeth, the back of the brush head hits the opposite chewing surface.  It doesn\'t hurt, but it doesn\'t feel great either.  Guess I just need to remember and learn to keep my mouth open more while brushing.All in all, great product and would definitely recommend to my family and friends during the promotion period where you get 50% back.  Can\'t wait for my rebate check!"

He highly recommended the Oral B.  So I switched and what a huge difference.  It goes around the tooth which is what their instruments do at the dentist.  After using it for a almost 3 months, I can see a huge difference!  My gums and teeth feel clean but not all tore up.  I can\'t wait to go back to the Periodontist and show him the difference in my whole mouth.  The ORal B 5000 has a little digital clock that shows you when you\'re brushing too hard which has made a big difference in the way I brush and a 30 second timer to show you when to switch quadrants.  I\'ve always thought that really scrubbing my teeth was the way to go but not so! This brush shows you how to do it right.  I\'m excited about my new findings as I\'m spent so much time, money and pain in improving my gums. I feel for the first time, I\'m getting it right!"

Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don\'t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don\'t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don\'t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.  I\'ll figure it out."

Been an Oral B user for over a decade,"Oral B SmartSeries 5000The Oral B 5000 is the top of the line electric toothbrush. I used to have an older Oral B from the late 1990s that worked well up until the point where I couldn\'t find it around my house. The Ni-Accu battery pack was running strong and I could have used it for another 5-10 years. Then I got a few Oral B Vitality units from the dentist for free, which use inferior Ni-Cd batteries and have a battery life of about 3-5 days with regular usage. My old Oral B could last 3 weeks on a single charge.The cool aspect of these Oral B units is that a lot of their brushes are compatible. The Precision Clean, Sensitive, Polishing, and new Floss Action are interchangeable with a few exceptions  (like the Cross/Dual action garbage). The Floss Action worked horribly in my Vitality, but seems to work incredibly well with this SmartSeries 5000. I think it has to do with the RPM/speed of the motor. The Vitality comes across as grindy/noisy when it is operating, while the SmartSeries 5000 is smoother and faster.While brushing in the Daily Cleaning or Sensitive modes with the 5000, the Floss Action brush really works to clean my teeth and gumline. It doesn\'t hurt like it did with the Vitality! The Precision Clean brushes are probably the de-facto standard, but I invite you to try the Floss Action heads just to see how it feels. I also have the Sensitive brush heads that I want to try later on. I can tell you for a fact that my teeth felt cleaner brushing with the same Floss Action head on the Smart Series 5000 versus using the Vitality or a regular tooth brush.What does the Smart Series 5000 offer over other brushes? Well, the 5000 has a LCD indicator on the unit itself to tell you the battery\'s state of charge. Neat gimmick, but I have wondered in the past whether my toothbrush was good to go in terms of state of charge. Wonder no more, because you get a bar graph indicator!The 5000 has 2 buttons: one to turn on/off and another to select different cleaning modes. It defaults to daily cleaning (same as Deep Cleaning), and progresses to feather/sensitive, massaging, polishing, and deep clean. The Deep Clean changes the timer to increase the amount of time for your brushing, but it is the same speed as the daily cleaning mode. The timer defaults to counting up, and fluctuates the brush head speed every 30 seconds to tell you to switch quadrants in your mouth, and does the typical Oral B twitch at 2 minutes to tell you that you\'re done.The wireless timer/clock module is a neat gimmick offered on the 5000 and not the 4000. I don\'t find that it is particularly mandatory, but It does have a clock and changes to a timer when you use the brush. It also lights up a red LED if you press too hard on the brush head while brushing. While experimenting, I found that you really had to jam down on the brush head to cause it to cut power to the brush. Chances are you\'re not brushing hard with an Oral B because you want the RPM\'s to do the work with the brush. I tried SonicAire and other products, including Oral B\'s cross-action, but found the traditional Oral B to be the ultimate.The Smart Series 5000 comes with 1 Floss action head and 1 polishing head. The bristles are also indicators, you\'re supposed to change them when the blue color disappears halfway down. I find that this generally occurs every 6 months, and you can order new heads from Amazon for a lot less than buying them in stores (usually).The Smart Series 5000 also comes with a plastic hard travel case, and a slim charger unit that is more of a ring than a peg like on the older models. This makes cleaning a lot easier. The included battery is a NiMH cell, which means it has a much higher capacity than NiCd and doesn\'t suffer the memory effect. I am going to keep the Vitality as a travel brush, so if someone from the hotel nicks the Vitality, it\'s not a big loss.The Smart Series 5000 is a very smart investment for your personal dental hygiene. I brush with Oral B at least once a day (at night before I go to sleep). My dentist and hygienist always mention how clean my teeth and gums look, so the Oral B must be doing its job!Overall: 5/5 starsUPDATE: 4 MAR 2011After running the Oral B Smart Series 5000 without charging it, I noticed that I can easily get 10 days of normal routine usage (2-3 times a day for 1 person) before the battery meter starts blinking with 1 bar remaining. I used it for about 12 days and estimate I can get another 2-3 days before the battery is totally drained. As someone that travels routinely for business, I can opt to not bring my charger along for week long trips because I know the battery can last at the least 10 days before needing a charge. I\'d push it as far as 15 days!UPDATE: 19 NOV 2011I decided to push the Oral B 5000 as long as possible without charging it to see what would happen. After 22 days, it was still running fairly strong. I can detect a decrease in RPM because the voltage is probably too low. So that is roughly 44-60 minutes of total run time. It will easily handle most business travels without lugging around the charger. I noted that the low battery icon started flashing after 9 days of usage or roughly 18-20 minutes of operation, but it kept running and was still running after a total of 22 days on a single charge."
