2708,2779,20111110,B003UKKHB4,5,"November 10, 2011",A184CWF8Y9604I,Excellent product for improved dental hygiene,"I love my Oral B 3000 because it makes brushing my teeth less of chore and cleans them really good leaving my mouth fresh for hours, plus Amazon sold it for $25 less than Walmart...an unbelievable deal!"
2801,2875,20110227,B003UKM90Q,5,"February 27, 2011",A146DNDI8KRP74,This toothbrush is saving my gums!,"I had an issue with a couple of puffy and painful gum areas when I would floss.  After using this toothbrush, the problem has stopped.  The toothbrush really packs a punch for such a small head.  I love the size because it can get all around your teeth and close to the gumline.  I also love the timer.  Now I know that I was definately not brushing for the full 2 minutes.  This toothbrush save my gums and will probably save me money at the dentist\'s office."
2233,2285,20101219,B002HWS9GG,4,"December 19, 2010",A3500E8G8J9V3H,Great product,"I\'ve had a couple Braun Oral-B\'s.  This lives up to expectations.  I probably should have bought the 4000 instead as, the 5000 has more features than I really needed but, at the price, it was too good a deal to pass up."
2614,2677,20100826,B003UKKH6O,4,"August 26, 2010",A4IL0CLL27Q33,7 days so far and a noticeable improvement over a standard brush,"This is my first electric toothbrush, and I am impressed. I really can tell the difference in my teeth\'s cleanliness and shine after only three days. I especially notice the difference on the biting surfaces, which seem smoother somehow. I also notice that when I floss after using this product, there is less \'stuff\' pulled out by the floss. I take that discovery to mean that this brush really does get in between teeth to remove food that normal brushes miss.A couple of other interesting features.1 - after 2 minutes, the brush noticeably pulses to alert you that you have passed the first brushing milestone - the minimum recommended brushing time. After 2 additional minutes, it pulses you again to let you know you should stop, having reached the recommended maximum brushing time. My wife, an exceptionally conscientious brusher, was amazed at how long 2 minutes really is. She had been under brushing for a long time.2 - The recharger acts as a stand for the unit, but you do not need to keep it plugged in to an outlet. A full charge lasts at least a week or more.3 - The unit seems well engineered, is easy to hold and the brush heads that come with the unit seem to fit \'just right\' in the mouth.4 - The first time I used it, the vibration was a bit surprising. It took my 2 or 3 uses until the novelty wore off, though brushing my tongue results is still a work in process. By the way, for those worried about sensitivity to vibration, I have mildly sensitive teeth, and the vibration has caused absolutely NO discomfort to any of my teeth.5 - Some people mention in their reviews that the brush was harsh on the gums the first time that they used it. I agree that the brush is a bit stiff the first time you use it, but after 1-2 uses, they seemed to soften a bit and now the brush seems to be very gentle on my gums.My only problem with this unit is that my wife and I are going to fight over it when I travel on business...Actually, there are a couple of short comings, but these should be easy to address. First, both of the brushing heads (which are detachable) are identical. A color band or some other distinguishing mark would be helpful to people sharing the device. Also, there is no battery indicator. I found out this morning that the battery was dying, when in the period of 30 seconds, the brush went from what seemed like full power to no power at all. Recharging it for 5 minutes allowed me to finish, but that\'s not an acceptable design choice. Perhaps a small red LED or an audible chime alerting users to a low battery will make it in to future designs."
715,732,20100606,B0002M5JO8,5,"June 6, 2010",ATLSSH30T12PB,Oral B replacement heads at a decent price,"Oral b claims to have our oral hygiene as their top priority, designing products to aid in saving our teeth.  For the replacement heads, they give us the indicator bristles so we will know when they should be replaced.  This is all wonderful, right? Then why do they charge such a high price for the replacement heads?  My instinct is to use them until there is not a trace of blue left in the indicators.  The list price for a 3 pack of replacement heads is $22, and with 1/3 off, using Amazon takes some of the sting out of keeping updated - an action that Oral B should be taking!"

When I contacted the company, they wanted me to incur the cost of returning the product. After complaining to the service rep, the company finally relented and provided me with a prepaid shipping label. After the product was returned, it took another 10 days for the company to send me the correct product. Accordingly, I would rate my overall experience as fair and I am not sure if I would order other products from this company"
2368,2423,20120128,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 28, 2012",A1PLOIFMHQ9M7C,Great toothbrush,"First off I\'m a dentist.I\'ve never recommended electronic toothbrushes in the past since their benefit over a regular toothbrush had not been scientifically proven in studies (the American Dental Assoc had called a tooth brush a fluoride applicator).  A crest representative came to my office, presented information that made sense and had literature that this brush was the only toothbrush to show increased efficacy in independent testing.  Anyway I bought several for my parents and myself and have been impressed.What I like:-Makes your teeth \'feel\' noticeably cleaner, like they feel when they\'ve just been cleaned at the dental office-Wireless display motivates me to brush longer than I normally would, I\'ll be honest I don\'t know where they got the recommended 2 minute timeframe, but I do it to see the smiley face on the indicator-Wireless display has PRESSURE INDICATOR; I diagnose wear on teeth at the gum line multiple times everyday.  If this is an issue for you get this brush.  It\'ll save you money at the dentist and stop you from harming your teeth-Well made, handle is thin and ergonomic, charger has a small footprint on the counter, no electrical components exposed and everything feels sturdy-Wide selection of brush heads that are reasonably priced ($40 for a 2 year supply at Costco).  Two heads stand out to me.  The first is the funky looking one, which actually provides a floss like action between teeth.  NOT a substitute for flossing but I have noticed considerably less debris removed when I do floss after using this brush.  Also there is an orthodontic (braces) brush that gets in-between the teeth and the braces.  If you are plunking down the thousands for your child to have braces get this brush / attachment, otherwise when the braces a removed there is a good chance the teeth will have unsightly white halos around where the brackets were which is actually decalcification which is the start of cavities.Overall I\'m very impressed with this brush so it is most defiantly \'dentist recommended\' by myself.  My parents absolutely love it."
2767,2840,20110704,B003UKM90Q,5,"July 4, 2011",A19R25Z4W50SMT,great power brush for excellent price,"Had to get a new one after my cat knocked over my old brush & it fell into the toilet. I was due to buy more refills, & decided I would rather buy a new set of power brush.This brush makes my mouth feel so clean just like the one it replace that cost 3X as much. Sure this one does not have extra features like digital timer, 30 sec notifier, charging light indicator, etc, etc. but after using this brush for several days now, I\'ve come to one conclusion-I don\'t miss not having the extra features. It cleanses my teeth & gums just as good as the more expensive model."
2731,2803,20110827,B003UKKHB4,4,"August 27, 2011",A3FS5XGAQHPPP7,Oral B Professional,"Good battery life, and brush holder device that comes with it is well designed. It seems to be very easy to do the 2 minute cycle, which the dentist should be happy about. My orthodontist recommended this to our family and hopefully it will help for future check-ups. If you\'re a manual brusher this takes a little getting used to, but after a week you will enjoy it."

I confess, I sometimes have to remind myself to remove the brush head and rinse that separately after brushing. The whole experience is seamless. My friend bought this as well and loves it. I have recommended it to many people who have gone on to love it.I was lucky to get this while there was a 50% (if I recall correctly) discount going on.If you can get any discount on this, try to to do so.

I have used Oral B Sonic Complete for approx. 5 years and will continue to do so.  I recently purchased it for my 14 year old son and last year when I took him for his 6 month cleaning, the dentist was amazed at the difference in my son\'s teeth.  My son\'s cleaning was minimal.

But this toothbrush can last a long time (new alkaline can last at least a month; brush twice daily for 2 mins) and it is a good travel toothbrush. Not bad for the price on amazon.

This is a game changer - specifically with how it makes your mouth  feel after you are done. In 1-2 minutes per night your mouth feels completely and sparkly clean.Great stuff!"

Gets my teeth very clean, more so than any other brush in the Oral-B line up (and I\'ve tried every one!). The size is a bit larger than the regular model, but still remains sufficiently maneuverable. The hardest area to hit is behind the front teeth. It can be done, but there\'s more of a mess than with the smaller brushes.My only complaint is that they are a bit rougher on the gum line than the Ultrasoft Oral-B model. So, I switch off between the two - couple of days with the Floss Action, then a couple of days with the Ultrasoft.Great price if you catch it on one of the price dips. Highly recommend."

I feel the Floss action is a waste of money, just a way to get a little more out your pocket to brush less."
1318,1349,20111103,B0014IKO6C,4,"November 3, 2011",A4L1LP6JPYY66,"Pretty close, but could be better.","Supposed to be the exact fit for my Braun coffee maker.  My original split at the bottom and I continued to use it for several years before finally buying this replacement.  As several other reviewers have noted, this filter is not an exact fit.  It fits pretty close and works fine.  I just miss that perfect fit that the original filter had.  I would give it three stars except that it still functions flawlessly in my coffee maker.To the people who are getting grounds through, change your grind to a slightly courser grind.  I use a grind a little between the one I use for paper filters and my French press.  Closer to the press than the paper setting.  I grind all my coffee at home in a burr grinder which I also recommend."

I have been a Sonicare user for close to 10 years and recently bought another Oral B prouduct that has a rotating brush.  The product was good but I missed the Sonic action I have been use to.  The toothbrush is a great value over 50% less than Sonicare products and seems to work exactly the same.  Oral B and Sonicare has a 2 minute timer but Sonicare turns off the device while Oral B as a pulsating \'notice.\'  I have not purchased replacement heads but so far I have been very happy.Additionally I travel a lot and the toothbrush easily keeps a charge for at least a week and is compact.  I never travel with the charging attachement.

The Vitality feels like it oscillates faster.  It comes with two oval Floss Action brush heads.  My spare round Sensitive brush heads also work. (The manufacturer\'s web site has complete information on which brush heads fit the different models.)  Using the oval Floss Action brush head once a day, it does a superior job of removing calculus buildup in the most troublesome area behind my lower front teeth.

But I discovered, like another reviewer, that the batteries very frequently needed changing. And, this toothbrush requires 2 batteries rather than just 1.  Then, after only three months, the toothbrush began to stop and start while I was using it.  Finally, it completely died.  Very disappointing.  I\'m glad another reviewer gave me the idea of getting an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  I might try that."

I got immediate results and compliments from my dentist during semi-annual check-ups.  That positive feedback lead me to continue to use the device.Now after after years of using the conventional brush head, I made the switch to this head.  By far the best yet; seems to clean even better in between teeth.  Doesn\'t appear to wear out as fast.  Worth the price."

That was a big reason I choose this specific flosser over others that are offered--I def. think they are misleading...you think you\'re getting flosser that will have lots of minty-freshness....and there\'s no flavor at all.

2004,2051,20110907,B002HWS9GG,5,"September 7, 2011",AS66RJK556QVY,Outstanding product. Horrible shipping,"This toothbrush is awesome. When I first got it, I was so eager to use it that I didn\'t wait for it to charge fully. I only got about 30 seconds of brushing before the thing died and I was forced to curb my enthusiasm and wait for it to charge. However, after the 30 seconds of using it, I could already feel a huge difference. My teeth felt as polished and clean as they were after a professional hygienist worked on them for 30 minutes. When it was fully charged, I tried again and can I just say WOW. That toothbrush packs a heavy punch. It\'s very high powered, which is just what I need to get all the daily grossness off my teeth.I bought the toothbrush during Oral-B\'s discount, but I would definitely buy the toothbrush without the discount. After trying this only once, I\'m already in love.The only complaint I have is with the time it took for the toothbrush to actually arrive at my house. That\'s hardly worth knocking down the rating to four stars though.If anyone has doubt about whether or not it\'s worth it, I would encourage them to get the toothbrush while the discount is still valid. I\'ll be singing praises about this brush for a long time to come, and I\'ll have an awesome smile to go with it! :)"

These new heads are even a step above that.  The only draw back is they are much larger and are quite a mouthful.  But they work well so it is worth the trade off.  As for the rechargeable handle, it is the basic handle with an on/off switch so not much to say about it.  It works well and the charge lasts a week or more."

Great when traveling so I don\'t have to pack the charger also. For longer trips I love the compactness of the charge base.The charger base separates from the extra brush holder so it doesn\'t take up much space on the counter and is sleek, clean and modern looking while saving counter space. I live alone and only need one brush head at a time.The rubberized grip is nice but I didn\'t have any slippage with the hard plastic handle on my old Braun.Evidently I\'ve been brushing too hard for a long time.

I find that they clean your teeth great, are comfortable to use, and last a long time. I find I can get a year use out of these brushes before I need to replace them.One tip . . . when you remove the brush from the handle after using, rinse off the inside of the brush. This will ensure that they always slide on and off the handle easily. If you do not do this, the brush can become jammed on the handle due to dried up toothpaste and then you have usually have to damage the brush to get it off the handle. If you take a second to rinse handle and brush after you remove the brush, you will have no troubles."

I have always loved these brushes because the bristles are so stiff.  They remain in almost new condition for a couple of months.  They do a wonderful job cleaning and brushing is a pleasure instead of a chore.  (I have tooth sensitivity and I love the stiff bristles--soft bristles bother my teeth.)  Today I accidentally picked up the Crossaction Pro-Health and I was certainly disappointed.  I noticed the last set of bristles was green instead of white and the head size said large instead of full, but I thought Oral-B had just done a product makeover.  To my disappointment, the Crossaction Pro-Health cannot compare to the original Crossaction.  I just bought the Pro-Health today and the bristles are softer than those of my 3 month old used original Crossaction brush.  If Pro-Health was in big letters and they didn\'t look so similar I wouldn\'t complain, but the toothbrushes look exactly alike and Pro-Health is *tiny* on the packaging, so small that I didn\'t even notice it until I got the packaging out of the trash to include the UPC in my letter to Oral-B regarding the suspected makeover.  And that is how long it took me to realize that Oral-B hadn\'t done a makeover, I just bought the wrong brush.  Ugh...  Do yourself a big favor and buy the Oral-B Crossaction Toothbrush instead of the Oral-B Crossaction Pro-Health Toothbrush.

They should have used a nickel metal hydride or lithium ion/polymer rechargeable battery instead. Or, include an option to use regular AA batteries. Ni-Cad batteries are notoriously memory prone and don\'t really last long at all. In fact, the instructions for this unit state not to leave the charger/stand plugged in unless the unit is ready to be charged up. This is because if you charge it when it isn\'t fully drained, the battery will not last as long on subsequent charges due to the memory issue. Oral-b should be ashamed of themselves for incorporating such a lame battery in what could be a more useful product with a better internal battery.Luckily, I have an old Oral-b power toothbrush that takes regular AA batteries and the brushes from this unit fit on it! So, when the stupid ni-cad battery on this unit fails, I can use my old base and regular AA batteries but still use the dual head brush attachment.I can\'t recommend anyone buy this based on the fact that the battery is not viable. If you can find one that takes regular batteries I think that would be better for you (you can use rechargeable in that if you want)."

It is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I\'ve owned, and my last one lasted 13 years. When it started to loose its charge while I was brushing my teeth I looked at what was available and decided on the 5000.I like that it has a space to store 4 brush heads, so I won\'t have to search for where I placed the extra ones when its time to change it. Also, the contour of the handle is very nice.On one of the reviews I read before I bought it, someone was unhappy with the timer. It\'s a nice, waterproof digital clock and you do not have to sync it up with the toothbrush if you don\'t want to. I did so I could tell when I\'m applying too much pressure. If you do use the timer, at 2 minutes you get a smiley face, and at 2 1/2 minutes it winks at you.The one thing I don\'t really like is that every 30 seconds it pulses to let you know to move to the next area of your mouth, but I do not brush my teeth in sections like they want you to. I asked my Dental Hygienist, who also uses one, and she doesn\'t do it their way either.She also recommended that I leave the handle off the charger until the charge wears down. The toothbrush has a \'Smart\' battery and she has heard of people having problems with the battery not holding a charge if it is keep constantly charging. The handle shows how much charge the battery has so I only charge it once a week or so.The travel case that comes with it is another nice feature.

So I\'ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea. It\'s now just a question of which one to get.In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh. We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it\'s doing a great job. It\'s not \'too mild\'. Our dentist praises us on how well our teeth are cared for. I don\'t see the need for the extra agitation this unit gives.There are no LEDs anywhere that we can see to indicate this unit is charging. It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn\'t being wasted.There\'s similarly no battery indicator.Finally, with the Sonicare, you get a blink every 30 seconds to change mouth quadrants. That way at the end of 2 minutes you know you\'ve handled each quadrant evenly. With this one, you solely get a buzz at the end of 2 minutes to tell you you\'re done. So you have to manage your time yourself. I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually - but there\'s many features they left out."

It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can\'t say that they appear whiter.  I find that the 30 second timer and two minute marker to be both helpful yet a bit annoying- its nice to know how long you\'ve been working on a section of teeth but I tend to brush longer than the recommended 2 minutes so it isn\'t broken up to my needs.Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  The Pulsonic seems a bit flimsy- like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  I also don\'t feel like the bristles get in between my teeth like the Sonicare did, either.  The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn\'t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.  I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!"

It was a basic rechargeable model with a 2 minute timer.  I wanted at least as much in my replacement.  I decided to spend a little more money for more features and I\'m really happy with the 3000 Professional.  I like the fact that it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to another area of you teeth.  The pressure sensor works but I don\'t know that I\'d ever push hard enough to actually turn it on in use.The minor thing that I don\'t need is the stand accessory which has the holders for additional brush heads.  This could probably be useful for a family that shares a toothbrush and simply swaps heads.  I knew what I was ordering though and that\'s why I\'m still giving it 5 stars.  Maybe make a model with a simpler base for those of us that don\'t need the extra storage?

It came with a 50% off mail-in rebate that made it $61.00 which was a great price. It was $122.00 at the time so I feel like I got a great deal for a top of the line toothbrush. I bought this one to replace my older power toothbrush. It stopped working and would not turn back on one day. So I found this one and got it and do not regret spending the money to get it. I definitely recommend this toothbrush for anyone who likes to get their teeth really clean and feeling clean. This toothbrush comes with great features like five different cleaning modes which I use two of them so far and yet to try the others. It is a must get for really clean teeth.

It\'s almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money. While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year."

It was only when I sought out a remedy and came across studies linking SLS -- sodium lauryl sulfate -- as a major contributor to canker sore outbreaks that I discovered this amazing toothpaste. I have used this toothpaste since it came out on the market and my incidence of outbreaks has diminished nearly 100%. If I do happen to get an outbreak, which will happen if I do not brush at least three times per day, the intensity of the outbreak is significantly reduced and the amount of time the canker sore lasts is only a few days. If you suffer from canker sores to any degree BUY THIS TOOTHPASTE! You will never suffer again.

It holds its charge so that I can leave it off the charger for three days or so, and I still get solid power. The dual brush allows for getting at all areas in the mouth and covers a wide area when held sideways. The toothbrush is fairly lightweight, easy to use and hold. I\'m not sure it always slows down accurately on its timer to encourage the brusher to move to another tooth area, but to me that doesn\'t matter. I brush thoroughly, and this toothbrush makes thorough brushing much easier than a manual toothbrush.The price is more than inexpensive for the quality - it\'s downright super-affordable.

After reading a bunch of online reviews, I settled on the Braun/Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 brush and some extra replacement heads. Upon receiving the toothbrush, I was a little surprised at how large the handle is, but the brush heads are small enough to move around and focus on one tooth at a time, which is awesome. The polishing head is amazing, with the right toothpaste it feels like a dentist\'s cleaning! The flossing head seems to do its job, the long rubber flappers seem to reach further into the crevices between my teeth than an average toothbrush, although it is no substitute for actually flossing. Within the first couple days of owning this toothbrush I can already notice a difference in  my teeth, they feel amazingly clean and already look a touch whiter. The stand-alone display screen is kind of goofy, but I stuck it on my bathroom mirror and don\'t mind it, it\'s always nice to have a bathroom clock.I Highly recommend this toothbrush, those $10 electric brushes don\'t even compare!"

I like to take 2.5 minutes versus the 2 minutes it suggests.The brush head has a more varied profile and seems to get in places the old one didn\'t. The brush cycle is more aggressive and \'feels\' like it is doing a better job, although I am a little worried it might be too strong.

One thing I was told by two dentists is that electric toothbrushes are bad, because people tend to brush too hard when using them, ruining the protective enamel on their teeth.Well, I like to judge things for myself, so I did get one, an Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush. And I like it. I\'m careful not to press down too hard when I use it, and I don\'t believe it\'s harming my teeth. I\'m not as confident about that with the Pulsonic. I also prefer the battery-operated Advance over something that takes up more space around the sink and takes up an outlet. I get compliments for how white my teeth are, and I think the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is partly responsible.The Pulsonic is probably a better toothbrush, but considering the Oral B Advance Power Toothbrush is just $14.99 and does the job for me, I can\'t say it\'s worth the difference."

The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  It\'s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  And children may find it more fun to use.How many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  Typical for Oral B\'s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn\'t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  Separate on and off buttons, are located on the handle.The Pulsar is being packaged and sold in various quantities.  At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B\'s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work."

2248,2300,20101202,B002HWS9GG,4,"December 2, 2010",A3RZXOS53C9JW3,Upgrade from alkaline battery operated Sonicare,The Oral-B is a great toothbrush that gives more options than necessary. Let me just start off by mentioning why I rated this product 4 instead of 5 stars. All of the different setting on the brush seem fairly pointless so I think it it would be easy to downgrade to another Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series Toothbrush without the \'massaging\' \'whitening\' or \'deep clean\' settings. So this isn\'t really a negative aspect of the product but something that the consumer is paying for and doesn\'t seem to be getting any extra benefit. Save yourself the extra cash and just get one of the more basic models; I only use the daily clean setting.Since using the Oral-B I do believe that my teeth gave become more white and have a greater overall brush experience. I think this has much to do with the included \'Pro-White\' head that is included along with the \'Floss Action\' head. The rubber cup on the head really wipes away plaque and buildup. I can\'t really say that the \'Floss Action\' head is all that the name seems to claim but it does seem to be a great everyday head to use when accompanied with daily flossing.Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Oral-B Professional Care Series to anyone looking to take great care of their teeth.

I went into my dentist four months (and zero uses of dental floss) after starting with the Pulsonic and she said \'finally, you\'re actually using dental floss! I\'m so proud of you\'. I didn\'t want to break her heart, so I just nodded and smiled.My only problem with the refills is the stupid pick thing that you have to buy along with the three heads, and thus the three star review.

My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why. Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:- practically no assembly required, it\'s ready to go out of the box- comes with a deck for the charger and slots for 4 heads. Storing the head keeps it cleaner, and you can use this brush for the entire family - just get different color heads and you\'re set.- all you have to do is move the brush around, no pressure needed. In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.- the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles- I love how sensitive the power button is. With CrossAction, I had to jam the button to get the brush going. With the 3000, you literally just tap it.- the brush takes about 17 hours to charge fully, and last for a week. However, I just keep it on the charger all the time since you can\'t overcharge it.The only thing that I\'m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space.

It promotes positive teeth brushing and even gives you a smiley face after you are done for a job well done. After awhile my teeth feel cleaner and breathe is fresher. I like how it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me to brush my teeth and the travel case is a nice addition too. If you are looking for a toothbrush then look no further this is the one for you.My only grip is how expensive the brushes are I always try and look for specials or deals so I don\'t end up spending to much per a brush head. I also feel the battery life on mine doesn\'t last as long as I would like it to. I think on a full charge the battery light would flash after a week and a half which i feel is a little to short but its not a big deal. Get this toothbrush.

My son wouldn\'t even try the sonicare, and my daughter tried it, but didn\'t like it.  However, my daughter uses the Oral-B every night (She still uses her manual one once a day).  She says she likes the Oral-B.  I bought her some kids replacement heads (I found them on ebay for a really good price).  She likes the smiley face that shows up on the timer after you reach the two minutes.  She even used it longer to see if it would wink at her, which it does.  She watches the timer while I\'m brushing her teeth and I have never had a problem reaching the 2 minute brushing time.The toothbrush comes with a stand and a place to put four toothbrush heads which is nice.  I have two heads in there for me and one for my daughter.  Once I can convince my son to use the toothbrush, there will be space for his toothbrush head.

What I found is that the Vitality has a lot more power -- judged by the vibrations in my head -- plus it\'s even lighter weight, has replaceable heads, and a timer.Lighter weight is good, as are the replaceable heads because that means the whole family can use one base, and you can replace the toothbrush-head after flu or colds.More power should mean that it cleans better.  What I found is that my mouth felt \'cleaner\'... BUT, after I let my teeth \'go\' and get rather \'grotty\' for test reasons, the Vitality didn\'t seem to clean any better in those hard to reach between teeth spots, than it\'s cheaper cousin.  To be honest, I\'m not sure what to make of this observation.  I tried the cheaper cousin after that, plus a standard toothbrush, and nothing worked except floss -- thank heaven -- so perhaps my expectations are too high and no brush would accomplish this task.THE SKINNY:::We will be switching to this Oral B toothbrush and the reason is that I think it\'s more cost effective for us than cheaper Oral B battery operated models that we are currently using.  Though more expensive initially, you can purchase replacement heads so the whole family can use one base.I like the timer.  I thought only the kids would benefit, but to my surprise I wasn\'t brushing long enough either.It doesn\'t remove plague like claimed, but it definitely has more power than our comparison Oral B\'s, and made my mouth feel cleaner.I liked that the brushes were NOT rock hard.

I\'m not a small person either, I\'m 6\'1\' and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  It\'s really not that different than the standard head, it\'s just bigger.  I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  Because of this, getting the brush into every nook and cranny is now more difficult.  Also, because it is bigger, it\'s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.

Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use. Why the three stars and not just one? It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip brush.I have both a Oral-B Triumph and a Sonicare (can\'t remember the model number), and find both to be excellent performers. They are different, and each has its strengths/weaknesses, so I alternate between the two. The one shortcoming neither address well is getting between teeth to get out tea and coffee stains (and the occasional cigarette). For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside. My 6-month dental cleaning/checkup gets rid of them, but by month 4 or 5, they\'re back.Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it\'s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains. The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great. After brushing with either the Triumph or Sonicare, I finish with a 30-60 second run using the Precision Tip. Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth using.For everything else, the Pulsonic is a so-so performer at best. Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I\'ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.If you\'re looking to stop or get rid of in-between teeth stains, get this model and use it in combination with another model. If in-between teeth stains are not an issue, don\'t even bother with this. Pick up a different Oral-B or a Sonicare -- you\'ll be a lot happier with it than the Pulsonic."

Today it costs $60 on amazon while the Oral-B Pulsonic costs $47.  If you are in the market for a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I\'d say either of these would be a good investment.  Both have two settings, except it seems the Oral-B has the \'faster\' setting start first whereas the WaterPik starts a slower speed first.  The Oral-B is slimmer, lighter, easier to hold onto.  Both brushes come with base units but the unit for the Oral-B is smaller and lighter than that of the WaterPik, but it also is easier to push around by accident.  The WaterPik comes with 2 brush heads, the Oral-B, just one.  When recharging the WaterPik blinks and when it stops, you know it has been charged fully, the Oral-B does not.I have not experienced the trouble of the brush head falling off the Oral-B brush, and overall I would say that the Oral-B seems more \'powerful\' in its vibrations.  I can\'t say that\'s a bad thing, but after using the WaterPik for so long, it\'s something one has to get used to.  Overall I\'d say either electric brush is a good investment.  While you get a little more with the WaterPik, it is also a heavier brush and more expensive.  In the end, all they really do is vibrate and you have to move them around.  If I had a choice, I\'d probably choose the Oral-B (which I switched to as soon as I received it), only because it\'s slimmer and lighter and I find it easier to use."

Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but the Pulsonic leaves me a bit unsure.The design of this brush is very reminiscent of the Sonicare toothbrushes, right down to the stand which always looked different on all the previous Oral-B electric brushes. This design really looks like a stripped-down baby version of the Sonicare.First of, the brush itself is extremely slim and light-weight for an electric brush. So much so that one wonders whether it can actually \'do the job\'. So after charging it the required 12 hours, I tried it out for the first time. I did not find it any different in power than the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite, it felt the same.What is different is that the Pulsonic\'s manual instructs the user to move the brush over the teeth in a circular motion, very much like one is supposed to do with a manual brush. I, for one, didn\'t quite like this although I can see the benefit of doing it this way. The Pulsonic has - like the Sonicare and unlike the Oral-B Triumph - a regular (yet contoured) brush head. The shape of such a brush head makes it difficult  to sufficiently cover the entire tooth. One is always either cleaning along the gumline or more towards the bite. Using circular motion prevents that only parts of the teeth are cleaned. Yet - I have been using electric toothbrushes for so long that I have gotten used to not really having to do anything but hold the brush head to the teeth. So this is a change I am not sure I like too much.Also - these rectangular brush heads don\'t seem to work too well for me personally. I have a small mouth and find it difficult to easily brush my teeth with these brush heads, especially the insides of the front teeth. It always feels as if I can\'t quite reach all the surfaces, especially the areas along the gumline, and that leaves me wondering whether I get as complete a cleaning as I should be getting.Philips has tried to address this problem by offering a smaller brush head for the Sonicare, but Oral-B doesn\'t seem to have that. So this is not optimal for me.What I did like about the Pulsonic though is that it comes with a second \'Precision Tip\' brush head. I found this to be a great way to really get into the spaces between teeth and I give Oral-B a big thumbs-up for this one.Lastly, the Pulsonic, like the other models and brands, informs the user audibly when it is time to change to a different \'quadrant\' to be brushed, and when the two minutes recommended brush time are over.All in all this is probably a brush I will take along when travelling - the light weight but equal power output make it perfect for that, but at home I will likely stay with the Oral-B Triumph and its round brush heads. I just feel that these heads reach all areas of my teeth better and also feel more comfortable on the sensitive areas of my mouth."

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $19.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are three of them).

I\'m also concerned that some of the power brushes are too powerful - my teeth get sensitive. After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I\'ve been doing pretty well with the cheap Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary). Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.It\'s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it\'s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn\'t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that\'s it. I think that when the battery dies it\'s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn\'t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don\'t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn\'t a concern for me. I\'m planning to buy this brush for my children to try. For an entry level power brush, this is a solid choice."

It produces a STRONG vibration...VERY strong.  Not for the young child or the sensitive mouth.  I seriously felt like I\'d put a power drill into my mouth!That being said, I\'d have to say it is worth the uncomfortable feeling (which I\'m starting to get used to) -- even after just the first use, my teeth looked shiny and polished, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  And despite the strong vibration, I didn\'t have any issues with my gums bleeding.  I think it just takes some getting used to, especially if, like me, you\'re not used to using a power toothbrush.So I would say that the only downside is that you can\'t control the level of vibration -- it\'s either on or off.  Sometimes it would be nice to turn it down a bit (especially in the morning...though I guess it\'s an effective way to wake up!).  ;-)  Adjustable power levels would make this a 5-star product.  It would also be nice if it had an indicator light that tells you when it\'s fully charged or charging."

I have used at least 40/50 of these over the years. That has happened twice to me. But it\'s fairly easy to open it (you need to pry it open with something sharp enough) and get the floss out.

I visit my dentist every 6 months without fail (yes I have dental insurance and bi-annual cleanings are covered) and I have received nothing but praise from my dentist.I recently switched to this model becauser I became incredibly frustrated with the internal battery models dying 12 to 18 months after purchase. This was not due to mechanical failure as the build quality of this Made in Germany product is solid. However the Ni-Cad batteries cannot sustain charges well after prolonged use. I always disassemble the old brushes, remove the AA battery, and run it through a La Crosse charger using the full charge-discharge cycle which brings the battery back to life. However the disassembly of the brush does not permit for its reconstruction so all I am left with is a rechargeable AA Ni-Cad battery for use in other devices.The great thing about this brush is that it has the same great build quality but costs half the price. Additionally, it takes two AA batteries and the unit goes a week worth of brushing without charging while the internal battery models get 3 days maximum when new which slowly falls to every day before needing charging.In short, you get the same cleaning efficacy at half the cost with extended periods between charges. I am hoping that the product\'s life will also extend beyond 18 months further enhancing the benefits of this model versus any Oral-B/Braun model that can cost 10 times as much!!

I\'m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that \'just came from the dentist\' clean feeling.I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in \'timer\' that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.

I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you\'re done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush, I purchased five heads for the price of 3 of the brand-name ones.The only feature I don\'t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you\'re using too much pressure when you brush.  I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on, I can\'t imagine most people normally brush that hard.

2082,2130,20110626,B002HWS9GG,5,"June 26, 2011",A2KXEYQUT988QQ,Excellent toothbrush!,"This is the best toothbrush I\'ve ever used and my mouth always feel like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist and my teeth have gotten noticeably whiter. It takes a few days to get used to not using the same rigorous back and forth brushing action, but you get used to it. The secret is in the reciprocating action that allows the brush to get between teeth in ways a normal brush cannot. It also cleans those tough back molars extremely well. The included charger is also 110-220v which is a nice feature for someone who travels a lot and lives in Europe like myself. I was also a little apprehensive about the wireless timer/clock, but after using it for awhile it makes a lot of sense and I like using it. I wish they would include an alarm clock or multiple timezones in future iterations to make it more travel friendly and usable. If there were any downside to this toothbrush it would be in it\'s travel \'footprint\'. Although the case is very nice and holds the brush and two heads, its much larger than a regular brush and will take up more space while traveling. The additional wireless timer adds additional packing requirements (which is why I recommend that they add some more features to the clock to make it more usable and travel friendly). If you don\'t travel much, then the size will be fine for your bathroom and the included stand is nice, functional, and compact. Overall, I strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to bring their oral hygiene to the next level. It\'s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but I guarantee your teeth will feel considerably cleaner and look whiter after using it for only a week or two. Great product!"
133,134,20110114,B00006ANDK,5,"January 14, 2011",A3BZSJUIZAIMKT,Good product for sensitive teeth and gums,"Dentist recommended it, I ordered it. Definitely felt the softness difference between this and the regular Oral B brush heads I\'d used for years. Seller was also great -- speedily shipped the product, and shipping was free though the total was less than $20"
1993,2039,20110913,B002HWS9GG,5,"September 13, 2011",A2UZ0JHM10EAH5,Excellent for Braces,"I have braces as an adult and its been fine in every aspect except for brushing my teeth. I was destroying regular brushes and not doing a great job.  A friend suggested the Oral-B and when Amazon had it on sale with the 50% rebate I jumped on it.  To be Honest, this is the best toothbrush I\'ve ever owned.  I have been using the floss head with the braces and my lord does it do a great job! My teeth feel like I just got out of the dentists office, and it gets anything out of my teeth that get stuck due to the braces.  Another huge plus is that its able to get in everywhere with hardly any pressure which is great because I had concerns about bleeding, plaque buildup + getting white streaks on my teeth.  Overall the Oral-B is easy to use, the silly little smiley face lets you know when the 2 minutes are up as well as the brush heads pulsing. I rinse off the unit and remove/rinse the head and keep it in the holder and everything stays nice and neat.  This is one of those gadgets that your unsure of buying, but once you take the plunge you\'re very happy with your purchase because it just works great and is super easy to use."

2643,2707,20101118,B003UKKHB4,5,"November 18, 2010",AONUCJBC85BL,A serious machine for people serious about clean teeth.,"My oldest daughter loves this, she uses it every night. In the mornings she uses her regular toothbrush for quick brushes but at night she spends a good 10 minutes using this. I think it makes her feel both a little more grown up but also she likes taking care of her teeth. Could not be happier with it."

185,189,20091221,B00006ANDQ,5,"December 21, 2009",AQBYXRY06CUMD,AWESOME PRICE!!,"I usually pay $22 for 3 of them in Wal Mart.  I don\'t need to go there anymore, now that I can get them at Amazon."
2027,2075,20110812,B002HWS9GG,5,"August 12, 2011",AV6MTM94X4A1Z,It was love at first brush!,"I\'ve used a Braun electric toothbrush for many years and have always been satisfied with the results. The reviews and the rebate attracted me to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. I especially liked the polishing mode, since I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth. I didn\'t think that I\'d use the clock/timer/sensor, but I decided to put it up to have a small clock in my bathroom. I\'m using it all of the time! I give my teeth a \'spa treatment\' - floss, polish, massage gums...and feel like I\'ve had a professional cleaning. Having always been a diligent brusher, I was surprised to see that I could benefit from the reminder to brush each of the four areas for 30 seconds. The little warning light that tells me when I\'m exerting pressure (and thus brushing too hard - all you have to do is hold the brush up to the surface of the tooth and let it do the cleaning) is useful for breaking a bad habit that seems to crop up in the same place quite often.I even like the smiley face as a reward for good brushing, although I usually tend to be rather jaded about such things. I think that I\'ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. And I\'m also glad for the travel case since I hated to make trips without my Bruan (you just can\'t got back to manual brushing after you\'re brushed this well), but I\'d find that the \'on\' button sometimes got pressed in my luggage and used up the charge. The base for the Oral-B is also small enough to pack easily."

The angle of the bristles makes it very effective, it has the rubber bristles on the outside, and the bristles on the top are perfect for getting the front teeth.  Cheap simple and effective, and an item that makes sense to buy in bulk."
1788,1833,20110620,B002BTETG4,3,"June 20, 2011",A1LJW7GB3HXX7B,Getting used to the size...,"Ok, mind you, I have been a regular Sonicare user for about 8+ years and have been happy with them. Recently, my second one stopped charging. It wasn\'t in my budget to buy a new one right away. My mother works for a dentist and was given the Oral-B Triumph toothbrush that she didn\'t like so she gave it to me to try and that\'s when I bought these replacement heads. I got the bigger head becuase I didn\'t think I\'d like the round one, plus it looked more like the sonicare one I was used to, but it turned out to be quite large, larger than expected. It\'s been a couple months now and I\'ve gotten used to it. My teeth feel clean, just don\'t know if it\'s getting my back teeth as well as a smaller head. I got the 6 pack, so I will continue to use them up then I\'ll think about going back to the Sonicare or order the round heads to try."

2230,2282,20101219,B002HWS9GG,5,"December 19, 2010",A3UEWY6OYOXE1O,Worth the money!,"This was my first electric toothbrush, and I thought I\'d give it a try when amazon had all oral-b for 50% off!  I couldn\'t pass up over a $100 toothbrush for only $50!  It really does make such a difference though.  My teeth have the \'just left the dentist\' clean feeling and I love it!  I haven\'t used all the different cleaning modes, but I have purchased all the different brush heads to see which I like the best.  I\'m very satisfied with my purchase and look forward to brushing my teeth and getting a smiley face when I\'ve completed my 2 minutes! =)  The only con would be that I wish the clock had a light on it so when I\'m brushing late at night or early in the morning without my bathroom light on, I\'d still be able to see the countdown.  But that\'s not really a con, just a feature I\'d like to see added."
1988,2034,20110916,B002HWS9GG,1,"September 16, 2011",AVZMJI27J563Z,Oral B rebate,I am very annoyed with Proctot and Gamble. I waas offered a 50%rebate but did not know what a UPC is and threw away the box so they refused to reconsider the matter. I have all other details and as a non American I did not understand what this is. The supervisor I spoke to was very off hand about the matter so I will not buy any of their products in future.
