If that\'s your brush you can probably go for it.I ordered before brush heads for my ProfessionalCare that fit. Go for the ones called \'Oral B EB17-3\' they fit and work perfectly."
2026,2074,20110815,B002HWS9GG,4,"August 15, 2011",A3LAWFACIX4CLG,very good product,"I have been using OralB electric toothbrushes for years.  My old one was getting long in the tooth(sorry about pun!) and running real slow, so I investigated buying a new one.  Since they were on a 50% rebate sale, i just bought the top of the line 5000 unit.  I could not be more pleased with how clean my teeth end up - I have never had a brush that cleans as well as this one; my hygienist will be so pleased!I would like to expound on the advantages of this unit over the 4000 or 3000 in cleaning ability, but I have no idea, not having used the others.  If the only difference is gimmicks, then this unit is certainly full of them, and you might be just as pleased with a cheaper unit without the unnecessary gimmicks and modes.One big con: there is a mode button to toggle through the 5 different modes that are built into this unit.  Most people, like me, will probably only use one mode, or at least will predominately use one mode.  The mode button is VERY poorly placed, in a very key position.  It is impossible to use this unit without accidentally hitting the mode key on a regular basis, if not every day.  Very annoying to have to figure out how to get back to your preferred mode.  They could not have chosen a poorer location for this if that was the goal.  Its like accidentally hitting the caps lock key on a laptop, for those who do not look at the screen while we type. What were they thinking, if they were thinking at all?  I like good design.  All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an \'F\' for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO. It was just too big a mistake to be an oversight. A smaller con - the outlet plug is a huge unit that sticks straight out from the wall - takes up space and looks stupid - should have been flush.Yet overall, I gave this 4 stars for the great cleaning and the rest of the design and charger."
2495,2553,20120105,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 5, 2012",AD271M80KP69A,Great Brush!,"Simply put, this brush is great.My teeth feel clean after every brush and it stays that way the whole day. Like any other toothbrush, it is easy to use. It last quite awhile before recharge (once a week).With the brush, you use either a daily 2 minute or 3 minute brush. I recommend using the 3 minute brush simply because I can not reach every spot in my mouth in 2 minutes. However, even when using the two minute wash, your mouth will feel cleaner than a 5 minute wash with a manual brush.That\'s all folks."
2533,2592,20120307,B003CP12Q6,5,"March 7, 2012",A1SZM3HKUF7RRY,My New Go-To Toothbrush,"I\'m careful when it comes to my teeth and gums. Finding a great toothbrush can be a chore with the seemingly infinite options. When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions. Let me say I will be sticking with this one. The bristles are firm and \'aggressive\', albeit a gentle aggressive if that makes sense, while soft making it less likely to brush away enamel and/or gums. This was key for me. Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line. The back of the head of the brush serves as a tongue cleaner. It is really a scraper, so it\'s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn\'t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it. I highly recommend this brush!"
2330,2384,20101022,B002HWS9GG,1,"October 22, 2010",A2X8YIMXGM9MGZ,Issues with the battery,"I went through 3 non-working replacement brush handles before I received one that worked.  The replacements were made expediently -- but it was frustrating to find that I needed yet another.  The original did not accept a charge; one of the replacements lasted two weeks before dying completely; another never even started to charge up.  Obviously, the product has a design flaw associated with the battery and recharging system.  When it did work, the toothbrush seemed to do a good job."

282,289,20120114,B00006ANDQ,5,"January 14, 2012",A2YZERYQTLB8NG,Oral B Precision Clean Brush Head,I bought this product last year from Amazon because I was sick of going to the stores and trying to find this particular packet of toothbrush heads.  I like how they really clean my teeth.  My son now uses them and so does my boyfriend.  They really stand up to the everyday use.  I also like that you get 4 in a pack.  You don\'t see that in the stores either.  The stores charge you \'an arm and a leg\' just for one toothbrush head. I would highly recommend this product.
2447,2503,20100220,B002HWS9GG,3,"February 20, 2010",A3DBCYQPMQCBKS,Pretty good toothbrush,"I got this a couple of months ago.  It felt kind of crazy to spend $100+ on a toothbrush, but I had some money in a health spending account to use up. I read a lot of reviews before buying.Pros: My teeth feel very clean after using. It can reach places that a regular toothbrush couldn\'t. The construction feels pretty strong and reliable. I like the external readout, and having a clock in the bathroom is handy.Cons: Expensive.  The feel in the hand is a little big and clunky. All the various speed settings seem a little pointless...probably one or two settings would be fine. The flossing brush head doesn\'t feel like it really flosses/gets between teeth, the polishing brush head doesn\'t seem like it does anything special.  I mostly stick w/ the sensitive brush head.If it lasts me 5 years and results in good checkups, it will have been worth it."
2867,2945,20120317,B003UKM90Q,5,"March 17, 2012",A3GN3OF6YW0IY9,Works great!,Well it\'s an electric brush that cleans your teeth. It works like it is supposed to. It has only one speed which is fine because why do you really want alternate speeds? I cannot think of any negatives about this product.

51,52,20050903,B00006ANDJ,5,"September 3, 2005",A3STME37SSO5MU,This is no Gag,"The toothbrush section an the local drug store has at least a hundred different tooth brushes on offer but in spite of all this variety almost all of these have large heads. If you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex, your teeth suffer. The Oral B head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth, you can. I have not had a cavity in years. My pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed. If only these woked on abs."
1502,1537,20091117,B001CX4JSS,5,"November 17, 2009",AUDJ34B20YECO,Squeaky clean teeth,"(5/03/11) These toothbrushes are still going strong. Great product!I\'ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in it\'s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I\'ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don\'t know what they\'re talking about. I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down. Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.Don\'t hesitate to purchase a Pulsonic. But shop around for replacement heads. I found there\'s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive. However, this Pulsonic has two speeds, and she has found the slower speed to be perfect for her.Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he\'s happy with it too. The size works well with a smaller mouth.Pros-cleans greatlight weightsmall sizeworks for small mouths, i.e. childrenmaneuverablelong battery life (between charge)reasonable priceCons-None so far"
156,159,20100131,B00006ANDK,5,"January 31, 2010",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,"Soft and gentle, effective cleaning","I find this brush to be far more comfortable to use than the standard Oral-B brush head -- no gum irritation at all, but it still gets my teeth feeling clean.  I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head). Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me."

2247,2299,20101203,B002HWS9GG,5,"December 3, 2010",A1X9M76I38PUYF,Just what the doctor ordered!,"My dentist recently suggested that I get one of the Oral-B Professional line toothbrushes, and that, if I could afford it, she really liked the 5000 model that comes with the display screen. I am in love! I never thought I would like a toothbrush as much as I do this one, but it just cleans my teeth so well! I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth from when I had braces, and I also have a couple of bridges that are both such a  pain to keep clean, but not anymore! Great buy! Definitely recommend, especially for people with dental apparatuses!"
2302,2355,20101107,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 7, 2010",A2B7PLSORFIUMR,the best ever,I had an earlier model of the Oral-B and thought that was a fine product.  Recently on an extended trip w/ rough handling of luggage the metal tip was broken off that toothbrush.  Hence my purchase of the \'5000\' model.  Now I have a protective case for travel and a wonderful experience w/ the toothbrush everyone should have.  My dentist agrees.

My wife has had the same experience.  This toothbrush works flawlessly and does an excellent job cleaning all surfaces of my teeth.  I\'ve even noticed that my teeth are less stained (I drink a lot of coffee/tea so this is a plus)."

1527,1563,20120125,B001CX4JSS,5,"January 25, 2012",ATI7Z2ZB93WAP,love this brush!,"I love this brush for several reasons, but the first is its slim, light-weight design and easy-to-use convenience. . its so easy to store between daily uses and carry for traveling.  the battery is powerful too, as each charge lasts 15-18 days.  i had used phillips, \'sonic care\' brand for about 7 years before discovering this little gem.  its so small that i was a little fearful that it would not be as effective, but my last visit to the dentist (1-22-12) for a check-up and cleaning, proved it does an even better job of maintaining good dental health.  it has the normal brush head and a small pointed gum-line brush attachment that is wonderful!  it really gets those hard to reach places...behind, over and under.amazon has it for such a good price, too, that it is real value for your dollar!  i cant recommend it more highly!"
1015,1035,20100206,B000AUIFCA,5,"February 6, 2010",A1QSCUGF2CMWQY,Best On The Market,"The Oral B brush head is the best \'floss action brushing\' tool on the market.  It is a bit \'pricy,\' but the extra cost is worth the benefit one gains by using this brush head."
946,965,20110101,B000AUIFCA,1,"January 1, 2011",A1DQ444QZSSL8,it\'s fake!,"I have used this kind of brushheads for years and the first 2 days I used my new  brushheads that I used ordered worked fine. On the third day it feels very strange when I\'m using it, as if it\'s not really brushing my teeth. I came to check if other buyers have this problem, and I saw some have the suspicion that they are fake brushheads. One reviewer suggests to check this picture with my brushheads, and yes, they look different! The \'Oral B\' is grey on the ones I just purchased, and the blue part of the brushhead is darker!! I have never got a counterfeit item from Amazon before! I really didn\'t think that I need to be worried about whether the product is fake or not on Amazon!"
1422,1454,20120308,B001CX4JSS,5,"March 8, 2012",A3QN28V9G9JIKZ,Great toothbrush!,"This is a GREAT toothbrush.  I decided to try it after my classic Oral B spin brush died (after 6 years!).  It cleans a million times better and has even cleaned coffee stains off leaving my teeth whiter.  It takes a bit of getting used to at first because of the sonic power, but after awhile you won\'t even notice.  Well worth the cost - I definitely recommend this toothbrush."

2584,2643,20110112,B003UKKH6O,4,"January 12, 2011",A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,Really GOOD for the price..........,"Having read some of the reviews for this brush, and then having used it myself, I can\'t help thinking some people have missed the point.This is a rechargeable Oral B, for less than $30 you get -a) It\'s powerful to feel twice as fast as the best named brand that takes AA batteriesb) Small enough to take on your travels with the charging unitc) Built in timer to let you know that you have brushed for two minutes.d) Spare heads although not the cheapest are widely available.So why the criticism??Comparing this to other Oral B models like the 1000 pro series, or 5000 series is like comparing a Ford Focus to BMW, they BOTH drive, and will get you from point A to point B, one is two or three times the price of the other, for the extra money, you get extra features!!Whilst I don\'t like this as much as my Sonic-care, but it\'s a great brush, and for the price worth 4 stars in my opinion."
132,133,20110121,B00006ANDK,5,"January 21, 2011",A2J19UTYODZC9Y,Soft but effective,My gums have receded and I have to be very careful what I brush my teeth with. I was very glad to find these extra-soft brush heads for my Oral-B electric toothbrush. They are much \'kinder\' to my gums than other brush heads.
1278,1309,20110518,B000O8QCB4,5,"May 18, 2011",A2HJ4ZLIKVOLWQ,Elusive to find but will worth it.,I had oral surgery so I have a deep pocket between my teeth where the surgery was done. No toothbrush head except for this one can really get deep down in there. I credit it with keeping the gum healthy at the surgery site and possibly saving my tooth. For about a year now this illusive item disappeared from the store shelves and I was not even able to find it on Amazon. Without it that area just could not stay as healthy. I was thrilled when I found it on here last week. In just a week of use I can feel and see the difference in that area. This is a must have item for anyone with gaps in their teeth or who have a socket problem. I highly recommend it.
2281,2333,20101120,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 20, 2010",A86J42ZP1NJY5,Squeeky Clean,It works great. Takes a little getting used to but after about a week I noticed how much longer my teeth resisted the plaque build up. Also seems to be whitening my teeth a little. Hopefully the next trip to the dentist wont be as painful on my mouth or wallet as previous trips.
247,253,20090713,B00006ANDQ,1,"July 13, 2009",A1R94B2LQ7PBJM,Not the same quality brush heads!,"These brush heads are not the real McCoy! There are two major problems with this product. 1. The brush heads don\'t fit on the tooth brush properly and must be pushed down very hard. 2. The brush head doesn\'t rotate back and forth properly.  It rotates when you turn it on, but the minute you apply pressure against your teeth, the brush head just vibrates vigorously but doesn\'t actually move back and forth like it is supposed to.  I\'ll probably contact Braun, but haven\'t had a moment to do so yet.  Very disappointed."
1820,1865,20120423,B002HWS9FW,5,"April 23, 2012",A2ONQ06NT2WCE6,As good as the $40 rechargeable model,"Comparing to the rechargeable Oral-B model this is as good for a fraction of the price. Use rechargeable AA batteries at 2 for about $5 and it will save you alot of money. The batteries last a long time. Actually longer than the built-in rechargeable Oral-B model. Uses the same exact brush heads so it cleans just as well. For this price, you can get 4 vs 1. Good deal."
2636,2700,20101209,B003UKKHB4,4,"December 9, 2010",A29FOQUE7DCQQC,Pretty cool,System has several settings and it alsolets you know if you are brushing too hard.  Only confusing part is the programs are accessed by pressing the on-off switch and doesn\'t automatically turn off after 2 minutes so you need to tell the 30 second interval notification from the 2 minute notification
3001,3084,20100830,B003UKR67M,5,"August 30, 2010",A12J7R7GAJ5FBZ,Overall a good product,"I have an OralB electric toothbrush at home that I have used for quite sometime. It replaced my manual toothbrush years ago and has been very satisfactory. I do a fair amount of traveling and have been using an inexpensive, grocery store purchased AA battery powered model that has provided fair results.I have been using the vitality in my travels and am very pleased with the results. It has the dual heads that leave my mouth tasting fresh and clean and is far superior to the grocery store offering. To be sure it is much more expensive but the results, to me, are worth the extra cost. In addition to the dual head brush the timer is a nice touch and I have found that while it says the battery requires 16 hours to charge that apparently means to fully charge. I use the Vitality every morning and night during my travels and plug it in when checking into the motel room and find it always has an adequate charge.I agree with other reviewers that a travel case would be very handy as would a light indicating when the unit is charged. I am a bit worried about the battery used by OralB in this product after reading another reviewers comments as to the battery being of old technology and perhaps not as good as AA batteries. I intend to continue to use this unit extensively and will see how the battery performs. If there is a significant failure of some type I will update this review.So, overall I am pleased with this unit and recommend it without reservations except for the battery issue which may or may not be a problem. So far it has been far superior to my grocery store brands."

There may be some misleading information in the pictures. They show \'Oral B\' in Blue as the genuine ones, but mine that came with the brush have the gray \'Oral B\'. These replacements also have the gray, but pass the genuine test.The problem is that this first of the 3-pack falls off the spindle during brushing. It doesn\'t fit tight enough. I inspected the original and this new one and they are alike, so there must be a product quality control problem, as the new one falls off quite easily. It doesn\'t click like the original one."

It is a very thin toothbrush but not uncomfortably so, easy to grasp in your hand.  I noticed immediately when I used it that it seemed to get my teeth cleaner than the sonicare as evidenced by little bits of grime the sonicare had never been able to get, this thing grasped with ease and afterwards my teeth felt a good deal cleaner as well.  The heads for this thing are also cheaper at least, on amazon so I think this thing is a winner."

There are youtube videos that demonstrate hack jobs requiring the user to break the seals and remove solder points and circuit board components, but I don\'t consider that to be a user friendly service by any means. This is a serious design flaw that one might suspect as being intentional (a battery costs about twenty bucks, but Braun/Oral-B would probably rather sell a whole new system for over a hundred bucks). This also makes it difficult to recycle the battery apart from the rest of the plastic and electronics. This is not a green technology and it is obvious that Braun/Oral-B do not care about customers or the environment very much.

Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself.

I hate paying retail for these, but I went back to biting the bullet on price to make sure I bought the real deal. I am happy I did. Make sure you buy the ones made by Oral B. You will like them. I have been using them for at least 4 years and let me tell you, the dental hygenist spends a lot less time in my mouth - and doesn\'t have to scrape and dig around the gumline so much anymore.

The brush itself is much nicer than my old Oral-B 3D...there\'s much more to it and fits your hand perfectly.

The difference was immediate. My first visit to the hygienist after two months use astounded her. She told me she had allowed an hour for my cleaning as the calculus buildup on my teeth had been graded C on my visit 6 months previously. She said it was now an A, and was finished in 20 minutes(No discount). She was impressed that the only difference was an Oral B electric with the floss brush-head. As for the 5000 the difference is noticeable. Much longer battery life. Where the 3D was good for 3 minutes and then needed an hour charge. The 5000 will go at least 5 minutes with full power. Probably more. I got bored and ended my experiment after 5 minutes. I also like the fact it is only high speed with a 30 second pulse. I never saw the need for a slower speed option. The 5000 also has an open charging stand, eliminating the gunk buildup the 3D was prone to, and taking less counter space. As for the clock, I have no idea what it\'s for. Set up is simple. Just plug in the charger and set the brush on. The display will let you know when you\'re ready to go. And best of all you can\'t screw it up. The battery will hold a full charge whether you brush 1 minute or 5. No worries about running it down to achieve full charge like many cell phones.

Like Sonicare, this model is using the \'proximity\' charge method where you place the toothbrush\'s body on the base and charging takes place when the base is plugged into an electric outlet.- Extra brush - this model comes with 2 brushes, one mounted on the body and one extra.- Easy brush replacement - you simply pull the mounted brush to take it out, push the new one in.- $3 coupon to be used when purchasing replacement brush heads.Not so good or annoying:- The packaging is atrocious. It comes in one of those bullet-proof clear plastic enclosures that you must cut with scissors and make sure you don\'t cut yourself in the sharp edges while at it. It took me several minutes to extract the contents off packaging and I did manage to do it scratch-free.- Vibrations are a little too strong - this MIGHT be my Sonicare bias (which I\'ve been using for longer than I can remember) but I felt that this VITALITY was a little too aggressive. My teeth are a little bit sensitive and they didn\'t like that.- A little too noisy for what I am used to - of course, an \'ultrasonic\' toothbrush noise is harder to detect because... it\'s ultrasound.When compared to the higher-end products, it may be worth noting that the VITALITY does not come with a \'full\' timer. The toothbrush does tell you when the 2 minutes are up (noise similar to revving an engine) but it does not turn itself off and, more importantly, it does not give you 30-second signals so you can switch \'quadrants\' as the higher end products do.The VITALITY offers a lot for the price but I am not sure that \'price\' is THAT meaningful when the topic is our teeth. It\'s probably preferable to most manual toothbrushes but, for a few dollars more you can get a lot better. Overall this is a decent product but if I had to replace my higher end toothbrush today, knowing what I know after trying out this product I would NOT go for the VITALITY and sacrifice features and convenience. The few dollars saved would not justify it.Three stars, meaning \'It\'s Okay\' seem to be the fair rating on the Amazon scale."

My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.Since I keep the toothbrush in my bedroom (not enough outlets in the bathroom) I charge it only every other night.

I brush at least 3 times a day, use whitening strips and whitening toothpaste but...I hate flossing!  My teeth are extremely tight and flossing causes bleeding and swelling of my gums.  My dentist has told me that I need to floss regularly since my gums are receding.  This toothbrush a little louder than I expected, but remember this is my first power toothbrush.  I really like the two minute timer feature becuase my dentist always told me that I was always \'over\' brushing.  Since brushing with an up and down movement can wear off the enamel (as told by my dentist), the Oral-B toothbrush uses oscillating and rotating movement which dentists prefer.  The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited warranty.Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.  Gets my teeth clean and seems to do an alright job at cleaning around my gum line.  It does not replace my yearly cleaning by my dentist, but hopefully the dentist will see an improvement with my gums on my next visit."

I didn\'t weigh them, but the Pulsonic is definitely lighter than my Sonicare brush. I also appreciate the fact that the Pulsonic comes with an extra brush head for deep cleaning, along with the standard charger. The basic brush head\'s shape does more for me than the Sonicare\'s as well.The Bad: Unfortunately, I just never felt like the Pulsonic was vibrating/cleaning as hard as my Sonicare. Instead of holding it in place and letting the brush do the work, the Pulsonic requires a fair amount of manual manipulation, during which the brush head can disengage from the main unit.The Verdict: It\'s slicker and cheaper than the competition, but in this case I think you\'re better off spending your money on the deeper cleaning, more reliable Sonicare line."

I had been on a regular gum check and deep cleaning for years, and it is now removed--and the only big change I made was this toothbrush.  It is excellent with the gum cleaning (I alternate between the Floss Action a the Precision Clean heads).  Unlike previous Oral B\'s I\'ve owned, I like that this one does not reset the timer when you turn it off for a few seconds (in order to clear the foam and toothpaste!).  The charger is much smaller than previous Oral B stands. I agree with the previous review about the \'Smart Guide.\'  I didn\'t order this one specifically for the smart guide, but it came with it for only a little more.

The first time I have tried it, it felt a bit unpleasant, but I have gotten used to it very quickly. The best thing about this brush is the bigger brush head as compared to Oral-B Triumph. The brush allows you to use twice as much toothpaste (I have always been concerned that I was not using enough toothpaste with round Oral-B brushes), and it seems that it cleans teeth faster on flat surfaces. Getting into corners requires as much effort as with any other toothbrush.What I did not like: the charger is big and you cannot remove extra brush holders; to turn it off you have to push the power button twice (the first time it switches to sensitive mode); you are supposed to use it in a circular motion, and I tend not to be very good at it. In old days I had problems with traditional toothbrushes as I used to move them up and down and ended up scratching my teeth, so I am afraid this might happen with this brush as well.

This brush is simply light-years beyond the old Oral B 3D! It seems more powerful and even more effective (another plus: this model can use the same brushes [Oral B Precision Clean] as my older model, so leftovers won\'t go to waste. This model also accepts other more specialized Oral B brushes).Many thanks to B. Johnson for pointing out the value of the SmartGuide. For me as well, it serves as a neat little bathroom clock. But the most surprising thing is that by breaking down the recommended two-minute brushing cycle into four groups of 30 seconds each (via a simple but effective circular visual cue), the SmartGuide makes the entire process seem to go by faster. (With old-style brushes, the usual two minutes of unstructured brushing casts you upon a veritable ocean of time. I was always surprised by how long it took for the brush to stutter its two-minute signal. Oftentimes, I just stopped when I felt like it!) You always know (1) exactly where you are in the cycle and (2) when to move on to the next quadrant. This unwittingly clever bit of psychology gives you a sense of making clearly defined progress and ensures that you\'re devoting equal time to all sectors of your mouth. I brush for the full two minutes now, with no sense of impatience. In fact, the experience is so pleasant that I almost always do a final general sweep for another 30 seconds or so.One more interesting detail: perhaps because of its higher speed, this brush seems to prevent water and toothpaste from dripping along the brush shaft. I used to have to put my chin up to minimize this minor annoyance with the old Braun. But after several weeks of using the 5000 (with chin still up but not so extremely), I\'ve not had a single drip.I\'ve always been a faithful tooth-brusher, but ever since I got my first electric brush, brushing has been so much fun that I look forward to it.

A friend gave me this and I\'m actually shocked. Not ONLY could I easily floss my teeth, but within two weeks the inflammation(Known more commonly as gingivitis)was died down to a very manageable point, and within three it was practically completely gone.Crest and their entire line of \'Pro-Health\' items have been absolutely AMAZING for my teeth.

It saves the outer bristles and you still get more than adequate flossing and unbelievable plaque removal. It really extends head life especially if you brush hard, like my wife. Trust me on this; I smoke cigars.NEGATIVES:  Really none..somewhat pricey heads, but more gental than even soft hand brushes."

On my old Braun electric toothbrushes the head rotated and oscillated, on this toothbrush the head pulsates or vibrates.Is it any better? The shape of the toothbrush head seems better designed to fit the shape or your teeth, and it is larger than the old design, large enough to cover two teeth. But while the head is larger in surface area it is much slimmer in profile so it is much more comfortable to use, it feeling much smaller in the mouth. I also like the timer function, it has an overall two minute timer, but it gives a signal every 15 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth.I like this new toothbrush, it seems as efficient as the old style Braun but is much more comfortable to use, and it is a little quieter too. It is also much easier to clean their being no inner workings as on the old style heads, which I am sure must be much more hygienic too.As the toothbrush should run for a week on a single 14 hour charge it is not necessary to replace the toothbrush on the charger after every use, so the charger does not need to be in the bathroom. Using the toothbrush this way should prolong the the life of the rechargeable battery tooHowever, as yet their does not appear to be an Interspace toothbrush head (which I need to reach awkward spaces) available to fit the toothbrush, so at the moment I am using both the old, with the Interespace head, and the new.

Another bonus is that Oral-B redesigned the charging base, making it much easier to clean than previous generations.My only real complaint is that the brush will indicate when 30 seconds has passed by stopping, then restarting suddenly.

Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price. So I asked myself, \'How bad can they be\'?The brush heads I received looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense). When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example. On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth). These brush heads have very poor motion constraint. The circular brush can easily \'slide\' around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).Not only that, but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing. As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \'knock-off\', more interested in looking like the original than acting like it.My advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads.

I\'m sure there are other brands with good products but there are definitely some brands that are inferior.  I can\'t find fault with Oral B.This \'Professional Care 3000\' adds a few bells and whistles (not essential).  \'Hard Brushing\' alert - great idea, many people may not be aware that you should use a very gentle touch and let the brush do the work.  \'3 Brushing modes\' - bah... all you need is \'on/off\'.The timer has always been a great feature just in case you fall asleep and keep brushing far longer than you should.Great toothbrush!"

I couldn\'t believe the deal I got on here!  I saved about half compared to other stores in my area.  If you have sensitive teeth I would highly recommend this model.  Oral-B also makes the 1000 series model.  There\'s nothing wrong with this I am sure, however I believe it doesn\'t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  The only downfall is that about once a week you do have to charge the battery (which does take about 17 hours).  Honestly, that\'s not a big deal.  The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  It has room for additional brush heads.  It\'s a nice feature, but something I really don\'t find the need for.  Overall, those are minor things.  I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains."

At first I thought it was crazy to spend about $120.00 on a toothbrush, but I\'m glad I did. I was probably like alot of you who used the regular toothbrushes that only cost about $3.00 or so.  About a month ago my dentist asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  Told him just a plain jane toothbrush which I switch out every 3 months or so.  He recommended that I purchase an electric one because he\'s a firm believer in them.  He told me what kind he had, which was the Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable made by Oral-B.  He said there are several different price ranges, styles, and brands.  One of the many features I like on mine is the wireless SmartGuide which has a personalizing timer on it.  This helps you brush all four quadrants of your mouth equally. 5 brushing modes- Daily Clean, Sensative, Massage, Whitening, and Deep Clean.  It also has an idicator that lights up when too much pressure is being applied, this is a great feature because I was brushing too hard with my regular toothbrush which caused my gums to bleed.  Since I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 I haven\'t had any problems with it, no bleeding gums, and my teeth feel as though I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  If there is a Con it would be that I had to purchase the precision clean head seperately because it only comes with the floss action and ProWhite heads.  However you also get a 5.00 off coupon to save money on your additional heads you might purchase.  Over all I\'m more than happy with the product and Amazon.com didn\'t waste anytime getting it sent to me.  I hope this helps any possible future buyers. Semper FI"

I am obsessed with using it, for the FULL two minutes because of the just-been-to-the-dentist feel. I opted for the 55000 for the \'gimmicky\' timer which I absolutely love. When I travel I leave the timer at home and I always forget how long I\'ve been brushing. Is that vibrate the 2nd...or 3rd one? I can never remember because I usually try to do something else as I\'m brushing my teeth. So, for me, I love the timer.I love the feel of the 5000 over the 4000 (I bought my mom the 4000 for Christmas and she bought my Dad the same one).I always use the Floss Action head, it\'s by far my favorite.I was hoping this toothbrush would be a little quieter than it is but it\'s not outrageously loud. We have a master en-suite and with the bathroom door closed all the way and the rest of the house silent you can hear the toothbrush in the bedroom but it\'s not loud enough to wake my husband or myself up.I do share the handle of this toothbrush with my husband. Like some other reviewers have mentioned our battery life is not so great anymore. We can \'justbarely\' make it a week without having to recharge. It takes about 8-9 hours to charge fully.My biggest complaint is that within the last few weeks the red light on the timer (pressure sensing light) is almost continually on when we are using the toothbrush. I do need to find the manual and see if there\'s a way for us to calibrate or reset something. The toothbrush is still operating fine but I\'m afraid this issue is a sign of an impending serious malfunction."

You can recharge it once a week, or even once every two weeks, and it\'s fine.  It comes with an elegant recharging stand.  There are a lot of alternative brush heads on the market, such as one for sensitive gums and one for additional whitening power. The one it comes with is top of the line (floss and brush at the same time) and you get two heads in the box.The only downside is that the replacement heads are very expensive.

In fact, the next day I realized some of the white spots on my t-shirt were NOT part of the design, but actually were toothpaste spray from my efforts to capture her on video.

It\'s a great way to get reluctant young tooth-brushers to do at least 2 minutes of brushing because it has a built-in timer, too.
