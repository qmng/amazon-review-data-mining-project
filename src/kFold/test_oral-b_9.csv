1535,1571,20090519,B001CX4JSS,1,"May 19, 2009",A3JWUFZIUYRH5U,Brush Head Won\'t Stay On,I purchased this brush from Target 2 days ago and while I am brushing my teeth the brush head keeps coming off. I then read the reviews here and see that a lot of people have this same problem. I called Oral-B support and they are not aware of any such problem but offered to send me a new brush head in the mail. It would take 2 to 3 weeks to get to me. I am taking this toothbrush back and never buying an oral-b brush again.

It Brushes okay, gives a lot of brushing options, cool little brushing guide monitor- although I hardly use it, & battery life is an improvement. However, it still doesn\'t addup to paying $80 for."
1625,1667,20110930,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 30, 2011",A9WSST6CVKCXZ,"Compact, long lasting charge, works very well","Works great.  Nice and compact overall size, fits well in my travel / shaving kit, plus the Pulsonic tooth brush holds enough charge that I can use it for a week without recharge when I am on the road - no need to have the charger with me which is nice ..one less thing to pack.  This is my second Pulsonic in about two years, and so far (knock on wood) I have not had any cavities and no gum problems."
1204,1231,20110701,B000AUIFCA,2,"July 1, 2011",A1AGFC7WTY81E,Broken brush heads,"I thought each Oral B brush head was supposed to last 3 months.  After about a month, the screws fell out of 2 of the brush heads leaving them useless.  I\'m on the last brush head and was not expecting to have to replenish my supply this early.  Rather disappointed."
1532,1568,20090614,B001CX4JSS,5,"June 14, 2009",A3MTQNFMYZILZX,Great Little Package,I bought this because it was reasonably priced and had all the things i wanted:slim designvarious settings30 second interval timers to tell me when to move2 different brush head sizesoral b brand name for some \'insurance\'Had it for 4 months now and it has whitened my teeth beyond any whitener paste/ gel forms i\'ve ever used. Love how clean my teeth feel. Battery lasts about 3 weeks after a good charge. easy to take on vacation without the base charger.Love it! Definitely recommended.
229,234,20090909,B00006ANDQ,5,"September 9, 2009",A3BBJM5OFNAXJ3,Just what I expected,"This product is pretty straightforward.  They are refill brushes for the Oral B electric toothbrush.  The price was low, and after reading on the internet that this product is frequently pirated (a cheap copy of the original), these turned out to be original with the excellent quality you expect from Oral B."
2397,2453,20100825,B002HWS9GG,5,"August 25, 2010",A13J73ZSJHYQ69,Love it!,"I have used a sonicare for years - I was a little nervous about changing, but, I\'m glad I did.  I love the toothbrush and the brush cover on the stand is a great feature.  The only thing that I had to get use to is that this toothbrush is much LOUDER than my sonicare - I don\'t particularly like that."

2073,2121,20110706,B002HWS9GG,4,"July 6, 2011",A2NHU6BJAFZ825,A Blessing for your teeth!,"This is a great product!  I have waited too long to buy one like this, it works wonderfully. However, the problem I have with it is the directions for using the timer.  It is way too hard to understand, and I am not uneducated!!  I also took this to my neighbor that is a computer whiz and he gave up too!!!I can\'t find a number to call to talk to anyone (no customer service number), So the moral of the story is for the price and the product itself it is great, if you need the timer, forget it and look for another product.If the seller is reading this review I would appreciate an e-mail from you to tell me how to work this timer?The product came very quickly, and well packaged, I am pleased with the seller, I only want some way to contact them, or the manufacturing company about this product.I have read the booklet that came with it and it doesn\'t have a telephone number to call that answers the phone and I have called and called.I really do love the toothbrush though, it makes my teeth feel soooo clean and promotes healty gums too!"
1774,1819,20101001,B002BT9RXE,5,"October 1, 2010",A3PMRWBIOT8NZY,Standard!,Despite the competitively low price the product is very standard - which translates to the best that one could expect.
2908,2988,20111104,B003UKM90Q,5,"November 4, 2011",A1GOBFE12SDGEF,"Cleaner teeth, fresher mouth.",Just about as good as going to the dentist hygenist. Rotary action cleans teeth and easily reaches the back of the mouth and backs of the teeth where you normally don\'t brush very well.
1735,1779,20110704,B001FWXTMS,4,"July 4, 2011",A1Y4GLIPEBDHOB,Great Princess flossers - not so great Toy Story flossers,"Bought these for my daughter after her dentist gave her a pack of the Princess flossers.  They have been perfect for her as she learns how to floss.  The Toy Story flossers, which are half the box were not so great.  The handles were too wide, which made it tough to fit in my daughters mouth to get between hard to reach back teeth.  I wish they sold the Princess flossers separately."
205,209,20091109,B00006ANDQ,1,"November 9, 2009",A197C8V2AZJE3U,Wears out fast!,"Within a couple of weeks these brush heads get more loose than the original head did in a year.  After a few more weeks, the heads flop around so much its hard to see how they stay together.  The packaging and such looks authentic but I can\'t believe it.  They pinch your cheeks when they wobble even when you are very careful.  I\'m going to find a store where they cost more because in this case the deal is not a deal."
3003,3086,20100829,B003UKR67M,5,"August 29, 2010",A1DW1FK1H3F2TM,Excellent!,Excellent and affordable \'power\' toothbrush!

Thanks Oral-B!
504,515,20070104,B0002KHTG6,3,"January 4, 2007",A3O20FMEC78F5V,Effective?,I don\'t know if I\'d say these are effective for polishing.  I received the toothbrush as a dental professional trial and purchased these polishing heads to test them out.  I didn\'t feel it provided anything extra that wasn\'t received from the brushing heads that came with it.
2771,2844,20110627,B003UKM90Q,5,"June 27, 2011",A22PYRB5XZXNWQ,Great Brushing,This seems to be a very powerful brush and much more effective than the previous Oral B brush I had.  I feel like it is really getting my teeth clean in a short time.  I bought it just after having deep cleaning and scaling so I will see if by using this new brush I can avoid having to have deep cleaning at least once a year.
549,562,20090521,B0002KHU3I,5,"May 21, 2009",A1F3SHUKQXVQV,Oral B EB417,"Looked all over for this particular toothbrush head, WalMart, Walgreen\'s, CVS, Rite Aid, several different of each - in different locales, even different states, couldn\'t find it anywhere.  Finally found it here, wasn\'t sure it was the correct fit, IT WAS!  I will be purchasing them again, from Amazon.  THANK YOU"
979,999,20100923,B000AUIFCA,5,"September 23, 2010",A3THPMVBOH0G4M,Clean Teeth,These brush heads work well to get your teeth feeling very clean.  My Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush is getting old now so I am glad to still be able to buy new heads for it.  This 3 pack refill was cheaper on Amazon than if I bought a 6 pack from Costco.
1676,1719,20110104,B001CX4JSS,5,"January 4, 2011",AJ6GXUGTXZTNG,Love it!,"This is my first time to use an electric toothbrush and let me just say I was blown away with the results! My teeth haven\'t felt felt this clean since my regular visits to my dentist! All I can say is, this little gadget has exceeded my expectations and more! And with it the special price I got (and $15 rebate) it has really made my buying experience all the worth while!I have already recommended this product to friends and family!"
1593,1634,20080917,B001CX4JSS,2,"September 17, 2008",A28N2AWOVO2PB,Oh where is my Philips Sonicare???,"You want a mouth massage? Well, this is the toothbrush for you. You want some serious cleaning? You need Philips Sonicare.There are good things of this toothbrush, but I think the disappointing things outweigh them. For one thing, the brush\'s head is larger than the Sonicare\'s. This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.The one positive thing is the toothbrush\'s compactness. It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior. But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare."
2111,2161,20110424,B002HWS9GG,3,"April 24, 2011",A1VUN4JU731CBH,Tedious Timer,"Having had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and liking it, I was looking to get another Oral B when the time came to replace it. I decided on this model because it had the separate timer - something I had come to really miss on my older model. It had the timer on the handle only, making it impossible to check during operation. And while it buzzed after each 30-second segment was up, I often didn\'t really remember whether it had already buzzed to signal that the full two minutes had been reached and kept brushing longer than that.But it turned out that the separate timer on the Oral-B 5000 is all around tedious to operate. First, one has to remove the timer stand, then the battery cover because the buttons to set the timer are hidden underneath the cover. Whether this was a misguided attempt at keeping the design minimalist I don\'t know. But having to fumble with this already didn\'t work for me - I can\'t help but wonder: What were they thinking?In the end, the timer never worked anyway - it is set to demo mode when one takes it out of the box, and the buttons in the battery compartment also serve to set it up for regular operation. Trouble was that my timer could not be reset to normal operation. It kept cycling through demo mode time and again until I gave up and returned the whole thing.As to the toothbrush itself, it seemed to work great, just as I was used to from the previous model (and the only reason I gave this 3 stars at all). But since I had gotten this particular one because of the timer, I decided to order the 4000 model instead and just put up with the timer in the handle - at least I know this will work.One last word: My old Oral-B toothbrush came with a nice, very sturdy fabric case. This one in contrast has a rather flimsy plastic travel case. Another disappointment. My conclusion: Too expensive for what it offers."
2008,2056,20110903,B002HWS9GG,4,"September 3, 2011",A2Z9YXF9CRQUC8,"Very good product, but pricy","I have been using this tooth brush for almost 3 months, and I really like it. My teeth have never been more cleaner. It\'s expensive, though.  I found the wireless SmartGuide not that useful, so I recommend SmartSeries 4000 or 3000 if you want to save a few bucks."

1353,1384,20120101,B001CSZTFK,5,"January 1, 2012",A3UY5R2UZXC3B6,Oral-B Pulsonic Replacement toothbrush head,"It is very difficult, nearly impossible, finding replacement toothbrush heads for the Oral-B Pulsonic electric toothbrush in most stores such as CVS. This vendor provided a couple of sets of four at reasonable price, and provided the sets quickly."
2592,2653,20100925,B003UKKH6O,5,"September 25, 2010",A3L2KYOYDWSRPL,great product,works great and gives a very clean feeling. Does not cause any gum bleeding like some other high frequency power brushes do.
1943,1988,20111116,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 16, 2011",A22UBBNRIPV1J6,Best Power Brush I\'ve ever used!,"Bought this 6 months ago and my oral hygiene has improved significantly! I have been a Sonicare users for years but I never liked it, finally my dentist recommended this brush to me and I am now in love. I also converted my husband to be an Oral B user as well!"
1022,1044,20091203,B000AUIFCA,5,"December 3, 2009",A6ESRQTQ1UK27,GREAT !! Toothbrush heads if you buy them from the right source. BUYER BEWARE see written review,"You will love this electric toothbrush head with its dual action clean!!! Your teeth feel as smooth as the day you get them cleaned by the dental hygienist!!!~*This is the second time I have contacted this seller about the defective toothbrush heads I received. I have done some research on Amazon about the toothbrush heads I ordered from them and there is a \'buyer beware\' site that identify\'s fraudulant oral b tooth brush heads. They show pictures of the true oral b tooth brush heads compared to the \'look alikes\' that are sold to unknowing customers like me. I compared my toothbrush heads to the pictures online and have discovered they are not true oral b brand toothbrush heads but, rather falsely advirtized as such.~*Make sure before you buy toothbrush heads to compare their product to the real thing, they may be selling a look alike."
2006,2054,20110903,B002HWS9GG,5,"September 3, 2011",A66QC2WLC5G48,Much better handle than previous generations,"I have been using Braun 3D Excel for over 5 years now. The handle broke a few months ago and I switched to a regular non-electric toothbrush, waiting for a good deal on electric toothbrushes. Found the Oral-B 50% mail-in-rebate offer and bought the SmartSeries 5000 from Amazon. It was delivered yesterday. It came with the 5000 handle, wireless display, charger, 2 FlossAction brush heads and a storage unit for brush heads.I was using the same Oral-B FlossAction brushheads with the 3D Excel, and I think the real technology is in the brushheads, so I was skeptical of the value from the 5000 handle. But when I brushed with it this morning I was really surprised by how much better this handle is from the 3D Excel. I also realized why I have been using electric toothbrushes; manual toothbrushes do not even come close. It felt like I went to the dentist. Absolutely worth the $50 I paid (after mail in rebate) including shipping. I still think the wireless display (Smart Guide) is a marketing gimmick, but I may be proven wrong over the next several weeks of use.I have not used the 3000, 4000 series or the Sonicare, but I would definitely recommend this over the 3D Excel handle and definitely over manual toothbrushes."
228,233,20090912,B00006ANDQ,1,"September 12, 2009",A1GAPTVZ6IDQ39,Works great when they work.,I bought two eight packs an 6 out of the pack broke within one month use. The old ones worked great. Not sure what happened but if you scan the internet you will find this is a major issue with these.
2282,2334,20101120,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 20, 2010",A1UDES1MFHOCFA,Amazed!,"After having some dental work done, I decided to break down and buy an electric toothbrush over a traditional one.  For less than a week I did have some gum sensitivity like they mention, but after that the pain and problems went away.  I\'m amazed at how much cleaner my mouth feels and looks.  My teeth whitened a little bit at first and the overall health of my mouth improved greatly.  I will never switch back to a traditional toothbrush, even though it\'s costlier for this one and the refills.  I figure I\'ll save much more than that in the long run and just the way my mouth feels now makes it worth the cost.  The box comes with everything you\'ll need.  It had two brush heads included, a traveling case and an okay looking case for the brush heads (I still prefer to keep them in my medicine cabinet).  I definitely recommend this product, it\'s worth every penny!"
2833,2908,20101015,B003UKM90Q,4,"October 15, 2010",A20J4FB33G3X4X,Works well,"I like Oral B electric toothbrushes - I\'ve been using one for several years (that was much more expensive), and this one works just as well.  Considering the fact that it\'s priced much more reasonably, I\'d say it\'s a very good product for the price.  Makes buying a good electric toothbrush much more accessible!"
2197,2247,20110120,B002HWS9GG,5,"January 20, 2011",A1UEPDBZLGAYWX,Wow,"First off, I didn\'t buy this from Amazon. I used a 20% off coupon and bought it for $112 plus tax at Bed Bath and Beyond where they still have the 50% off rebates! So this will end up costing me $56!Anyway, I have had the Crest Sprinbrush, ya know the cheapo ones? Anyway I hated it and went to a manual. But my dentist recommended that I go electric, suggesting the Phillips Sonicare. They had plenty of MIRs and coupons. Yeah ok. Real surprise huh? I wanted something that spun to get more plaque off and clean better. I believe the Sonicare works well but you can get the Sonic attachment for the Oral-B also. After one day of using this, I am blown away. Why did I wait for this before? I feel so clean after one use. Much better than manual.I was using my iPhone app, Brushytime to time and make sure that I brush long enough but it turns out that I do that anyway. The smart guide is cool but I have left my teeth get away from me and I will take all the help I can get.I will not be buying my replacement heads from Amazon because of all the fake ones being delivered as of late."
1394,1426,20100312,B001CSZTFK,5,"March 12, 2010",ABIMHU444XGHM,Pulsonic Toothbrush Refill,Wonderful product.  Too bad the smaller toothbrushes aren\'t included in equal number in the refill package.
2574,2633,20100816,B003EN42OK,2,"August 16, 2010",AFMMOBD0XVBMR,Oral B replacement brushes,This product seems to to a bit flimsy. The bristles are very soft. The brush does not \'snap\' onto handle to make a secure connection. Not as robust as brands that I purchesed in the past.

2360,2415,20101002,B002HWS9GG,5,"October 2, 2010",A277KHX8TFTC58,Fantastic,"I\'ve gotta say, this Oral-B Smart Series 5000 electric toothbrush is incredible.  I was skeptical because I have been using its direct competitor for about a year, the top-of-the-line Sonicare Flexcare HX6950 with UV Sanitizer, and was very happy with that brush.  A friend of mine has the Oral-B smart series, and when I saw it, I knew I had to give it a try to see what all the hype was about.  I found the opportunity when my father asked me to order him one, so I threw in an extra one for myself.  It arrived in two days from Amazon, brand spanking new.I\'ve used the Orab-B for about a week, 14 times, and I have to say its different than the Sonicare, not necessarily better, but just different, and just as good.  The Oral-B gives you a different kind of clean, and I definitely feel my teeth and gums get a really, really good cleaning after brushing.  My teeth also seem whiter now.  I think the Oral-B removes more plaque off my teeth, and more food from between my teeth due to the optional Floss Action brush head I\'ve been using.  Don\'t be fooled, there is no substitution for flossing, but this brush head does a little for you, especially if you have bigger natural gaps between your teeth, of which I don\'t, so I have to floss.  The Floss Action brush head is really amazing, quite an innovation, and I love it.The wireless SmartGuide is pretty clever too.  It automatically goes on when you turn your toothbrush on.  I can definitely say, that the SmartGuide helps you to brush longer and more thoroughly.  Its almost like a trainer when your brushing, rooting for you to finish 30 seconds on each setting.  I do one cycle for the top teeth, and one cycle for the bottom teeth.  The SmartGuide is very helpful to anyone, no matter your age.  The four different stages of this electric toothbrush are also very helpful, I use them all, and always will.The Oral-B Smart Series 5000 comes with one Floss Action brush head, and one Pro White brush head.  I also ordered a 4 pack of sensitive brush heads, but haven\'t used them yet.  In addition, after seeing how much I like the Floss Action brush head, I ordered more of those, a 3 pack actually.  If your wondering about the price, forget about it, its totally worth it, and will probably save you thousands of dollars worth of needless dental work due to cavities.  I can\'t recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush enough.  In fact, if you have the money, be generous and buy them for other people that can\'t afford one.  Everyone should be able to use one of these, they are that beneficial to oral hygiene.  I can\'t imagine using a regular toothbrush after using an electric one, especially an electric on of this quality.As usual, Amazon is amazing for price, shipping, product quality, and customer service, literally the best store on the planet.  I don\'t even understand how other stores can stay in business with Amazon in existence.  I stopped keeping track of how much money I\'ve spent here in the past 10 years..lol."

Set up was very easy and I was brushing my teeth within 5 minutes.  I like the timer that tells you when to switch to the next part of the mouth.  The brush can sit on the charger and stay charged all the time.  Takes up very little space on the counter.

This toothbrush is excellent and gets my teeth cleaner that any other that I have owned. The head rotates faster than my previous brushes. I would definitely buy this product again.

The timer is fun to use and my teeth have never felt so clean.  I love that it\'s incredibly fast and lets me know when I\'m brushing too hard.  It\'s expensive, but it was worth spending all my Goodie Drawers from work on. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I have never gushed about a toothbrush before, but this one is amazing."
2283,2335,20101119,B002HWS9GG,5,"November 19, 2010",A2L8TPYU6U1AKT,Oral-B 5000: the best toothbrush ever made,"This is the best thing you can do for your teeth.  I got it when Oral-B had the 50% rebate promo running, and Amazon was selling it for just $99.99.  So getting it for $50 was a steal of a deal.It cleans perfectly and I have noticed whiter teeth in just a few weeks of use.  I will never go back to normal manual brushes and can\'t believe I hadn\'t bought this earlier!  My teeth honestly look and feel healthier than ever and like they all say, it does feel like i just stepped out of the dentist\'s office.  Buy it, it\'ll save you wonders on dental bills and all but ensure you won\'t have teeth problems, gingivitis, etc.  I use the \'sensitive\' mode to brush my tongue as well, and the \'massage\' mode helps strengthen your gums and feels good too.  The extra brush head that\'s included is awesome, and the display helps you see how long you\'ve been brushing, what mode you\'re on, and also functions as an extra bathroom clock :)All in all, very satisfied with this purchase.  My family uses it too with their own separate brush heads (you only need one handle).  The charge lasts about a week with use.  It leaves my teeth spotless and it\'ll do the same for you!"

In the past many of these cost me up to $60-$70 for the toothbrush motor/handle and charging assembly.  It seems they have gone down in price, but also in quality.  The handle is definitely not as hefty and the motor seems weaker.  However the price is very nice for basically the same effect."

It comes with an adhesive backer so you can stick it to your mirror (or wherever you brush your chompers). I used be the person who brushed for maybe 30 seconds. But with the timer, you can\'t help but feel like crap for quitting early. It tells you how long you\'ve been brushing, the battery level, if you\'re brushing too hard, which zone you should be brushing, and what mode you\'re in. AWESOME! The battery lasts for about a week, but if you\'re on a longer trip you can take the charge out of the base (it\'s tiny) and pack it with you. There are tons of different brush heads and different brush modes, depending on what you\'re trying to accomplish. I got this toothbrush last September and have had two dentist cleanings since then.

I find that most soft brushes don\'t do enough in removing grit and tartar from my teeth. So, when I tried this, I was about to give it away or throw it in the trash. But, then I did a double-take and ran my tongue across my teeth and looked at them carefully in the mirror. And, whaddyah know? It got every little speckle off of my teeth. It made them feel polished like I had just got out of the dentist. This is the first gentle toothbrush that I\'ve used that actually works well.

Put simply, his orthodontist bills will be horrendous. And while he still hates to brush his teeth, I can feel confident that the dental bills won\'t outstrip the orthodontist. The two-minute timer is especially helpful for everyone, as Son knows when he\'s done and I can listen for the toothbrush to signal rather than digging up yet another destroyed kitchen timer. The action on the toothbrush head is much better than what he can do himself, though I have no idea whether it actually removes any staining (he\'s a little young for coffee and red wine issues).The price is very reasonable (particularly considering the cost of some other rechargeable toothbrushes) and the cost for the head replacements is not bad either.

That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that\'s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it\'s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you\'ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It\'s not like they\'ll go stale in the linen closet.Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.Hints:Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you\'re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you\'re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you\'ll do a serious \'eewwww.\'  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.  This is important.Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger. This will make that weekend maintenance simpler.That\'s it! Now get one for yourself and see."

The pulsonic has a light that just shows when it\'s charging.  The pubsonic has a larger brush head but this brush gives a deeper clean, which is also somewhat of a downside due to the noise that\'s produced by the power behind the brush.

Upon receiving the product, it did not look anything like the original brush heads that I received with the toothbrush I bought months ago from Amazon. The primary differences were: the bristles were the wrong color(the center green was a darker translucent color instead of the opaque light green), the bristles were splayed out instead of in tight clusters, and the gray logo was much lighter. I chalked this up to maybe changes in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the first brush head I tried did not work at all. I chalked that up to manufacturing defect. The second one worked, but didn\'t quite feel right. I decided to just go with it however, and after a month the brush head became very loose. I saw the other reviews and photos and realized that I had received fake product directly from Amazon.Here is the worst part. I decided to purchase replacement heads from Walgreens retail store. I got home and realized that they were also fake product. So, then I went to Target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine. I was floored to find fake product in a retail chain store as well as at Amazon.So, TLDR buyer beware of fake product when ordering online or shopping at retail. Look at the brush heads carefully before you make your purchase. It seems like there is a major counterfeiting problem right now and it hopefully gets resolved soon."

The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth.  The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design.

As I could not find more details from other reviews (maybe I missed) based on how I plan to use it. I\'ll focus the review on that front. I thought the SmartGuide is very helpful as the kids can clearly see the progress and stay on the brushing until 2 min. is reached. I\'m glad to report that it works as planned perfectly. As an adult, it is easier to manage the discipline on how long you should brush your teeth. However, my kids constantly want to get off the process and it is painful to calm them down and persuade them to go further. With the SmartGuide clearly showing the progress and how far you are away from the \'smiling face\', it helps managing the expectation excellently.Now get the details on how the SmartGuide works for our use. Each 5000 comes with one SmartGuide, and you can use just one for more than one toothbrushes. However, the manual also provides you instructions on how to make each SmartBuide dedicate to individual toothbrush if it is what you desired. I bought two together, and found that both SmartGuide will respond to signal coming from each toothbrush as the way I received them. Since I don\'t want to put two SmartGuides in one bathroom, I don\'t need to reconfigure anything.The SmartGuide function is very simple. It automatically receive the signal from the 5000 toothbrush as you start brushing. If you stop in the middle, the time counting will pause then resume when you continue. If you wait longer, (not sure exact, maybe 30 sec or longer), it will reset itself. Everything is automatic, there is no manual button to start or stop time counting, therefore it can not be a timer for anything else besides 5000. For the extra SmartGuide that I do not plan to put in the same bathroom with the toothbrushes, I use it as a clock in the other bathroom; it looks nice though.I don\'t have much to say on other fronts. Overall, it is an excellent purchase for young children.Charlie"

Having tried multiple rotary style brushes and battery-operated pulse brushes, I was a bit wary on the switch to a Sonic/pulse brush since she was quite fond of her former brush.Summary (per the wife)- Size...perfect for smaller hands/mouths, but very useful for getting to those hard to reach areas. Better portability; however, because of the small diameter of the base, it doesn\'t stand upright that well (but too big to fit in any toothbrush holder slots)- Charging Base...takes up a very small footprint on sink- Price...much lower than many newer Oral-B/Sonic-care brushes- Performance...cleans extremely well, takes a week or so to get used to it.I did try it out for a day or so, too (don\'t tell the wifey!!!) and was quite pleased by the pulsing sensation and the way it made my teeth feel/look. I liked it so much, that I decided to get one for mom, too!!!"

I bought mine a little over a year ago and immediately fell in love with it. It works wonderfully, it cleans your teeth amazingly. My teeth have been whiter and strong since I started using it. The replacement heads aren\'t too expensiuve either. I get my 3 packs here on Amazon for $13 and you only have to replace them every 2 months I\'d say - but you could wait longer and it still works fine. It even tells you when it\'s time to replace by starting with blue bristles that slowly turn to white as it\'s used. It has a timer on it so you brush your teeth for the full recommended time. When your done it shows a smiley face. It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want. It doesn\'t hurt your teeth and does a great job, you don\'t even have to press it to your teeth. If your looking to buy one - buy this one. It\'s so great I even bought myself a second one for when I travel. :)"

It reuses the old heads (so it lets us leverage our existing investment in heads), but is WAY better.  It seems to spin faster and more powerfully; basically, we\'re sure that it cleans better.  There\'s a visible difference.There are some neat features as well.  It beeps to let you know when you can finish brushing a quadrant of your mouth (like the Sonicare), and a bright red light goes off when you push too hard.  Brushing too hard can wear away the gums, damage that can be very difficult & expensive to repair... if it is repairable.  (Unfortunately, we have a lot of personal experience with overagressive brushing.)We\'ve also tried the Sonicare in the past, and found the Oral-B to be superior.  The Sonicare didn\'t really do a good job of cleaning our teeth.  There are some parts, esp behind the front teeth, that Sonicare doesn\'t really do a good job of reaching.  The round head of the Oral-b allows us to reach everywhere.  After switching from the Sonicare to the Vitality, my periodontist told me she saw an improvement.

I\'m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  When you have teeth that are not straight like I do the back sides of your teeth are very hard to reach and the smaller round head on the brush I find reaches the hard to get areas better than the longer rectangular brushes.  Doesn\'t straighten your teeth though.  Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I\'m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  I tend to think that is glamor over substance.  After all the brush is just rotating in an oscillating motion purre and simple.  It works and works well.  My model hesistates at the end of two minutes and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  You still need to floss and thats expected.  I have been very pleased with my last unit.  I didn\'t save the box and the model number isn\'t on it so I cant say which one it is.  I\'ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  Good product and will continue to use till new technology comes up with something better.

While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.ADVANTAGES:Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It\'s not the most powerful brush I\'ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.DISADVANTAGES:Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it\'s nice to have the option and this one does not.Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it\'s power would rate 3 stars.OTHER COMMENTS:Does it whiten teeth?  It\'s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.  I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me."

I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.While I have no complaints about its power, the fact that it utilizes two cleaning brushes gives it a much larger brushing surface than with the single brush found on my Soniccare.  While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist."

Aside from pinching parts of your mouth in the loosened gap, they will eventually disintegrate in your mouth.

The electronic display, and the various cleaning modes are something the Sonicare does not have and I find the modes useful.  I do not like the brush head with this unit.

I have been using the dual clean head with the Viality but this model came with the floss head and I really like it.  My teeth feel really clean afterwards and noticed less plaque build up when I rub my tongue along my teeth at the end of the day.  I did not think I would use the wireless timer and if I could of removed it from the order I would of.  But since it came in the box I did set it up and gave it a try.  I found I have been brushing longer with the timer which could be why my teeth feel cleaner after using the deep clean mode and targeting all quadrants.

And, there is no sense in repeating all of the great things in all of the excellent in-depth reviews on this Oral-B Toothbrush.Con:  THE WIRELESS SMART GUIDE\'S CLOCK CAN ONLY BE SET AT 12:00.Response:  The wireless smart guide clock can be set to either 12 or 24 hour a day clock.And, I love having the clock sitting on my bathroom counter top to help me keep track  of my morning schedule.Con:  YOU REALLY DON\'T NEED THIS PART AS IT ONLY TELLS YOU WHEN  THE RECOMMENDED TIME OF 2 MINUTES IS DONE.Response:  As is stated above, it is also a very accurate clock and can also keep track of the 45 second brushing cycles.  I like this feature.  Also, if you tend to brush too firmly a little red light flashes on the LCD screen and the pulsation of the brush stops.Con:  You\'ll also receive a timer that reminds you when to move to a different quadrant of your mouth; a useless gimmick for an adult, in my opinion.Response:  I am an adult and I still love this feature.  It is very easy not to brush your teeth long enough especially if you are in a hurry.  The timer doesn\'t allow this to happen.Now, some extra PROs:Previously I was a diehard Philips Sonicare user for many years.  But, I was having some problems with my gums and deep plaque buildup.  I finally decided that there must be something better and more effective.  After much research online and with my dentist\'s input, I decided on the Oral-B.  I absolutely love the deep cleaning feature and brush head.  Actually, I never use any other head or brushing strength other than the deep cleaning mode and brush head.  The brush head has numerous styles of bristles that accomplish different things from deep cleaning, removing plaque, cleaning between teeth, massaging gums, etc.  You couldn\'t give me my Philips Sonicare back.My original hesitance was the price.  But, it was worth the money considering I only have one set of teeth and gums.One minor CON:  The user manual was not written to be user friendly.  It does a poor job of explaining how to set the Smart Guide Clock features.  Just be prepared to read it carefully and keep it nearby for a few days.  When you consider all of the awesome features, the user manual is not worth losing a start or a half star."
1594,1635,20080914,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 14, 2008",AUCIFMWP3DU8R,\'The Circular Motion: Rub It.\',"Thanks, Frank.Upon acquiring this device I wondered if it would soon join the collection of previous failed attempts at \'better and easier oral hygiene through technology\' currently growing mold under the bathroom sink.So far so good. It is too early to evaluate the long-term benefits promised by this product, but I find it a very simple and practical design, easy to store, clean and use. It is slim in the hand and very lightweight, most of my earlier experiments were thick and bulky, and cumbersome to navigate around the mouth. Like brushing your teeth with a flashlight.The Oral-B has a good feel to it, natural and well-balanced, and that makes me more likely to pick it up instead of a \'manual\' brush. The brush itself is rather petite, but this makes getting into tight areas a little easier. The noise was startling at first, a shrill buzz that reminded me of another reason I never took to electrics: it shatters the quiet ritual of morning and evening brushing.But if it works, it will be worth it. I  have so far found the single biggest complaint is that my usual rather aggressive style of use needs to be restrained, or the brush head will twist off of the body. It\'s a � turn quick release, and this is great for cleaning and sanitizing, but it seems to pop off in the mouth rather easily. How the bristles survive until I learn a gentler touch remains to be seen. I have to remember it\'s like running a polishing tool, not a backhoe.The unit is totally sealed and waterproof, as is the charger-base. Makes clean-up a cinch, and with induction charging connection, no pesky exposed electrical connections. Pretty much standard these days, I would expect. Another small but obvious feature that you\'d only notice if it was not there: the motor shuts off upon return to the base, like hanging up a phone.It has two speeds, \'normal\' and \'sensitive\'. I find normal is probably better to use, it tickles quite a but but it is not too hard to get used to. I use the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant. I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits. A double-blip signals the end of the session, as does a mouthful of hyper-foamed toothpaste. Try not to drool, OK?"

After I had been using it a year the Dental Hygienist remarked, \'I have to hunt to find things to do in your mouth\'...so I started getting my teeth cleaned once every 2 years.

I really like the Oral-B because it has a small rechargeable base therefore the power of the toothbrush is consistent (unlike replacement battery units).  These replacement brush heads were a great value.  I like the \'dual clean\' since it has the revolving round bristles (on top) and the bristles that move up and down (on the bottom).  These brush heads make my teeth feel so clean that I feel like I just left the dentist office.  I particularly like that the blue bristles fade through time reminding you that it\'s time to replace the brush head (they last around 2-3 months depending on how often you brush).  No regrets buying these on-line - very competitive pricing (in fact far cheaper than retail stores) and shipping was fast.
1598,1639,20080904,B001CX4JSS,5,"September 4, 2008",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,The new aesthetically pleasing brush,"Before I received the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush I was using the conventional, bulky, sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare).  Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  The Pulsonic is about the same size as a manual toothbrush, which is much smaller than all electronic toothbrushes currently on the market.  This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom (even the charger is not the usual eyesore).  Now to the nitty gritty, what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  Nothing, except unwanted complexities.  The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren\'t familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  This takes the place of the usual multi-button brush with a variety of settings, only one of which you actually wind up using.  The Pulsonic comes with one standard brush head and one precision head that has a brush area about the size of a toothpick and stiffer bristles.  The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  This is designed to help you spend the right amount of time in the four quadrants of your mouth, and has always seemed silly to me, but after using it for a while I am following the routine without even thinking.  The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very \'natural,\' and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter. Overall, the brush does everything a sonic brush should, none of the things I think it shouldn\'t and it takes up less space and looks great.  The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  If you\'re looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B."

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for four Flexisoft EB17 heads for $24.99 (The EB17-4 just means there are four of them).

It was REALLY hard to reach my back teeth.  (I\'m a medium sized woman, so not sure why those brush heads always seemed so big to me.) But this is a great toothbrush!  The head is perfectly sized to get around all my teeth and all the way to the back of my mouth with no problems.  The stick part is slim too, so I don\'t feel like I\'m cramming in something too big.  I love the 30 second quadrant timer (although you really have to pay attention for the pause or you\'ll miss it).  It is also completely waterproof, as I use mine in the shower (not sure if you\'re supposed to do that but I do with no problems so far).  And it has some serious power to clean!

I know most people don\'t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn\'t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!Ok now for the research details:1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it\'s time to brush on another side.6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you9. It\'s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn\'t like to brush or doesn\'t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. It guides you so you know you are getting a great cleaning. Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it! So as you can tell I love it and I am very satisfied with my purchase! Good luck and hope it works amazing for you as it does for me and my family!"

This center also extends the life of the bristles by protecting the pressure/ breaking down during agressive brushing.  I smoke cigars, and after 2 weeks, the plaque is gone.

Unfortunately the competitive price of this product did not make up for the poor quality and unsafety of it. During brushing, small pieces of metal came out of the toothbrush heads and shot into the gums and lips, sometimes causing lacerations. After this, the round brushing part of the head would come loose itself.After 3 of the toothbrush heads did this, I contacted the seller by email and then by phone and explained the problem to them. They apologized and explained that this was a generic product from a chinese manufacturer and although they had never run into this/any problem with their products before, they would send me a replacement (oral B original) product. I agreed.Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, as I began to use these \'original oral B\' toothbrush heads, the same problem has recurred with pieces of metal shooting out of the rotating toothbrush head during brushing and hitting the gums and lips. I\'ve been using oral B electric toothbrushes for a few years and have never seen anything like this. I\'m not exactly sure if this second set I have received are really oral B products or not.My point is that low price apparently means poor quality, at least in the case of this seller."

In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.This Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more toothpaste.What I do like:>>  The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all.  Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  Trust me on this.>>  The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.>>  I love the rubber grip handle.  My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.>>  Will go over a week between charges.  I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging.>>  Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.What I do NOT like:>>  No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.>>  The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I\'ve ever encountered.  My knife gouged into the rubber hand grip and I nearly cut myself twice.  If you have the option of choosing this with frustration-free packaging, get that one instead.I hate visiting my dentist.

We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist\'s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn\'t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn\'t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don\'t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn\'t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth."

These toothbrushes also feature  electronics that keep the motor voltage constant - and hence maintain optimal orbital brushing speed - even as the battery voltage declines as they discharge. So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops. So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries! This feature also means despite the lower voltage of using 2x 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, you get the same brushing speed and power as using 2x 1.5V Alkaline cells. This is great! as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.Build quality of the units is great as you\'d expect for a Braun, even for a cheaper unit. The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section. This guarantees moisture vapour can\'t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term service.The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can\'t get into the internals.The 2-minute timer is a nice feature. At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you\'ve been brushing but if you wan\'t to keep brushing, you can as it doesnt turn the motor off.Overall this brush is great, especially for the price. The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific. The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber. All these problems are remedied with this Braun model."

I don\'t know if newer Sonicare toothbrushes have a different design. I used the Sonicare Elite for many years until the nickel-cadmium battery died. I didn\'t notice the inferior design of the Sonicare until I started using the Oral-B 5000. The Sonicare has fat plastic at the brush end which is not as comfortable as the slim Oral-B brush head. The Sonicare has a fat and elaborate interface between the base and the removable brushing unit, which is not as easy to keep clean as the slim and simple interface of the Oral-B. And the Oral-B brushing part of the two types of brush included in the box does a better cleaning job. Finally, we have battery disposal. The Sonicare has a non-removable Ni-Cad battery, so that in order to dispose of it properly at a recycling center I had to cut the base to access the battery. The Oral-B has a provision for removing the nickel-metal hydride battery (better than Ni-Cad), although the manufacturer wants you to stop using the unit when the battery dies, not to replace it."

Prior reviewers have already commented on the power converter that sticks 3 inches out from the electrical wall plug - duh. Also the enigma of how to open the battery compartment of the \'Smart Guide Display unit\'. (TWO covers to be removed with gorilla fingers, sliding each in opposite directions.)Fortunately the rechargeable (Ni-MH) battery in the handle can be replaced (compared to the older Braun models that became useless once the battery died), but how to change the battery is a deeper mystery. (Amidst the very poorly written instructions, the section for replacing the rechargeable battery provides only a small diagram that is utterly unintelligible.) I went to the [...] website and clicked on \'email us\', but what a bad joke that was - I just ended in an endless search option in their FAQ section. Next I\'ll call them at [...].Oh, then you have to remember twice a year to not use the battery charger, so that the battery discharges completely in order to \'maintain the maximum capacity of the rechargeable body\'. (Since a full charge is claimed to last at least 10 days, I suppose one then turns on the toothbrush and leaves it running on the bathroom counter... hoping the internal moving parts don\'t wear out in the process.)CRITICAL: In these days of airline security concerns, if you bring the toothbrush with you (as my dentist recommends), DON\'T FORGET to deactivate the radio transmitter that is built into the toothbrush handle (to communicate with the \'Smart Guide display unit\').In summary: This is a fabulous toothbrush (10x better than my previous Braun model) but a disaster on the \'user friendliness\' scale.

It gets every speck of plaque off of my teeth, even in the hard to reach areas.  Unlike an old powered toothbrush I once had, it doesn\'t require a special toothpaste, and can use your favorite kind.  Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  I\'m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time. (You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about oral hygiene.)The toothbrush comes with a sealed plastic charger, which will charge the brush overnight.  A full charge will give you a week\'s worth of brushing. (14 x 2 minutes) This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.

Ths brush is relatively inexpensive, but it also feels inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.Pros:-It works. The product came out of the package, charged, and worked without a fuss. The worst part of setup was the anti-theft plastic package.-Inductive charging base. The case is 100% waterproof sealed, and power is drawn by setting the brush on a holder base so that power is transferred with no risk of electric shock. Very nice.-The brush pulses a couple of times to let you know when you\'ve done your time. Brilliant.-And it comes with an extra basic brush head.Cons:-Rattles your head like a jackhammer, negating most of the positives the moment it touches your teeth. The motor is relatively slow and cheap, so until you\'ve used it for a while and learned to adapt you\'ll be concerned that it\'s going to knock your teeth out before you\'re done cleaning them.-Standard brush head is only okay. You get the most basic brush head out of the box, which to me feels only so-so for cleaning. I sometimes have to run my brush for an extra cycle to feel really clean.Overall, if you want to try a power brush but you don\'t have the money for a more expensive model, this isn\'t a bad choice- it\'s still better than a manual brush. However, in the realm of power toothbrushes, you can and should do better. When you weigh a lifetime of painful dental cleanings and potential surgical issues from cavities against the (hopefully) one-time investment in a good power brush, there\'s really no reason to stick with an underpowered model like this that\'s going to rattle your teeth like it does.However, I\'m still going to be reusing this model for a long time to come- craft and cleaning experts know that there\'s nothing like a cheap power toothbrush for doing tasks like detail cleaning leather. For this application, this is an absolute wonder of a brush. It\'s cheap, and all the jackhammering works just fine when it\'s done on something other than your head."

These heads cover more brushing surface area and last longer than other heads.  In fact, they\'ve been lasting twice longer than my other heads in my experience.  Therefore, I will keep buying these Dual heads."

This product does the job so well, that I think my Dentist is a little perplexed, as I \'have less tarter, than most women my age\'. It\'s funny, she is always pushing another brand. If this brand is doing so well, why would I switch! I love the auto ship option that I now have with Amazon!"

I would seat in the dental chair and get my teeth scrapped for hour to hours which I HATE.  I bought this toothbrush back in December of 2009. I like the timmer which shows me if I am cheating and if I am using to much pressure.  The best part was I went to a dentist on March 24 after using the brush for about 3.5 month. The dentist told me I had very little tartar and my teeth were the best this month out of his patients.  My teeth were scrapped for less then 5 minutes compared to a hour due to this toothbrush. I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH BECAUSE OF IT. It\'s well worth the money consider I don\'t have to go back the dentist in 3 months but 6 months. Thank you Oral-B.

2380,2436,20100925,B002HWS9GG,5,"September 25, 2010",A2J9767WL816PH,So glad I listened to my Periodontist!,"For over 5 years I\'d been using the Sonicare toothbrush thinking I was doing a great job on my teeth and gums.  I\'ve always had severe gum problems and have had many gum grafts.  Until it dawned on me that I\'m still having gum problems so I switched to a new Periodontist who informed me that the Sonicare was tearing up all my gum grafts that were done.  He highly recommended the Oral B.  So I switched and what a huge difference.  It goes around the tooth which is what their instruments do at the dentist.  After using it for a almost 3 months, I can see a huge difference!  My gums and teeth feel clean but not all tore up.  I can\'t wait to go back to the Periodontist and show him the difference in my whole mouth.  The ORal B 5000 has a little digital clock that shows you when you\'re brushing too hard which has made a big difference in the way I brush and a 30 second timer to show you when to switch quadrants.  I\'ve always thought that really scrubbing my teeth was the way to go but not so! This brush shows you how to do it right.  I\'m excited about my new findings as I\'m spent so much time, money and pain in improving my gums. I feel for the first time, I\'m getting it right!"

(There are 2 brush heads included int he box.)  I don\'t really like to use it to brush my tongue so I still keep my old toothbrush on hand for that purpose.  The unit has never run out of power on us and works today just as well as it did we we received it.  If you don\'t care for the large dual clean brush heads (they are a little big) you can use any of the other heads that Oral-B manufactures.
816,833,20110929,B0002M5JO8,5,"September 29, 2011",A2WGJMRE7ICJZ6,Great price!,These are just as advertised and for a great price and with free delivery.  It is much cheaper than at Target or Walmart.  Just a complete win-win!
151,154,20100609,B00006ANDK,4,"June 9, 2010",A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX,"Gentle, but wish it was recyclable, like Preserve","I am a huge fan of powered toothbrushes - my mouth just doesn\'t feel as clean when I use a manual toothbrush. I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that\'s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference! I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads. They feel softer on my gums and so I think they are a gentler choice. I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth. I have been using these heads for almost 10 years and often get compliments at the dentist. Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums. Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best. I\'m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn\'t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth & gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.I do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect. I\'ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months. I find that the blue begins to fade after one month. I think I\'m an average brusher (twice or more daily) and I even have two toothbrushes I switch between (depending on which is charged & what bathroom I\'m in), so I would think that the indicator would last longer.This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE! Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (& recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual. (If you\'re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve. They sell plates, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, razors, etc. & I do really like their razors) I know that plastic recycling isn\'t the best thing for the environment, but it\'s gotta be better than throwing all these heads in the trash/dump/ocean... I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they\'re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.) But, I can only keep so many. Anyway, that\'s why I give this product 4 stars, instead of 5. Gentle, but wish they were recycled & recyclable.Many thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)"

Yes, it is still going strong after four years: it replaced a system I bought from the dentist office that crapped out after a year. The replacement heads are widely available, if you don\'t mind paying $23 for a pack of four - WHICH I DO MIND VERY MUCH. These were $10 for four and I\'m a happy camper."

What a disappointment!  Shoddy construction -- the brush part twists off so easily that it came off twice while I was using it, and it vibrates your hand more than in your mouth.  It also lacks a brush cover, something I was used to with the Sonicare.  Seems more sanitary to cover the bristles of a toothbrush that lives in the bathroom, right?I am returning the Pulsonic tomorrow.  I may just keep my old faithful Sonicare, which may be homely but has worked great for about 7 years."

After persisting, using these regularly in conjunction with the Oral B round soft head I have to say the Pro White heads have continued to be a disappointment. Good brushing and flossing leaves my teeth feeling more polished.  I won\'t be buying these again. Save your money and stick with the brush heads that work."

But to my delight, I found these replacement brushes. So now my toothbrush is still working as well as it did when I first bought it! I also like it that the set includes the tiny brush for cleaning between teeth too! I would say this is a little pricey at $20, which averages out to about $5 per brush, but it was worth it to have them so I wouldn\'t have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush--and a brush, I might add, that is my all-time favorite, especially since it has the \'sensitive\' teeth speed.
