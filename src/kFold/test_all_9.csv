I got it online for second time and both times I am disappointed. I will not recommend anyone to buy razors online. These are all duplicate Gillette or second rated products. Good for only 1-2 shaves and then you get bad feeling after shaves. The original Gillette product last longer and are probably good for 12+ shaves (never counted).Always buy this product from good store. Saving money is good but at your skin\'s cost.There are some expensive Gillette products on Amazon... not sure if they are same or different.

It\'s my first sonic brush and my teeth were a wee bit sensitive at first, but I got over it.The Pulsonic replacement brushes are more affordable than most, which was one of the factors into my purchase decision. In addition, it runs SO long on a battery charge, it\'s just amazing. The 30 second timer to move to another quadrant to brush is a nice feature. Not to mention the mail-in rebate that was available when I purchased - now expired but check the Oral-B website to see if there is anything new.I still miss my Interplak with rotary head that lasted me 15 years before the battery couldn\'t hold a charge anymore & brushes were near impossible to find.

I\'ve also got the Gillette Fusion 5-blade shaver, and I definitely prefer 3 blades, especially for travel.  Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.    "

I switched to a safety razor for facial shaving more years ago than I care to remember and I have yet to find a disposable or replaceable or for that matter rechargeable (and I have tried quite a few) that comes anywhere close to equaling the resultant closeness of cut or smoothness particularly when those infuriating independent gray hairs that crop up under the chin are considered. However, I am not as adept in avoiding a sling blade result on the back of my head with a safety razor so I am constantly in the market to identify a disposable or replaceable that fills the bill.To that end, the ProGlide is acceptable but I still had to make several passes on the back of my head to get a smooth, minimally stubby result, not unlike the outcomes with a Mach 3 or Schick 3... or one of the five rechargeables currently residing in one bathroom or another. Interesting enough, I also got better results on my head with the back side trimmer single blade than the front side five blade shredder.  I didn\'t feel any discomfort like pulling or tugging or experience any inadvertent nicks. Actually, I was mildly surprised that it had cut as close as it did since it felt like it was not cutting at all which I suppose is somewhat of an endorsement.However, with the ongoing cost of replacement cartridges, for my needs there are far too many less expensive, equally beneficial alternatives.

Those were the two top reasons why I purchased this product.  I knew I wanted to purchase an Oral-B.  I ordered the Oral-B 5000 Sunday 9-20, it was shipped 9-21 and I recieved it 9-25.  The order came from TeethNthings.  The product was packed ok but I received it banged up.  The postal worker wanted to blame it on poor packaging but it was packaged fine.  The product itself was fine.I have been using this product for a couple of days now so I must report that I am overall very happy and satisfied with it.  I read over the instructions twice, and when I used it for the first time, I was puzzled when I felt it doing small pauses.  The instructions are ok.  They could have broken it down dummy-style for some of us but oh well.  I was a bit confused about how to set the timing part, but I figured it out.  It could have been the excitement.If you buy this product, it will do these short pulses every two minutes.  After two minutes of brushing, the smiley comes up and winks.  So cute.  If you reach 4 minutes of brushing, it will do the pulse thing again.  There is a DVD that comes with it to explain their brushing technique of using the brush.  They break it down in 4 quadrants, 30 second intervals, two get in at least 2 minutes of brushing.The toothbrush itself is a tad bit noisier and heavier than my old ancient basic one, but let me tell you, boy does it go.  I feel like my teeth are getting a serious dental treatment, Spa Dente\'.  I don\'t know what this toothbrush will leave for the dentist to do, besides exrays.  To switch between the different brushing styles, you will push the triangle button while the brush is on.  The detached screen thing will tell you.  I use it in sensitive mode.  If you are brushing too hard, it will flash red.  Be careful not to push it while brushing, as it would seem easy to do.I really really love how they have the charger.  It is small and not bulky, which is perfect for travel.  Pretty smart how they did that.  The charger base is your travel base as well.  I really really love the blue travel case that it comes with so you can store two brush heads.  That is so neat.The best thing about this toothbrush is that it really gets your teeth, gums and mouth clean.  The smell of my breath has improved also.  It does a wonderful job.  I am very very pleased and would recommend this toothbrush to anyone.  It is a little expensive but it is well worth it to me.  I hope if you purchase this you will enjoy it as"

I had intended to order this same brush head, but the reviews on the Floss Action brush head refill intrigued me. I won\'t have definitive results until I go back for my scheduled cleaning, but the size of the head is very compatible with my smaller-sized mouth. I like the thought that I might be getting a better cleaning between the teeth, which is an area of concern to my hygienist. Stay tuned!"

I wore the tip out within a few weeks. The only replacement heads for this toothbrush have three regular brushes and only a single precision tip. I searched high and low for just replacement precision tips - nothing on line. Called Oral-B they told me to get a head that does not work with this vibrating toothbrush. When I called them back they apologetically agreed that there was no other way to get additional precision tips without getting three regular toothbrush heads - a complete waste.So if you want to get this toothbrush because of the extra precision head to take care of your gums - look elsewhere.

Wasn\'t the LCD display on the brush itself good enough? The wireless display is a joke in my opinion considering it is not even back-lit. Secondly, the battery is HORRIBLE for this brush. It takes minimum 14-16 hours to re-charge it and it doesn\'t even last for more than 3 days. I had a sonicare toothbrush before and battery lasted for 15 days and got charged within 6 hours. The dual-action head is so BIG that a normal person can\'t even fit the brush in his mouth. I would expect lot more things if I am paying this much for just a toothbrush."

This razor works just as well as they do. They glide smoothly over my skin, and leave my legs feeling soft. The only thing they seem to have changed is the razor holder, and I do NOT like it.The old razors came with a large holder that sticks to the shower wall and opens up to hold two spare razor heads. This new holder is MUCH smaller and suctions to the wall. You just slide the neck of the razor into the holder, and that\'s it. I\'m not sure why they changed this. I would think wall space in the shower isn\'t really something most people are trying save, and now, your spare razor heads have to be kept outside of the shower. To some this may not be a big deal, but I ALWAYS change to a new razor head while I\'m in the shower.Overall, I still love the razor and the job it does, but the new holder design is, IMO, no good. I ended up throwing it out and using the one I already had. I really like having the two extra blades in the shower with me so I can change it right when I need to.    "

[...].  I\'ve never used Turbo and I\'m not sure what it would add to my shaving successes, so I figured I didn\'t want to pay more for this feature.Amazon had the best price I could find on the regular Mach3, but when I received them I must say they look different than I remember.  They seem to be made of cheap black plastic, I could swear the ones I bought in retail stores felt better made.  I dropped my razor in the shower recently and the metal tabs that hold the whole thing together bent and tweaked the cartridge -- this had never happened in years of dropping store-bought Mach3s.  And it might be my imagination but it seems like I am needing to change blades more frequently, as if the blade is a poorer grade metal that dulls or corrodes faster.I can\'t prove it but I suspect Gillette is trying to phase out this product to steer consumers to a more expensive update, and is manufacturing a cheaper version for guys like me who cling to this product in hopes of avoiding the more expensive update, but the spotty quality will probably push me there eventually anyway.

1210,790,816,20060923,B000BUW8WM,5,"September 23, 2006",A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,Best shaver I\'ve ever had.,"I\'m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.    "

So I opted for this new Oral-B, and what a pleasant surprise!The coffee stains on the backside of my teeth that the Sonicare couldn\'t get, are disappearing w/this toothbrush.

Of course, upon examination of my rear molars she\'d wax philosophical about those who properly brush for the full two minutes, and follow the listerine-floss-brush system every single day.  Finally, I gave in.  Mostly because I lost my dental insuranc. I figured I should step up my home cleaning to make up for missing a routine cleaning or two.Now for the technical:The setup was completely intuitive.  It came with a multi-page english/spanish instruction booklet, which being human, I did not read.It has three modes of cleaning, I really only use the one.  Every 30 seconds it makes a little pulsation, which allows you to time how long you clean each toothy-hemisphere.  (30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right) This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.

Those are shaped more like a conventional toothbrush, rectangular,rather than round like this unit.  I always thought the Cross Action did a good enough job so I never splurged on a more expensive unit.  Well, after trying the Oral-b 3000, I find I like the 3000 much better.  I have less of a tendency to \'brush\' my teeth with the 3000, and I know you aren\'t supposed to brush with an electric toothbrush, just move the brush around slowly.  Being smaller in head size, it is easier to maneuver and I feel it does a better job getting  to all the teeth surfaces.  I love the added bonus of the 30 second timer on  the 3000.  At first I thought something was wrong when every 30 seconds it would seem like the toothbrush was powering down, but it just is a timer to let you know to move on.  It has a 2 minute timer so you can focus on doing 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  How fun is that!  The red \'too much pressure\' light is also handy, and I had to push pretty hard to get to light up, such that is was uncomfortable on my teeth.  Some of you may need the warning light, but the pain was enough for me to stop the pressure.  I do like this toothbrush, but I also agree that it is costly and buying replacement heads are costly, so it is a continuing investment.  Still, these clean so much better than manual toothbrushes.  My kids have been using them for years and between the two of them they have had 1 cavity.  So perhaps these do pay for themselves in the long run."

The Mach III is the first time I felt like I could shave rather absent-mindedly (it is first thing in the morning, after all) and not endanger my face.The issue is that the Mach III has been surpassed by the so-called \'Mach III Turbo\' product release from Gillette.  The naming of that product is unfortunate - \'Turbo\' sounds like some marketing affectation, when in fact it honestly provides you with a vastly superior shaving experience.  Despite the rather obscene price point of the Turbo, I\'d suggest you skip the \'Mach III\' and move up.  I\'m convinced you can get more shaves out of it and make your money back.  Plus, it\'s just a better shave.   "

I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I\'m lucky enough to have a window and sill.For that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don\'t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life. And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all. The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical. But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again. I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).In my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months. Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don\'t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B."

First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  However, once you power it on, the vibration allows it to glide smoothly over your body.  When I shave with my normal razors I always get pin hole knicks all over my body (about 8-15) and come out of the shower bleeding. With this razor, I only had one knick--simply amazing. Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.I also had my boyfriend try it and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily but he could get use to that.

They were superb in performance gliding easy on my skin. They lasted for almost 12 months; yes, one full year. Encouraged from this experience I ordered these cartridges[ASIN:B004B8AZH0 Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, 12-Count] from Amazon. In fact, I subscribed to receive a supply every six months. These new blades do not shave the way the ealier ones did. There is no comparison. These ones do not glide smoothly, I need to pull the razor and it makes scraping sound! As if I am sharpening a razor on a leather belt! The quality of shave is not at all close and clean and it irritates the skin. I was so much impressed with earlier Gillette experience that I did not contact Amazon immediately and kept trying different blades.... even after 3 or 4 different cartridges still no luck.The mineral oil is missing in the strip. Very poor experience....and I have now decided to return the unused cattridges and cancel my subsciption for future supply.Update : 01/04/2012My earlier experience was with Fusion Proglide! And, this review covers Fusion. There is noticeable difference in experience from Fusion and Fusion proglide. I can not understand why Gillette should have very similar nomneclature for two different products which led to this confusion. My repeat experience with Fusion Proglide blades is excellent.    "

I found the razor actually gave a better shave than my previous Gillette provided.The new Proglide is smooth and did the job without punishing my face.  I can shave in the shower without a mirror and the razor glides gently over my face without missing a spot or nicking my skin. If there is one downside to using Gillette Fusion razors it would be the high cost of replacement blades. I suppose one must pay the price for quality and inovation.The new Fusion has a feature that my previous one didn\'t.  The on/off switch is lighted.  OK, that is no big deal, but I really appreciate it because my nearsighted eyes can easily locate the switch to turn off the razor.I recommend buying the Gillette Fusion Proglide even if you already have a previous model of the Fusion.

No it\'s not thin.  It isn\'t supposed to be.The pad is a GREAT 15\' LONG.  Offering more protection where the flow goes which is toward our buttocks than any other on the market.  I for one am tired of connecting two pads to get any semblance of protection.  Even light flow doesn\'t go straight down, not if you have thighs which meet.  Some of you are complaining that its too big, well there are plenty more petite pads on the market if you indeed need a smaller pad but for those with a heavy flow and for women above a size 14 who have a big booty we need to APPLAUD THIS PAD for finally arriving for us.  I don\'t know why the industry didn\'t realize a century ago that you shouldn\'t be trying to make pads the same dimension when women range from 4\'9\' to 6\'7\'.  A 6-7\' long pad doesn\'t even protect the most direct fluid route if you\'re a larger lady. Lying down, flow goes awry even more so and for a pad to actually deserve the title OVERNIGHT it needs to come with a nice old old fashioned belting system (just a little strip folks) and truly be more like 22\' inches long.  We need a pad to reach from tummy to back of your waist if it is to prevent all staining and allow us to go to sleep without worry.  These pads don\'t do that and I wish they did.I still say manufacturers have no idea what a heavy flow is but I\'m afraid these are as good as its gets when it come to holding a lot blood. Good for postpartum.  If you have adenomyosis, fibroids, endometriosis, are in peri-menopause or GOD FORBID ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS, I\'m afraid even this pad will need frequent changing.  Do Diapers work as an alternative?  The answer is \'not so well\' as they are made of textiles meant to absorb a dilute fluid not a thick fluid.  Until Proctor and Gamble gets it right the natural green brand of diapers- TUSHIES in its largest size helps some with overnight woes.  If you are a tiny woman you might even be able to actually get one on completely, unwieldy to use (nothing to hold them on).  Alas they are kind to sensitive skin.Back to these pads...For comfort no one ever beats ALWAYS.  They have made the best \'tops\', the surface that touches your skin, for over 2 decades.  In other words they feel great and do stay dry.  These don\'t have the texture of their new Infinity line but instead have that sort of plastic lace top Always came out with back in the late 70s early 80s. I wish that they applied the Infinity odor control and material to THIS SIZE.  Layer the INFINITY textile over this pad.  That combination of materials I think would be a SMASH HIT!  Listen to MEEEE P&G.A word about those darned wings.  All they do is channel moisture toward your groin and hold it there against your skin to make you chafe.  They never stay in place.  They don\'t spare your pretty panties anything.  Take them away!  I tuck them under [or scissor them off].This pad has an adhesive strip protector sheet on top, and another on its back. I welcome that.  When was the last time you saw a women wash her hands BEFORE entering a stall?  You\'re handling a pad with your paws covered with every bacteria from elevator buttons, escalator rails, filthy knobs, currency, tickets, and other person\'s hands and then putting all those bad particles there.  That TOP protective sheet lets you get the pad on without transferring all that mayhem to your groin. That area needs to be handled as sterile-y (is that a word?) as you handle your eyes but no one seems to ever say that.  I wish pads were marked STERILE and were indeed that pristine.INCONTINENCE, these are useless for that purpose.  Add Always Max Protection Dri Liners.  They are as thin as a sheet of paper.  And as teeny as they are (really short) they do hold liquid and boost the performance of any pad they are added to.  Their adhesive is strong, stronger even than on these full size pads. They do not come with any kind of wrapper.I\'m switching back to Always from Natracare.  Went there to avoid chemicals and because there was a sort of quiet underground buzz abut Always is just not being sterile enough in their manufacturing and indeed causing infections but with heavy use Natracare\'s SUPER is irritating and their Nighttime Extra Long is woefully not up to par but if you want less of a pad than these they just might be right for you.  I\'m hoping P&G is making these in at least a CLEAN environment despite the fact that you never see the term STERILE in a sanitary product description.  I think it ought to be there especially for tampons.I DO RECOMMEND THESE FOR HEAVIER FLOW DAYS but unless your body is neater than mine you\'ll still stain sheets until manufacturers really bring the pad to waist.  That\'s just the simple unattractive truth of the matter.Finally the pads are WHITE, my flash may be making them look pink or purple.SOAP dot com with their great 15-20% off coupons and Amazon are running neck and neck on price.For Natracare the best price I\'ve found is at Lucky Vitamin  The Nighttime Extra Long was $3.45 for 10."

After using this razor several times the results were that I always felt or could see hair the next day or two days later.  That leads me to believe that with 5 blades, it\'s still not a close shave.I also felt the razor head was surrounded on all four sides with way too much plastic; making the shaving of more delicate areas, bikini line, etc, a little more challenging.  I felt I was doing some serious contorting in the shower this morning, and felt if I could have removed some of the bulky plastic, I would have been much better off.I did like the shower case that suctioned to the shower wall, I liked that a lot.  I also enjoyed the fact that I didn\'t have any razor burn or bumps.All in all I just don\'t think it\'s worth the hype.

I am able to eat with relative abandon again (after getting braces) once I learned how to use the SmartSeries 5000 properly and in a systematic way.The SmartSeries 5000 (with an ortho brush head and power tip attachment) has made brushing and cleaning with braces on extremely easy and a no-brainer.The kit includes a handy travel case (with holders for two attachments), lightweight charger, and timer which links wirelessly to the toothbrush.I usually start with the power tip which is very effective in cleaning debris around brackets and between the wires.  To clean with the ortho brush head, simply press it in front of each tooth and count slowly to twelve -- going from the rear molars to the front teeth on each side on both top and bottom rows of teeth. After that, just brush the biting surfaces and rear of the teeth.Overall, the kit components were very useful to me except for the timer.The timer would display a ring which represented the top and bottom rows of teeth.  The ring was split into four sections and the timer would indicate the amount of time needed for each quadrant of teeth.  It was somewhat tricky to clean by the quadrant and just easier for me to use a fixed count for each tooth."

Getting the back teeth is tricky for him, and when we take over to \'do finishing touches,\' we\'d always end up bonking him on the teeth/ gums/ lips with part of this toothbrush. This made him mad, and when you are trying to convince a toddler that toothbrushing is fun, you do not want to make him mad.2. The brush head is not replaceable. So once the bristles are worn, you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one. Sure, the purchase price is cheap, but like so many things, that is not the \'real cost,\' once you factor in how many you\'ll have to buy and how many you put in the landfill.

YES.The advertised thinner blades do make a difference: these is less drag and effort applied when I shave with my Fusion Power blade handle (you don\'t need to buy the new Fusion Proglide Power shaver to use these new blades). I find the shave to be much more comfortable and enjoyable with these new Proglide blades than with the Fusion Power ones I\'ve been using for the past 2 years.Is there a significant difference between the Proglide Manual and Power cartridges? Not that I can tell and not enough for me to fork over the extra money for them. The battery-powered handle makes the difference in the shave in my opinion.Another reviewer mentioned that blade maintenance makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE in the longevity of your blades, and that is true. Always clean your blades with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol after each shave to remove the mineral deposits left by your sink water.    "

The last 10 years I had used the Bump Fighter disposables and lately the Bic 2 blade disposables. They were OK, but you have to really look closely at your face in good light to see that spots were missed, especially the chin. They don\'t flex and adjust to the surface of your face. If you\'re careful and take your time, you can get a pretty close shave with them, but when you are rushing in the morning to get your family out the door - on time for school and work - quick is the word.I opened a free sample that Gillette had sent me some 3 years ago, tried it, and fell in love. It was the best shave - no irritation - even against the grain, which I never did with the other systems for fear of razor bumps. I was truly impressed!Now I\'m looking for a good bargain on refills. After reading some of these critical but helpful reviews, I will definitely buy from a store. I really like them even if they are pricey. Going to have to work this cost thing out.

Ni-Cad batteries are notoriously memory prone and don\'t really last long at all. In fact, the instructions for this unit state not to leave the charger/stand plugged in unless the unit is ready to be charged up. This is because if you charge it when it isn\'t fully drained, the battery will not last as long on subsequent charges due to the memory issue. Oral-b should be ashamed of themselves for incorporating such a lame battery in what could be a more useful product with a better internal battery.Luckily, I have an old Oral-b power toothbrush that takes regular AA batteries and the brushes from this unit fit on it! So, when the stupid ni-cad battery on this unit fails, I can use my old base and regular AA batteries but still use the dual head brush attachment.I can\'t recommend anyone buy this based on the fact that the battery is not viable.

I\'m not a small person either, I\'m 6\'1\' and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  It\'s really not that different than the standard head, it\'s just bigger.  I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  Because of this, getting the brush into every nook and cranny is now more difficult.  Also, because it is bigger, it\'s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.

I remember the first ads when double blades started showing up.  The idea, according to the advertisers, was simple: the first blade would pull the hair so that the second blade could cut it closer to the skin, something that to me defied all logic.  I didn\'t have to worry about it for a long, however, as after a while I switched to depilatories.About a year ago I decided to switch back to shaving and went to buy a razor.  To my dismay, pretty much every model had four blades. What in blazes did anyone need all those blades for?  The heads of these razors were huge.  And why stop at 4?  Why not 6, or 8?  All I wanted was a simple double-bladed razor.  No luck.  I ended up getting the Gillette Venus with three blades and I\'ve been quite happy with it.  Seems someone at Gillette, however, thought that more would be better, or at least more profitable, so when I saw this new red five-headed beast offered through Amazon Vine, I thought I\'d give it a try and see if it was all just marketing hype.  I mean, what the hec? You can always use another razor around the house, right?.  To tell the truth though, I wasn\'t really expecting to like it.  I figured it would be bulky and awkward and just not worth the extra cost of the replacement cartridges.Turns out that this is quite a nice razor in spite of the extra size of the cartridge, which is definitely larger than the three-bladed ones.  First of all, I should point out that all Venus razors accept all Venus cartridges.  I was able to swap cartridges just fine between the new Embrace and my old Venus Divine.  It doesn\'t matter whether you bought a plain Venus, a Venus Divine or a Venus Embrace razor.  You can use any of the replacement cartridges with any of the razors.  The biggest difference between the cartridges is not the number of blades, but the amount of lubrication, as I discovered when I accidentally ordered plain Venus replacement cartridges instead of Venus Divine cartridges.To test out this new razor, I compared it to my old Venus razor with a new plain Venus cartridge, using the new razor on one side of my body and the old one on the other.  Much to my surprise, there was a huge difference in effectiveness as well as comfort between the two, with the Embrace cartridge coming up with much more hair.  Also, the lubrication seemed to smooth over the rough edges of any dull blades.  When you have this many blades, some of them are bound to be dull, but at a cost of about three bucks a pop, you don\'t want to have to throw one out.Okay, this is way too long a review for a stupid razor.  In short, both the Divine and the Embrace are great, better than plain Venus cartridges.  If you already have another Venus razor, though, there\'s no need to buy a new one.  Just get a pack of replacement cartridges.Oh, and by the way -- the blade holder thingy fell off my tile in less than 10 seconds and only holds two replacement cartridges anyway.  Gillette should scrap these things, which are just going to end up in landfills.    "

Do not buy!,"I happen to suffer from three things that my wife described until 5 years ago a hughe problem; 1) Extremely sensitive skin, 2) Very (and I men VERY) thick facial folicules, and 3) Keloid cicatrization.I solved my problems through trial and error (which means many cuts and sores!) and different blades and gel trials, I went from shick, wilkison blades, remignton, braun (Electrical) to gillette. And I came to always the same results, cut, burn, soring, irritation, razor burn, you name it I had it, and you can guess, many scars, which made the opperation of shaving worse every morning. The gel to keep it short I went from clinique to gillette and always the same result.  I was using one blade that made shaving more tolerable gillette\'s sensor excell when my wife arrived from one of her shopping errands and presented me with what came to be my salvation for the next four years, the mach3, which I put together with the Neutrogena sensitive skin gel and clinique\'s aftershave balm and the rest is history. Then I reluctantly accepted my wife\'s new present the Mach3 Power, and voila! My perfect match I haven\'t been this happy in years, comfy with minor irritation and no cuts for months! Until last week! When I felt so confident and adventurous about gillette\'s new product, I spotted it cueing in the supermarket and thougt \'It\'s gillette! More blades, better shave, what can go wrong?\' Well, when I arrived home my wife told me, that machine looks mean, and I replied, yes and I hope its mean with my beard and gentle with my skin, we shared a laugh. Next morning I went to the bathroom and started sahving, one pass, second pass, not bad... third pass... slash, hughe, and I mean big, cut just on the border of my mandible! I was pulling down when this happened! I was being extra careful due to the sharpness of new blades. It peeled off about 3/8\' by almost 2\' of my skin, I have only seen this kind of surgical precision on dermatomes! It took me eons to stop the bleeding. You can imagine my dismay, I got my refund and be done with it for good!Why can\'t Gillette just have a mach3 power with the nice features of battey indicator and the chip set as well as a more powerfull motor? That would work perfectly for anybody, hell... I would buy it, eventhough their product slashed my chin open!P.S. My wife told me \'I told you it looked mean\' I did not laugh.    "

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

Back then I was using Hydro and was satisfied and not willing to change. Then proglide comes out and that same friend described how proglide crushed the fusion in terms of the best shaving experience he ever had. By then I had already made my mind up to give proglide a try based on a thinner blade. As you will see here the overwhelming majority of people including me find this the best shave ever. What I find is I feel like its not shaving it is so easy to use and the results are a smooth shave no bumps or irration. Yes, very expensive and when I tried to go back to hydro I longed for proglide so here I am very satisfied albeit the price is high but my hopes are the price will drop a bit. I wish hydro would come up with a thinner blade because it really does matter. Everyones shaving experience is different but I am able to use the blade a minimum of 5 times before the blade degrades. I did find it challenging to shave moustache area but with time it has gotten better. I do shave my head as well with great ease too. Proglide really changed the shaving game. Highly recommend!    "

The gaudy styling...this is no Apple product! The battery...uh, what? Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...But, I needed a razor and the introductory price for the razor and blade is cheap and so I one-clicked it.Only had a day\'s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby and I didn\'t have to go over areas twice. Even glided smoothy and efficiently over the adams apple area. Battery on one side, unpowered on the other. Didn\'t notice a difference.Not a hard test, not enough for a review either, so I didn\'t shave for 4 or 5 days and tried it again. Non-powered on the right side, it was a dramatic improvement over previous multi-bladed shavers. Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better. Just a hair easier. It does help with a thick growth, not a noticeable difference to me with an overnight\'s worth. Of course, this will be different for everyone.Is the motor worth it? Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here. Would two or three blades work just as well? Not likely the cost would be much less, so what the heck, the more blades the better. Play with those blades. They really are very different than anything I have seen before.I really don\'t think I can get a better shave. A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly. I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don\'t take much time doing it. The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it. It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.The little trimmer blade works well.This is a highly recommended product, one that actually may make some difference in your life if shaving has been difficult for you. It is new and better technology.    "

At first I was little worried because it says to apply at night before bedtime and that you can still take a shower in the morning and need not reapply, unless you want to. Well it turns out that it does work. Turns out that the produxcts does it thing as you are sleeping. Since I have started using it I have no problems with underarm sweating and the scent is very subtle and not overpowering at all. So if you have any doubts about trying this product wait no longer and pick this up now. You will be appy that you did.    "

Now to the point...- Quality of the cleaning - My first impression is that the feeling it leaves after you use the brush is slick and clean.  Im usually the type to brush when I can and I do religiously.  I feel this product does the job well and faster than using a manual toothbrush.- Charge - The charge last pretty much exactly what it says.  Depending how often you use it (I use mine twice-morning and night) It lasts about 10-14 days.- Timer -The quadrant timer is something that is useful as well.  I like how it \'paces\' you through the brushing.  There are times when my mind wanders and with this it gives a little pause in the vibrations to prompt you to go to the next quadrant in your mouth.- Durability -Its been about 5 or 6 months since I\'ve purchased it and it doesnt seem to have any durability issues.  When spending any more money for a high dollar item this is a concern for me.- Sound - The sound is a little bit louder than the Sonicare, but it wasn\'t a big concern for me.Overall, it was a choice between this and the Sonicare line, and I went with this after lots of research.  I like how this comes with a nice travel case so for the trips it is easy to store.  Many of the Sonicare products that is in the same price range did not.  Also the replacement heads for the brush are cheaper with the Oral B (more options to pick also)and it might not be a big deal to everyone, but I\'m sure the cost all adds up after years of use.  With all that aside, I\'m very happy with the product, because of the quality of cleaning. It says 2 minutes for a total clean, but I go the 2 minutes plus an extra 45-60 seconds and I get a better clean than manually brushing for 5 minutes plus.  I never had a \'break in\' time to have my gums adjust, which some people might need, but it was fine and gentle enough for me.  Ill never go back to manual toothbrushes again."

The simple reason is that with the smaller head (with just the cicle of bristles), I feel like I have more control and can really get around my back teeth.  This will really boil down to preference for anyone.  I\'m sure both are great at getting your teeth clean.  But for me, I am going to stick with the standard head that comes with the toothbrush."

I thought that was way better than our manual toothbrushes, but thought I\'d give this a whirl.  It makes a HUGE difference!  For one, the head is much smaller than the SpinBrush.  It\'s just one rotating head, whereas the SpinBrush has a rotating head and another section that goes up and down.  While I thought the rotation wouldn\'t leave my mouth feeling as clean as the double-motion head of the SpinBrush, it actually felt better!  Perhaps the smaller head allows it to get to more places in my mouth, or perhaps it is that the rotation looks, sounds, and feels much faster.  The SpinBrush is battery powered and even with new batteries, I don\'t think the top head spun as fast as this bad boy.  While this toothbrush costs more than the SprinBrush, it\'s still relatively inexpensive and since you can replace the heads, it\'s still a good option for those who don\'t want to spend top dollar on an electric toothbrush.  Overall, I love this toothbrush.  We will see how it stands up over time, but for the week I\'ve been using it, I feel like my mouth is cleaner."

The razor works fine without the power feature which vibrates the blade.  At first, I liked the power feature and used it for about one week, but then I just found it a bit annoying and haven\'t used it since then.  The power feature actually slows you down a bit as you cant rush the blade over your stubble as I have become used to doing after a hot shower in the morning.  I can tell that using 5 blades gives me a slightly closer shave than my previous razor with 3 blades (the mach 3) but I honestly don\'t care about the slight difference.  Hence I have come to the conclusion that this is not much of an advance in shaving technology, in a strange way, it is actually a step backwards as the prices of blades have gone up without a real noticeable enhancement in my shave.  I am glad that they haven\'t stopped making my previous blades and will likely switch back to those after I have used up all of my fusion blades.    "

Like all other variants, you can swap the razor blade and handles, which is convenient. The Embrace blade head has a large design. It\'s still more narrow than say, the Hydro Silk, to you\'ll ultimately need to make more passes because of the narrow path. However, the larger head didn\'t seem to impede shaving very much. I did notice that it tended to bend the wrong way when I was shaving from certain angles, which causes it to drag over my skin. I expected some irritation from it, but nothing happened. It feels a little weird when that happens, but there\'s no lasting effects.I get as good a shave from this as my Venus Divine, which I have always liked. This one has added an extra blade, but I\'m not sure if the shave is that much closer. This design is supposed to be more moisturizing, however. This is due to a large moisturizing strip that surrounds the blades themselves. I noticed that it felt, well, slimier upon first use. The moisture quickly dried up, however. Whenever I step into the shower to use this after leaving it sit, it gets a little moist once again, but it doesn\'t last. In my opinion, I wouldn\'t count on using this without shaving cream for any area other than under your arms.With that said, I\'m not ready to switch over from my Venus Divine.

They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn\'t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it\'s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren\'t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don\'t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)"

I am the kind of person that finds a product that works and uses it for a long time.  I have been using Mitchum deodorant for over 10 years.  Because of my allergies to perfumes and fragrance, I could not use the other Gillette Clinical Strength products. However, when I found this one, it passed the sniff test.  Although it has a scent, it is best described as a \'masking scent.\' This means that while the product is on me, I do not smell it. I can smell it when I put it on, but it does not make me sneeze.  That means, throughout the entire day, I have the protections of the product without the fragrance.The deodorant instructions state to put it on at night, since that is when it works best.  I follow those instructions, but I also put on a small amount after my showers.  It is hot in Southern California, and I have to walk a far distance to teach my classes on campus. I sweat, and what professor wants to stink in front of their class?  Compared to the Mitchum (and a few others I experimented with) this product is the best deodorant I have ever used.  I do not smell myself in front of the class room while teaching.  I have worked outside all day, sweating in hot weather, and when I come inside the house, my underarms smell like I just put the deodorant on.I highly recommend this product.  I have allergies, so I am limited to certain kinds of hygiene products.  Although not completely scent free, this deodorant has done a great job controlling odor and wetness without bothering my nose.  I am more comfortable now because I do not have to worry about smelling bad when talking to someone!Give it a try, and I hope it works for you!    "

I used it for the first time yesterday and can\'t say I find it all that superior.  I did feel it left a smooth shave, but so does the Divine (3 blade version).  The handle felt no different as well, which is apparently one of the selling points to the Embrace since the handle has a bit of cushion and non-skid material.  The blade itself is fairly bulky, and can totally understand the concerns over it\'s size for more delicate areas with curves being more difficult to maneuver around.  The 5 blades are so closely stacked that it clogs quickly if you have more than 1 day of stubble to take care of.My biggest concern with this razor was that it had drag.  The blade cartridge has some \'special\' moisture strips or whatever they are meant to be that just grate over my skin.  It kept making me nervous that I was creating nicks up my legs!  I do have very sensitive skin, so perhaps this is why I didn\'t like the sensation of the actual cartridge, but I wouldn\'t imagine a well lathered leg (with Gillette\'s own shaving cream!) would create such a noxious scratchy drag.But, all this said, the razor gets the job done.  Once I use up the two cartridges/blades that comes with this razor, I will attach the Divine blades to it- which is a good selling point to have a razor that has the capacity to use all of the Venus blades.

What\'s more, once you have reached the two minute mark, a smiley face appears on the digital timer. So helpful! I look forward to following up with my dentist in six months, to track my progress. Once you have been brushing with this toothbrush, diligently, for three weeks, plaque is supposed to diminish. I am already feeling that my teeth are cleaner, compared to brushing with a \'manual\' brush alone.  Well done, Oral-B."

My previous brushes (I have had a lot of them since I owned the toothbrush for many years) never had this problem, even if I used them beyond the recommended 3 months which Oral B recommends.I am now going to contact Direct Super Center and Amazon about this issue, but I have a feeling that Direct Super Center won\'t help, after reading other comments posted here.I love this toothbrush and have had comments by my dentist about just how immaculate my teeth remain, so I will definitely be purchasing more brush heads.

While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  My last toothbrush had a tiny LED screen built into the brush that displayed battery life.  However, after about a year, this screen shorted out and became useless. The unit eventually just gave out and I had to replace it.I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard. I wish I actually had this feature years ago because I was brushing too hard and scrubbed away much of my enamel.It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  There are better brushes for you gums.  However, if I could give half stars, I would give this unit a 4.5/5 star rating.Oral-B was also running a promo at the time; if you buy an qualifying unit, you can receive an 50% mail in rebate.  So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  So for $40, this is a great brush.  This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard no matter which unit/brand you buy. I also like that it takes up a small amount of space on my countertop; I wish the power cord was detachable for easier storage though - not a big deal however.All in all, it is a good brush.  It is a straightforward unit that has just the right amount of features without paying an arm and a leg."

This smaller brush allows you to get all around the molars as well. She did not specify the brand but she did say that it is not a matter of price, it is all about how you use it. So you don\'t really need an expensive one. I bought this one because it gets great reviews and the price is very good. I love it! My gums are way better now and she very impressed (well...and I am very impressed as well!).

The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days.  3 days is the new norm. That\'s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger.  It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference.  After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it\'s smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."

I have all the products - the Merkur\'s safety razors, the Gillette Fatboy, and as assortment of straight razors from Dovo and Thiers Issard.  There is nothing more that I enjoy than lathering up my Rooney silvertip badger and shaving on a weekend morning.  However, for those quick morning shaves before work I always turn to my trusty Gillette, ranging over my shaving career from the Sensor Excel to the Mach III to the Fusion and now the Proglide.  I have to say, each has been an improvement over the previous, with the newest generation being the best.Gillette loves to throw in the marketing gimmicks - the \'enlarged lubrastrip\', the \'redesigned precision trimmer\', the \'micro-combs\', and the \'thinner, finer blades.\'  All of these are just lovely ways of saying - hey, we are not giving you a different colored fusion razor like the phenom or racecar or matrix of whatever they called the other Fusions.What I can say, is that somehow with all these \'innovations\', they have managed to minorly improve an already stellar razor.  It does what it says, it glides better on your face.  It have me a 9/10 shave with one pass with the grain in 1 minute of time with no irritation.  You maybe able to get a 10/10 baby butt smooth shave with a Thiers Issard straight blade with a careful four pass 15 minute shaving, but who has time for that!  And it has less tug, less drag than the fusion.Gillette has always been the King of shaving.  The Fusion has put all other over the counter modern safety razors to shame.  This just follows their precedent.  Yeah, it is a Fusion razor with a blue LED light and some minor changes.  But hey!  It\'s great.  It is an all around great razor.  The Proglide will now be my new go to razor for the prework shave.  I give it four stars because it is a great razor, it\'s the best on the market, but it isn\'t perfection.  Gillette is striving towards it.  I want that 10/10 shave.  That may be too much to ask.  But is Gillette thinks they\'ve gotten it complete figured out, they\'ll stop trying.Good job, Gillette.

I\'ve been using this razor for several months, after waiting to hear from others just how well it works.  I have a fairly tough turf, shaving only MWF, resting on the weekends.  Up until this point, I liked Sensor Excel best, and detest every electric unit I\'ve tried. Since I really like the razor, I was surprised by some of the low rankings. I use Edge gel with extra lubricants, and I shave in the shower (yes, these things make a huge difference).Pro:-Blade life appears improved over my Sensor Excel-Vibrating handle not a gimmick, works well once you get used to it. Initially I found a lack of my normal \'feel\' when shaving, but quickly adapted-A beefy well-weighted handle with a secure seal for the battery.  Other razors have popped apart with the blade flying off on me if I dropped them, but not this one.  My Sensor Excel was notorious for this.-Large blade \'eject button\' is nice, yet doesn\'t let the blade pop off prematurely (see above)-The \'hole\' in the handle head is great! I have a wire rack that holds my shampoo and soap.  This same rack has a few \'hangers\' that this razor slides onto nicely-Very good battery life (still on the first one months later)-Plastic holder has a bigger \'foot\' to stay upright better and it\'s easier to see at a glance how many blades that I have left due to the clear sides, a feature that my Sensor lacks-On/off button flashes when battery gets low... hard to miss and allows you to get a least one shave-Best for last: a very close shave on a very tough faceCon:-Razor head is large, single blade on the back is a good idea and is sharp, but I can\'t seem to make it work as good as it sounds. It\'s a first generation idea that I am hoping gets some refinement.-Price... Ouch! Fewer blades per pack AND much more expensive. Buy in bulk, look for sales, save coupons-Plastic tray is much larger than my Sensor yet holds fewer spare blades (4).-Old blades from Sensor are not compatible with Fusion (you can mitigate this problem by taking your old shaver to work for those embarrassing days when you miss a small spot)Bottom line: Recommended if you\'ve got a rough face! Doing it all over again, I would buy it again.  Also, I recommend that you try different gels, shaving in the shower, different shaver brands as each face is different and Fusion is pricy.    "

I\'ve progressed over the years from an electric razor to progressively a one blade, two blade, three blade, and now a five blade gillette - battery powered and otherwise. Have I ever noticed a major difference moving one to the next - not sure - but like many others of you I tend to buy the latest just to say that I have it.Shaving differences well truth be told the biggest revelation for me was when I switched from electric to the one blade gillette - I\'d used the electric for twenty years since the time when I had to shave in the first place. What a revelation! The electric took for ever and seemed to grind your beard down much like a power sander. By contrast the one blade hand gillette was quick clean and gave you the impression that you\'d actually had a shave in the first place.Since then I suppose I have detected minor improvements as I\'ve progressed from one blade to two and more etc. But the changes are only apparent initially and you soon just don\'t notice, and they are sure not as marked as the transition from electric to manual. It\'s a bit like the difference between an expensive bottle of wine and a slightly cheaper one, or a good hi fi system and a not quite so good hi fi system - the differences are suttle - but there sure must be a big difference between a one blade and a five blade gillette. The only \'primitive\' razor I\'ve tried recently is a disposable and it is sure streets ahead of that.Aside from the disposable I\'ve never gone back to a lesser (ie fewer blades) gillette to test the extent of the improvement - perhaps I should. Anyway it\'s a good, well presented, piece of marketing - and as I said like many of you I\'d rather have the five blade than many that went before.Oh and by the way I don\'t cut myself with the five blader as I have with previous fewer bladed models so there is something tangible! Perhaps that is a good pointer to a better razor.    "

And then, there is the rare product that comes along which goes beyoyond the hype and acclaim. And which exceeds all expectations. Allow me to introduce to you the latter, the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush. I will not take up too much time by reiterating all the 5-star reviews. But do read these reviews; because they are right on the money. One review in particular claimed how using this product cured his bad breath problem. This claim really got my attention. I too suffered from bad breath. And no amount of brushing or tongue scraping would solve the problem of bad breath. So this claim along with many of the other positive reviews persuaded me to give the Oral-B a try. Results...Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Upon initial use it felt like I had been to the dentist office for a dental cleaning (and like so every time after use). And yes...no more bad breath...simply amazing!  Is the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush worth the price? Consider the convenience of getting a truly professional dental cleaning (at home) without having to go to a Dental Hygienist. Also, consider the cost involved of going to a dental hygienist for cleaning every six months or so. The Oral-B is worth the price many many many times over.  Note: If you have not had cleaning for a while (or not good cleaning), you may experience slight bleeding of the gums for a couple of weeks of use. As the toothbrush rids your dentals of the old and new trapped food particles (which will turn to plaque via bacteria if not cleaned of), you will experience bleeding less and less until no more. Be advised, the sticker that attaches the timer/clock to a surface, like a wall, is of industrial strength. When it sticks it stays sticked. You may pull away some of your wall, or other used surface, if you try to remove it after sticking it on. Like me, you may choose not to use sticker and just place timer/clock on sink counter-top (or a stand for eye level). However, I now use the timer/clock as a bathroom clock mostly. Because the the Oral-B toothbrush device also has a built-in timer guide. The quadrant cleaning method illustrated in the user manual seemed a bit tedious for me. I have developed a more desirable method for myself. This procedure is as follows: starting from the top chop going left outer...moving to back then going inner around to other side until at that back then around that outer side to where I started (spending a second or two on each tooth). And likewise with my bottom chop. Time-wise, the whole procedure takes around two minutes or so. You can follow the user manual guide or develop your own strategy. The main thing is to make sure that you reach all tooth and gum areas (top and bottom chops; inner and outer surfaces, and top of dentals).  Now then! How quickly should you get the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush? Don\'t walk. Don\'t skip or hop! Don\'t even run!! But warp-speed!!! And seek a desirable  merchant to acquire this dental magician."

There\'s a certain segment of the population that perceives a certain elegance, an elan, if you will (or if you won\'t), a panache and flair to products named with a bon mot. Pantene... it sounds elegant(though it has no French meaning--not that it matters) and, by the way, it works pretty darn well.That\'s the most important thing here, Pantene \'FIne Hair SOlutions Flat to Volume\' Conditioner does what it says it will do: Add s bit of of volume (or the appearance of volume) by coating your hair strands, and adding sheen by aligning them.  IT reduce tangles, does not have an unpleasant smell, and basically has a reasonable price. Yes, you can go cheaper, and you might as well give those a try.While we\'re talking about language, what\'s with the name \'Flat to Volume\' --is it an awkward shorthand for \'Your hair looks flat, see, and this stuff will give it VOLUME. Therefore, Flat to Volume!\'  IT might annoy you for a few seconds, or perhaps this is Pantenese, and I\'m the one who should know better.Pantene comes out of the bottle fairly thick, so use just a little. Spread it around your hair, and it becomes much less viscous. I\'d recommend also that you rinse thoroughly.  I thought I detected a slight allergic reaction on my part (some itching) compared to not using it, but this is a tenuous connection and may have nothing to do with the product.  However, like all beauty/cosmetic products, it\'s probably better to buy ONE of these first to determine whether you have any adverse reactions.  Bottom line: I\'d buy it again, but it didn\'t blow me away either.  If you\'re not happy with the conditioner you use now and you tend towards the thin hair end of the follicle spectrum, then this is certainly worth a try. Bon chance a vous!

My skin felt very smooth after just one use.  I like that the pivoting head made it easy to shave underarms and around the knees without knicks or remaining hairs.My only complaint, as one other person mentioned, was that the excessive amount of plastic on either side of the blades makes for a lot of extra work.

5839,2666,2734,20100831,B003UKKHB4,5,"August 31, 2010",AQM0K7MBBT4AY,"UPDATED: Amazing, amazing toothbrush.","&lt;&lt;UPDATE: I\'ve been using this toothbrush for a month or so, and recently realized... my teeth have ACTUALLY GOTTEN NOTICEABLY WHITER. The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush. I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well. Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH. I stand by this toothbrush as a high-quality product. It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.>>I have 5 dental implants, so taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.At a recent visit to my dentist I was told I had receeding gums around one of my implants. The problem? Part of it was that the implant crown wasn\'t seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard. The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.I went to Target and bought their generic \'Up & Up\' brand electric toothbrush. This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums. However, when the Oral-b 3000 came out on Amazon Vine, I knew I had to order & review it.The Oral-b 3000 does NOT disappoint. For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic \'Up & Up\' model I was using before. Second, it actually lights up when you\'re brushing too hard. I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I\'m distracted and in a hurry to get to work. It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.Another nice feature is the \'timer\' function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits. This is also nice, as many of us tend to hurry through our brushing routine. The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom. The brush unit\'s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn\'t notice a decrease in power. This is a nice contrast with my Up & Up toothbrush which, though it claims it\'ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.I\'ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far. My old unit is in storage and probably won\'t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas. I haven\'t made use of the different brushing modes, but I\'m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth, will appreciate these.All in all the brush unit, brush head, and charger included in this package are all great and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than, the competing brands/brushes. The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth & gums, the unit pays for itself handily. I recommend!"

Design, power indicator, its power which seems to be more powerful than the M3, the aloe strip and the extra blade on the back of it! BUT, this thing has one blade too many in the front, this razor WILL CUT YOU if you are not careful! You could probably kill someone with it! The blades on the cartridges are extremely sharp and shaving time increases to over twice the time as with the Gillette M3, due to that extra fourth blade and the size of the cartridge, which forces you to be extra careful and shave very slowly, so as not to cut yourself. If it only had one less blade in the front, it would certainly be the best razor in the world! Gillette, if you are reading this, consider this advise seriously and remove that fourth blade, because you created one hell of a scalpel. I am rating it two stars, despite the many pluses already mentioned, but since its primary and only purpose is to shave, I cannot honestly say it does a good job. I\'ve used disposable razors that are about $0.49 cents that are faster and better. I do not recommend it, unless they remove that fourth blade. I do recommend the M3 Nitro from Gillete as well and which is the one I am now using.    "

First it covers a much larger area so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors. A few strokes and you\'re done. i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!! i read a reviewer\'s comment saying that Embrace is the same as a 1 blade razor. NO WAY!! this one doesn\'t even compare to the one with 3 blades!!it is so practical, you don\'t need to go over the same area more than once or twice. the smoothing \'bands\' (meant for exfoliation i suppose) seem to assist the shaving because they smoothe the area perfectly. i was TOTALLY IMPRESSED with this one. The head is very flexible so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts. i have a sensitive skin but it is hard to cut yourself with this one - unless you overdo it or if you have very little hair. You don\'t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).i read a review by a man who uses this razor, well i use men\'s foam! i DON\'T use the foaming gels made for women. they foam much less than men\'s products. i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target\'s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper prices.i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product.

Cuts my skin, not a close shave, requires too much pressure to bring blades in contact with skin.","I recently discovered Gillette\'s Venus line of razors (I know, they\'ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite). Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \'what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel so I don\'t have to lather up my skin?\'. Apparently, something other than these Venus Spa refills with the shave gel built in.I don\'t know; maybe I just got a bad batch of razor cartridges, but the one that I opened up doesn\'t really release any shave gel until I\'ve moved well beyond a leg or forearm or two. When it DOES release that gel, it\'s more as a concentrated, thin \'string\' of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair. Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger\'s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor\'s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \'lips\' to get the \'teeth\' to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it\'s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades. Just not well executed.I\'d read all of the reviews for the single packs of Venus Spa cartridges, so I knew that there\'d be a 50/50 shot that I\'d actually like these, but putting them into use for myself solidified it for me. You shouldn\'t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that\'s what I feel like I need to get these to work right. As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I\'ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges. At this rate, I\'d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much. THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference. THESE razor cartridges? Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o\'clock shadow every day, and I didn\'t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble! If you like one of Gillette\'s other types of Venus cartridges, stick with those. As has been proven to me before, the grass ISN\'T always greener on the other side! And the stubble may actually be longer!    "

I do like the way the blades are set neatly in the plactic molded container so you just retrieve them by sticking the handle in, hearing the click and then pulling it out.  The others I use have the plastic tabs you have to break off and then shake the blade out.  I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade.  It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill.  I did like the ones I bought to try, but will not buy more until they come down in price.

I can run the razor over my skin fast, with very light pressure, and it still shaves perfectly. For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area. With every other razor (even the Breeze, which was my prior favorite) I had to slow way down and go carefully or I\'d nick myself in those spots. So I can shave faster! I shave in the shower, and I don\'t find shave gel or foam to be necessary.My problems with razor burn and bumps in the underarm and bikini area are over. Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions. With previous razors I had to shave those spots repeatedly in different directions, using a lot of pressure, to get a close shave. That lead to painful razor burn, and so most of the time I just tolerated a rough shave there. No more! I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure. Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.There are two things I don\'t like about the Embrace cartridges:Cost: They\'re expensive! But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher cost.The size: They\'re big. The only reason this is a problem for me is the shower pod: Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they *don\'t* fit in the Breeze shower pod.  I ended up buying an Embrace starter pack with a handle and shower pod so I could store the cartridges in the shower pod.  I didn\'t realize until I opened the starter pack that the Embrace shower pod only holds *two* cartridges. So when you open a 4-pack of cartridges, you\'ll have to keep the extra cartridges somewhere else. One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else. It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \'cute\' over making it useful for storage. At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall so it doesn\'t get knocked onto the shower floor and stepped on.(Another reviewer reported that the shower pod keeps detaching from the wall. I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn\'t get bumped and rarely gets splashed. It\'s remained firmly attached for months. I also have a fiberglass shower. I don\'t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy tile.)Summary: The Embrace cartridge gives a truly superior shave. It\'s worth every cent.EDIT: April 11, 2011: Wouldn\'t you know it, shortly after I wrote this glowing review I got a bad batch. The bad cartridges didn\'t shave as smoothly and I had some mild razor burn with them. They also seemed to dull more quickly. Since the bad batch I had tried another box and they worked well again. I am not changing my five-star rating yet, but I will be paying attention to whether the bad box was a fluke, or a warning of quality control problems.    "

Since that generally means I use different deodorants, I\'ve also found that I am fairly sensitive too--some deodorants (that don\'t brag about being strong) will irritate my under-arms.  That\'s not a good combo--to be blessed with genes that make me perspire more than average, yet be sensitive to many deodorants.So, enter this Gillette Clinical Strength.  I had both very high hopes (that it would solve my odor issues), yet was a bit worried that, especially since I had never used anything Clinical Strength before, that it would surely irritate me in some way.To my surprise, everything seemed great.  It\'s basically odorless, goes on smoothly and doesn\'t leave any residue.  Thankfully, no irritation whatsoever, to my surprise.  On a day to day basis, it covers me all day long with no odor (which is way above and beyond many deodorants I\'ve tried).The ONLY reason it didn\'t get all five stars is because I can occasionally tell that it didn\'t fully cover me; but only when I\'ve been doing a decent amount of physical work or been in the heat.  Perhaps I\'m asking too much, but for me, the perfect five star deodorant would be able to get me through a 24-hour period even if I did a decent amount of physical activity.Even though I\'m a very frugal person, and although I was \'manly\' enough to occasionally break through this deodorant, I will certainly pay a premium for this deodorant in the future, as it works better than all the other many brands I\'ve used.  Good job, Gillette.    "

I pictured the coroner finding my severed head in the shower, this thing clutched in my hands, \'air raid\' scrawled on the shower in blood. I have to admit- it is arguably the best shave I have ever had. I shave my head as well and I half expected it to look like a bowl of coleslaw when done but nary a nick at all. I found that due to it\'s size it did need fixing on a curve or two, but overall I was very impressed. I have been using Gillette disposable up till now. So it has impressed my skin, but now it has to make peace with my wallet. It all boils down to how long the blades last. I expect at least a week out of each. Usually those green \'lube\' strips are the first to go and after that the razors become pretty brutal. AT this price point I don\'t want to use more than one blade every week.

I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3\'s were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I\'ve had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an \'upgrade\' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you\'re handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, \'What were they thinking?!\' crosses my mind.  I\'ve discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

I had it filled, but the week before I had it done I immediately searched on amazon for this electronic toothbrush. Now, I can\'t live without it. I feel it\'s cleaning my teeth down to a micro-level AND it\'s so easy to brush for 2 minutes because the electronic toothbrush notifies you when time is up. I definitely wouldn\'t count 120 seconds (I\'ve never ever ever in my life brushed for that long). THANK YOU ORAL-B!! Thank you AMAZON!

Unfortunately, at some point within the last few years they changed the design of the tampon. They used to be kind of a rectangular shape but would open in width and length. The new design is still shaped sort of rectangular but only opens in width and is not as comfortable. I guess they thought making it expand in width was a good idea, but the problem is that the shape makes it uncomfortable. Why can\'t they just make them more round shaped liked every single other tampon brand? Makes no sense.Although I would rather buy the cardboard applicator kind because they are better for the environment, I can\'t see myself buying these again. They can\'t even do something as obvious as making the applicator tip rounded for comfortable insertion. Kotex is a reasonably priced brand that is more comfortable to remove than these."

The Embrace is the first time I feel like they\'ve improved on the original design.  The Breeze has a similar moisture ribbon, but it always melts off before the blades are worn out, and the heads are just too expensive for that to be tolerable.The moisture ribbon on the Embrace is pretty solid to the touch so you really don\'t get any more than you need and it doesn\'t melt prematurely.  There\'s no residue on my legs when I\'m done shaving, just smooth skin.  The best part is I can have both legs shaved from ankle to hip in one third of the time it used to take me to shave with other razors because I don\'t need to use shave gel, and the handle and the shape of the head make it really hard to cut myself, so I can just go zip-zop.The only issue I\'ve had is that it\'s slightly tricky to shave armpits with the Embrace because the head is so big, and it\'s a bit difficult to maneuver in intimate areas.  It\'s no less effective than other razors, it just takes some adaptation and adds a little time.  That said, all in all, my total shave time -- legs, armpits, intimate region -- is half of what it used to be, and that\'s more than worth the price of the Embrace.    "

You want some serious cleaning? You need Philips Sonicare.There are good things of this toothbrush, but I think the disappointing things outweigh them. For one thing, the brush\'s head is larger than the Sonicare\'s. This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.The one positive thing is the toothbrush\'s compactness. It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior. But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare."

I got a set of sensitive heads because I have sensitive gums and never tried the other heads.  I like the sensitive heads.  Between flossing and brushing with this thing, my teeth feel almost as clean as walking out of a dentist office.  I used to see plaque build-up between visits behind my lower incisors.  This brush manages to clean that plaque away.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  In the past, I\'d occasionally see bleeding gums while flossing.  I haven\'t seen that recently.The toothbrush felt funny to use at first.  My teeth felt like they were \'buzzing\' a little after brushing.  I don\'t notice that any more.  The handle feels bulky, but I\'m able to maneuver it fine now and I can certainly clean more tooth surfaces with this brush than my old non-electric brush.  What\'s nice is that you simply have to position the brush properly and it vibrates to perform the cleaning.  I like the wireless timer that guides me through brushing 30 seconds in each quadrant.Set-up could have been easier.  Instructions were so-so and removing the back cover of the clock/timer was more difficult than it should have been.  But, day-to-day use is easy and rewarding.After using for 6 months, the wireless display became very finicky over batteries.  It goes haywire if the battery isn\'t fully charged.  The first set of batteries lasted 6 months.  I replaced with fresh energizers; they lasted only two months.  I checked the energizers with my multimeter and they register solidly in the \'good\' range---the batteries are fine."

What confuses me so much is why would anyone want to buy this in packs of 6? I have been using the bottle I bought last time for more than 1 year and it still has at least 1/3rd remaining (Even after shaving daily with lavish amount of gel.) So 6 pack should at least last for 6 years or so. I don\'t see the point of buying this 6 pack unless someone wants to use it as shower gel or so.Also even with the subscribe and save option this is pricier than walmart or target.

It gets reasonably close and is pretty smooth until you find it is time to replace the cartridge. This is where you hit a brick wall. $26.00 for a pack of cartridges is really one of the more ludacris ideas I\'ve heard in a while. I get just as good a shave with a Bic disposable single blade so five blades really isn\'t better. Hell, THREE blades is unecessary (and two can be downright painful). I have purchased a Mercur safety razor which I think will hold me over for a good forty years as it is a tried and true antiquity, is a single blade, and the said blades cost like a buck for ten at Longs (standard double edge). Horrendous value cartridge-wise and not really a terribly good shave to boot. I really should probably have given it a one star, but hey, it works. If you\'re under eighteen, wait \'till they send you a free promotional one (they most likely will). If you\'re over, I highly recomend you stray from this series.

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

I had no problem with the performance of the tampon (although it was a bit more difficult to use), but I\'m quite bothered by the production and disposal of this product.  It feels so wasteful to use plastic so briefly and then toss it in the trash.  The plastic is made from oil, which keeps us dependent on other countries and pollutes the air, and then it lingers on in landfills or floats out to sea.  It was recently reported that whale carcasses washing up on California\'s beaches had plastic tampon applicators in their stomachs, among other debris.No, I think Tampax would do better to improve upon their cardboard applicators which at least can be sourced from recycled paperboard or from sustainably managed forests.  Or perhaps I\'ll forgo the applicator all together and just use o.b. tampons."

Tried it and got the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had. I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.That sample Fusion blade lasted about 3 months (I kid you not) and I do have a heavy beard. Wow, I thought. These blades are expensive, but if I didn\'t have to change them as often, it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills. The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.I purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out. What the heck? After about a week the replacement blade was dull. I went through the 4 pack in about a month and bought a second pack at another retailer. Same thing. One week=1 blade.Gillette must really think we\'re stupid. Give the suckers a free sample that\'s great and make them pay for crummy blades after they\'ve committed to the system. Never again, Gillette.....I just ordered a Braun cordless from Amazon so you can just go pick someones else\'s pocket.Edited: Any suckers our there still letting Gillette rip them off? Yeah, I guess so since they\'re still in business. The Braun electric I mention above has recently been relegated to backup status to my Merkur double edge razor. Yep, one of those things like my dad used and that I learned to shave with. Blades cost about 7 cents each in bulk and last about a week. Let\'s see...that a penny a shave for the blades plus a few cents worth of TOBS shave cream. Give it a try and tell Gillette what they can do with the Fusion.    "

There are 5 blades, all parallel to each other, which is the secret to the close shave. Each blade is sharper than the one above it. The first blade, which is the least sharp, functions to pull the hair out of the follicle a bit, then the second blade cuts the hair and pulls on it some more, then the third blade cuts some more and pulls the hair out even further. Finally, before the hair can snap back, the fourth blade moves in, and cuts the wily hair to infinity. My theory is that the fifth blade is just a marketing ploy and it really doesn\'t do anything. So, if you are willing to spend the money for the closest shave ever, buy this product. Or, if you are out of work because of the economy, you should get a Bic razor from Wal Mart.    "

The first day I grabbed the Fusion ProGlide with my hand I noticed a big difference in the handle. Just like everyone is saying you definitely feel a much more better grip in your hands. I was impressed when Gillette came out with the Fusion razor thinking wow this is the razor I will use forever, but when they came out with the Fusion ProGlide I was blown away. To this date I am STILL using the FIRST blade that came with the razor..... Yeah you heard right the FIRST BLADE. I bought it about 2 months ago and each time I shave it feels so good. No more irritations, no more having to feel that your beard is getting pulled, no more razor bumps at least for me. Once my beard grew back I shaved with my old razor the Gillette Fusion don\'t get me wrong it\'s a great product but after 4 to 5 times one shaves I started to notice all of the above I have mentioned. Especially the redness after I shaved half of my face. I switched to the Fusion ProGlide to finish the other half of my face and let me tell you it was the best feeling ever on my face it truly does glide. Like a hot knife cutting through a stick of butter. I use to hate shaving but with this new product from Gillette I enjoy shaving once again and most importantly this will save me a lot of money when buying the blades. They will last longer trust me on that. I recommend this Fusion ProGlide to anyone.    "

I\'ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them. They were loud, heavy and large in the hand. I was hesitant to try a power toothbrush again, but my dentist suggested it was time to cave and get another. So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush. It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud. I especially like the additional small brush head that comes with it. The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth. The small size of the brush is also great for travel. For short trips I just pack the toothbrush with a regular brushhead cover. For longer trips, I throw in the base and the brush. The base is not too large, so it is not a huge annoyance to pack. My one complaint (and thus the 4 stars) would be that it does not come with a travel case. Seems kind of odd since its size makes it a great travel power toothbrush."

My first thought...you just want me to buy a $100+ toothbrush that works just as well as my one at home. Of course, like a fish attracted by something shiny I hopped on the internet to take a look at electric toothbrushes. I probably spent 5 hours reading everything I could on these. A lot of people were talking about the one that has a UV cleaner in it. I call gimmick. Anyways, I ended up with this one and was extremely skeptical.1. The timer is separate from the brush and sits on your counter and has a picture of a smiling tooth on it, kind of hard not to feel like this is a joke2. What the heck, charged this puppy up and waited till after dinner3. Initiate brushing sequence4. Having the handle buzz after 30 seconds to let you know to move to a new quadrant and having it show on the timer is very useful. It makes it seem like it is going by really fast.5. If you brush too hard the handle stops pulsating till you back off. I literally put the brush head on each tooth and just move down, not really doing any real brushing but just letting the vibrations do the work.6. After I spit and rinsed out my mouth, it literally felt like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. They stay smooth almost the entire day depending on what you eat.This was $$$ well spent in my opinion. I highly recommend getting one of these. Don\'t forget, you are supposed to change your brush head every 3 months or so. Might want to price that into your purchase."
4770,1597,1638,20080904,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 4, 2008",A1ZM846Y7AUYD,A Breakthrough in Power Toothbrush Design,"I have used many different power toothbrushes over the past several years.  All have been from the Sonicare and Oral-B line of products.  I have been amazed at how the technology and design of these products have changed over the years.  They continue to get smaller, more powerful, and now tend to include multiple operation modes and interchangeable brushes and accessories.  Although there is clearly nothing wrong with scrubbing your teeth the traditional way, with a good old-fashioned toothbrush, I find that the power toothbrushes tend to remove stains better and keep my teeth whiter.Gone are the days when a power toothbrush was a rather bulky, noisy product.  Oral-B has introduced a new, extremely slim, power toothbrush that is not much bigger than a traditional (manual) toothbrush.  The new Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is truly a breakthrough in power toothbrush design.  Weighing a mere 1.8 oz., with the brush head attached, the dimensions of the handle and brush assembly is roughly 8 1/4\' long and only 11/16\' (just under 3/4\') around at the thickest part of the handle.  The brush head is about 2/3 of the width and 3/4 of the length of a traditional toothbrush.  The charging base measures approximately 1 3/4\' - H x 1 5/8\' - W x 3\' - D.  While I like the small footprint of the charging base, I find it a bit too light, which causes it to slide around on the countertop too easily.Some of the manufacturer boasted features of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush are as follows:* Provides Gentle Sonic Vibration - More than 27,000 Vibrations per Minute* Multiple User Modes:  Clean (normal) and Sensitive* Super-Thin Bristles for Precision Cleaning, Polishing  and Whitening*  Professional Timer, Providing Tactile Feedback at 30-second Intervals for Changing Quadrants of Your Mouth, and Once the Dental Expert Recommended 2-minute Brushing Time Has Been Reached* Provides Up To 30 Minutes Of Use Between Charges* Reduces Up to 94% of Surface Stains in 2 Weeks* Lightweight Slim Handle Provides Effective Maneuverability and Control* Warranty:  2-Year LimitedThe current Pulsonic S15 kit includes the following items:-  Oral-B Pulsonic Power Handle- One Standard Pulsonic Brush Head- One Precision Tip Brush Head- Charging Base w/ Brush Head Storage- Instruction Manual- Misc. Warranty and Registration PaperworkSetting up and using the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush couldn\'t be any easier.  The small charging base simply plugs into an available A/C outlet and sits on your countertop.  Although the instruction manual doesn\'t specifically mention anything about mounting the charging base, there are two slotted holes on the backside, which would allow for wall mounting.  Once the charging base is plugged in you simply sit the Pulsonic Power Brush handle into a recessed opening on the front of the base.  As with most rechargeable products these days, you must initially wait several hours for the device to charge before you begin using it.  The Pulsonic toothbrush requires 12 hours on the charging base before it is fully charged.  The instructions do not say anything about using the toothbrush before it is fully charged, so I guess one could try it out within an hour or two if they wished.  There are two other recessed openings on the base, to allow for storage of the included Precision Tip brush head and a spare standard brush head.  The front of the toothbrush handle has a single power/mode button and three indicator lights.  Two of the LED indicators show what cleaning mode the brush is in, when powered on (clean or sensitive), while the third LED lights up when the device is charging.  A single push of the power/mode button activates the power toothbrush in \'Clean\' mode, while a second push of the button switches the toothbrush into \'Sensitive\' mode.  Pushing the button a third time powers the toothbrush off.  Therefore, if you push the button once, and use the standard clean mode, you will need to push the button twice more in order to power the device off.Unlike the typical oscillating head type power toothbrushes that Oral-B is known for, which require the user to simply hold the head on each tooth for cleaning, this Pulsonic model requires you to move the head around in a circular motion while cleaning.  This can take a little getting used to if you are more accustomed to the oscillating brush-type models, like I am.  There is no need to scrub your teeth with the Pulsonic toothbrush.  You simply move the brush head gently over your teeth (in the aforementioned circular motion), letting the sonic vibrations perform the work of cleaning and polishing your teeth.  Although these vibrations are fairly gentle, switching to the sensitive mode reduces the strength of the vibration by about 1/3.  The vibration speed remains the same, but the intensity becomes gentler and feels less abrasive against your teeth.  While brushing, the Pulsonic toothbrush provides a short stutter (a single break in vibration), at 30-second intervals, to let you know that you are supposed to switch quadrants in your mouth.  Once you have brushed for the professionally recommended 2-minutes, a longer stutter (two breaks in vibration) can be heard and felt.  This form of tactile feedback is quite effective in keeping the user informed as to the status of their brushing session.Once you have finished brushing with the Pulsonic toothbrush, cleanup is a snap.  You simply run the brush head under water and rinse thoroughly.  To better clean the top portion of the toothbrush handle, you can easily remove the brush head attachment by turning the head counter-clockwise (about 1/4 turn) and lifting it off the handle.  The top portion of the handle can be rinsed under running water, but it is not recommended to run water over the lower, controller portion of the handle.  Reinstalling the brush head onto the handle is as simple as lowering it into place and giving about a 1/4 clockwise turn.  You will hear and feel it click into place.  Cleaning the charging base is just as easy.  Since you should never get the electrical portion of the charger base wet, Oral-B has designed the base with a removable top, which can then be cleaned under running water.  To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  After cleaning the removable portion, you can wipe the bottom portion of the base with a dry cloth.  To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  She has been using it regularly and has given me the following pros and cons for this Pulsonic model:Pros******- Extremely slim and lightweight.- Comfortable to hold and is well balanced- Very quiet operation- Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth & gums- Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth & gums- Easy to use and clean- Perfect size for travel- Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work- Charging base takes up very little space on the countertopCons*******- Charging base slides around countertop too easily- No low battery warning indicator- No indication of when charging is complete- Spare brush storage is not covered- No travel/storage case includedMy wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  She has stayed away from power toothbrushes in the past because she didn\'t like the fat handles, noisy operation, and uncomfortable brush heads.  Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  She doesn\'t like leaving the brush heads exposed, so she keeps the spares in a drawer, due to the lack of covered brush storage on the base.  She also wishes that the charging base was weighted, so that it wouldn\'t slide around on the counter so easily.  She informed me that she wants the base mounted to the wall so she doesn\'t have to continue dealing with it sliding around.Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife\'s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B\'s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  I was very tempted to give this Pulsonic toothbrush a 5-star rating, but I honestly feel that Oral-B has overlooked a few important details that will hopefully be corrected on future model releases.  First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don\'t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  The charging base either needs to be weighted or should have better griping foot pads to prevent it from sliding all over the place.  And why they don\'t have a low battery indicator on this toothbrush is anyone\'s guess.  Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  Since the Pulsonic is the perfect size for travel, including a travel case would make perfect sense.  Hopefully they will at least offer a Pulsonic travel case, as an optional accessory, in the near future.  My wife and I consider the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush a 4 and 1/2 star product, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powered brush but doesn\'t want the typical fat-handled, noisy products that have always been the norm."

Also while it holds up just fine while going through your daily routine, it does not seem to keep up all that well with the sweat you get from a workout.Personally, I\'m sticking with Old Spice simply because I like the smell better.

I tried to avoid Gillette products because of the cost (I am a frugal college student), but I have never been satisfied with any other product. I do notice, however, that Gillette blades, including the Fusion ProGlide, do not last as long as other, cheaper products like disposable razors. They dull relatively quickly (about a week and a half for me with daily use). I should note that I have both more than average and thicker facial hair, which I am sure contributes to the short life of my blades.    "

It\'s an electric toothbrush that\'s about the same size a conventional toothbrush!And it does a good job of cleaning my teeth. I\'ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I\'m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance. It\'s a mighty little toothbrush.The one and only drawback I\'ve found -- and it\'s a small one --  is that unlike the Sonicare the Pulsonic doesn\'t have a 2 minute timer. Instead it has a 30 second timer.  You have to count to four without electronic assistance (Four 30-sec treatments equal 2 minutes which is my Dentist\'s recommended brushing time.)Also as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars. Most toothbrushes -- both electric and non-electric -- fail this test. So that\'s another big plus.So in a nutshell, if you\'re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel), small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all."

I personally use the Venus Spa Breeze and loved when it first came out  a few years later and the novelty has worn off.  I find that they are not shaving as well as they used to and the \'bar\' on the actual razor head is not providing any sort of lubrication when it comes to shaving.Now onto the Pro Skin!  These come with a nifty little shower hook that suction cups to my tiled wall rather well.  What happened to the hard snap case that holds the razor in the front and brand new cartridges inside??  This was a big disappointment.  Where am I supposed to store the cartridges?  I hate when I have to separate things because I end up finding unused cartridges of a brand that I am no longer using and disposed of the handle a long time ago (HELLO INTIUTION).  After my initial disappointment and annoyance of that change I vowed to keep an open mind.  The shaving went great!  I found my legs feeling way smoother than they have in a couple of years.  The \'Moisturerich\' head really seems to work.  For me it did not drip or ooze  I think that may be a factor of how much water you are using and how long you are shaving.  My one complaint is that it doesn\'t do as well in the bikini area or around my knees because of the bar  but that is to be expected with this type of shaver.Highly recommend but wish that companies would stop skimping and charging more.  My husband actually commented on the smoothness & suppleness of my legs the very next day when he bumped my calf.  This lead to stroking my whole leg  at the time it didn\'t click that it was actually the Pro Skin razor.  I think I may replace my Spa Breeze with the Pro because at the end of the day I like my legs to feel as if they have been moisturized with lotion.

I have been using Oral-b products for years and knew they are a good product.  I do not need all the bells and whistles they offer and this one had everything I need.I have been using it for about a month now and really like it.  It holds a charge really well and it came fully charged.  The 2 minute dentist recommended time indicator is great.  I find I brush longer now and pay more attention to each area because I know I will be reminded when it is time to change areas.  I have used a smaller toothbrush for years and found this one to be a perfect size brush as well as the handle is not that much bigger than a manual toothbrush.  The only thing that I don\'t love is the cord is in the base - not detachable so the base needs a larger space to accomidate the cord.  Not a large space but more than it would if the cord was detachable.I would definately buy another or recommend it to others.

Now I\'m one of them!!I was normally purchasing replacement heads at one of the \'big box\' outlets but they were out of stock. Caught sight of the price and thought if they\'re the same, why not?My opionion: THEY ARE NOT THE SAME! The packaging looks legit, and before you use one for the first time, product seems legit. After a few uses, kapoot! Head gets wobbly, then loose, then gone.I agree with a prior reviewer that the likelyhood of someone going to all the trouble of setting up a production line to produce fake knock-offs, at this price point, would be very low. I believe, as others, that Braun simply started using an alternate source for production without paying attention to quality.Braun, if you\'re paying attention: Address this issue soon, as you will be losing a number of die-hard customers!Amazon, if you\'re paying attention: Consider contacting your sellers about these obviously inferior products.

They very cleverly use terms like \'a better way to shave\' or \'30% closer blades\', and there is a reason for this. The reality is that very little (if any) improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems. And Gillette knows this through their own internal research. Their studies show that customers can\'t discern the difference between 3-blade and Fusion systems. It is all just perception. However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems. The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.Here is another interesting tidbit you probably didn\'t know about all of this. Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements. Well there is a reason for this too. The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer. Gillette doesn\'t want folks to get a bad first impression. As you probably know, they don\'t make money on the razors. The real money is with the replacement blades. And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.With the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.

It produces a STRONG vibration...VERY strong.  Not for the young child or the sensitive mouth.  I seriously felt like I\'d put a power drill into my mouth!That being said, I\'d have to say it is worth the uncomfortable feeling (which I\'m starting to get used to) -- even after just the first use, my teeth looked shiny and polished, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  And despite the strong vibration, I didn\'t have any issues with my gums bleeding.  I think it just takes some getting used to, especially if, like me, you\'re not used to using a power toothbrush.So I would say that the only downside is that you can\'t control the level of vibration -- it\'s either on or off.  Sometimes it would be nice to turn it down a bit (especially in the morning...though I guess it\'s an effective way to wake up!).  ;-)  Adjustable power levels would make this a 5-star product.  It would also be nice if it had an indicator light that tells you when it\'s fully charged or charging."
