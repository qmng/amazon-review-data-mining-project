I checked my packaging and product against the photos and info provided by Amazon customers. I have in the past received counterfeit brush heads from Amazon.

I Didnt Think I Would..,"I am a huge fan of Venus razors (except their price).This razor has built in shaving lotion, it suds up and gets the skin ready for the shave without needing to use shaving cream/lotion. I like the shower hook, keeps the razor out of the way in the shower. The packaging had to be the easiest razor package I have ever opened, it wasnt the obnoxious hard plastic that you can barely cut with sizzors, it was light plastic and popped open easily, which is a big plus!A few years ago I bought a similar item, with \'built in shaving lotion\' but it was bulker and I didnt like it, it really didnt do the job, without adding shaving cream.I was expecting a nice clean shave with this razor but I was also expecting to have to use my own shaving lotion.I followed directions and it worked very nicely. The lotion on the razor was very nice and protected my skin and I was left with a very smooth shave, just like you would expect with Venus razor. Although, I liked this product, I would probably just stick with the regular Venus cartridges and stick with my regular shaving lotion.    "

I also have to use a regular toothbrush or my circular oral-b to get tight, hard to reach places. NOTE AMAZON\'S RETURN POLICY!! you have only thirty days and technically they dont have to issue a refund on a personal care item, particularly if it has been used! if you use it and determine you dont like it and initiate a return all within the thirty days they will probably only give you back 50% or not accept the return at all. if you buy it from that wharehouse store or a standard store with a good return policy, they will take it back no questions asked anywhere from 60 days to a year later."

What more is there?I\'d also like to point out that you can get WAY more mileage out of these things then Gillette wants you to know.  The blue indicator stripe fades after a few shaves, but I generally reuse mine for two or three months before I need to replace it (shaving once every other day).  I NEVER get cut, and I NEVER get razor burn.    "

1327,907,934,20111205,B000XVSNTQ,5,"December 5, 2011",A3EADWE0F3A1J6,Amazing!,"First I have to commend Venus on there packaging. We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs. I love it!    "

Like the Smart Guide/Clock timer because I used to walk around the house for the two minutes until the pulse timer went off so I never knew if I was missing spots - now I stay pretty much on track. It is a little confusing at first but it\'s not really difficult to use. I\'m not exactly a rocket scientist so if I can do it anyone can.  There are a number of things that you have to learn and get used to and decide what the most comfortable settings are for you.  I will get a couple of the recommended brushes, especially the \'floss\' brush.  They are fairly expensive but I think they last a long time.  The unit is a tad heavy in comparison to my old Oral B, but it didn\'t take long to get use to.  I think my teeth look brighter and feel cleaner than with any other brush I\'ve ever used.  Hope my dentist agrees!!!"

It is simply a hard edge of the blade housing.Upon using a fresh, clean, new cartridge, it feels like running a rusty can across your skin: scratchy, irritating, cheap.THESE ARE NOT GILETTE.I am seeking what further steps I can take to hold Amazon, LLC accountable for selling me a fake item that poses a risk to my health.

I need a deodorant that will go on dry and comfortable, but one that will also go on clear, and not stain darker clothing.With their Clear Shield line, Gillette does just that.To put it simply, Gillette\'s product gets the job done. It goes on dry and clear, and gives long-lasting odor protection that lasts all day. I put this on every morning before work, and several hours later when I get home, it\'s still working for me.If there\'s one negative (and from what I can tell, other reviewers will back me up on this), it\'s that the scent is a bit too \'sweet.\' It\'s almost as if Gillette was trying to create a product men and women alike could comfortably use - and in that aspect, the end result is questionable. They really need to get more scents out, and specific ones for men and women, not one that\'s just a compromise.Negatives considered, this is still a top-notch product. It goes on dry and clear and gives long-lasting odor protection. It\'s still more than good enough to earn this reviewer\'s recommendation.    "

But I like the way the head floats on the Turbo system. I shave right after I shower so my beard is soft. As a result I usually get about 15 to 20 shaves per blade. With the one and two blades systems I use to get 15 to 16 shaves per blade. Before they start to pull and get uncomfortable to use.    "

This brush does a great job of thoroughly cleaning your teeth w/o hurting your gums.  The timer that directs you to switch from one quadrant to another, every thirty seconds is a good reminder.  And the red light that flashes when too much pressure is applied is quite handy.In addition to switching my toothbrush, I also changed my toothpaste to Jason\'s Healthy Mouth.  After using the new toothbrush & toothpaste for approximately three months, I visited my Hygienist for a cleaning.  Unprompted, she told me that I had the healthiest teeth/gums of any of her patients.  And that assessment still holds true after almost two years.One last note:  If you\'ve got a youngster who needs to learn to brush all quadrants w/o applying too much pressure, purchase an extra toothbrush head and let your child give it a try.  It worked for my guy."

Underneath my unfortunately tough & wiry facial hair is very soft & sensitive skin prone to redness, nicks and the whole gamut of after-shave horrors.

2002,1582,1634,20090428,B001JQLNFA,3,"April 28, 2009",A2VZP50FSYD6CO,Unique Razor,"Venus Spa Breeze Razor has a unique feature - shave gel bars at the top and bottom of the razor that eliminate the need for shaving cream. It comes with a handle and two razor cartridges. The razor handle will hold all Venus razor cartridges, not just the Spa Breeze ones. The entire package was very easy to open and the razor handle and cartridges come in a nice waterproof container that can be stored in the shower, although it\'s not all that sturdy. The package comes with a bracket so you can hang the razor in the shower, however, I couldn\'t figure out how to use it. While the razor cartridge packages are conveniently waterproof, I had a hard time opening them and ended up having to use scissors, which damaged the shaving gel bar a bit.The Venus Spa Breeze Razor was just okay. I love the fact that there is a scratch and sniff panel on the front of the package so you can smell the shaving gel to see if you like the odor and the white tea scent was very pleasant. You need to be careful how you store the razor in the shower especially if you can\'t figure out how to hang it - put the razor face down and the shave gel bars are activated and the razor becomes messy to use. The handle fits pleasantly into the hand and the cartridges snap on and off quite easily. The shaving gel bars are a unique feature and work quite well, but don\'t expect lather like from regular shaving cream. The razor provides a nice smooth shave although I did knick myself a bit, causing my leg to bleed.Venus Spa Breeze Razor is an interesting concept that is perfect for people that may be traveling and don\'t want to pack shaving cream. However, I\'m not sure how long the shave gel bars last, which makes me a bit wary. In the end, I prefer regular razors and shaving cream.    "

I bought this from Walmart. Very strange, indeed. This has never happened before. Is the Mach 3 supposed to be dull for a faster shape? maybe they used dull blades so people can shave fast without cuts? Or I just got a bad package.I decided to go ahead and do this review for amazon because I saw there were a lot of reports of dull blades upon purchase. I just want to let people know that I was one of them, but mine are definitely real. It seems possible that Gillette may be letting go of some of their quality.    "

637,217,225,20090316,B0001LQGEM,3,"March 16, 2009",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,Average performance,"After using this razor for a short period of time, I feel compelled to tell others how it stacks up in the world of razors. With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one. The cartridges are still available in some stores, however. This review specifically covers the Sensor3 cartridge system.Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor3. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Sensor3 cartridges are noticeably smaller than the Mach 3 cartridges, by comparison. The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.The shave: 3 stars. I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving. I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days\' facial hair growth. The angle of the blade takes some getting used to. I noticed several times that I placed the blade on my face at the wrong angle, presumably because of my adjustment to the Mach 3/Fusion/Quattro razors which seem to have a more linear handle design. The biggest problem I encountered were several cuts. Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors. I do note that the shave was close, but comfort was lacking.Durability: 3 stars. This is the durability rating I give to the Sensor3 disposables. I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges. Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.Overall: The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable). For razor systems, one would be advised to choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.    "

I have been using Fusion Blades since they have been on the market and my face told me with the first stroke that the blades were counterfeit.  A convenience store cheapo throw-away blade is a lot sharper.  A few years ago I was given a web page that I could buy this type blade at a discount price.  They too were counterfeit.  I realise that you have to be skeptical when buying on the internet, but I trusted Amazon to have checked their vendors out.  What is most aggravating is there was no deal in the price. I could have went to the nearest Walmart and bought for the same price when adding the cost of fuel for the round trip.......    "

Changing the angles of the blades and adding 2 extra, it seemed slightly ridiculous, what was next 15 blades?  But upon using the 5 blade wonder from Gillette I quickly found that the hype was worthwhile and the end result was the greatest shave I had ever gotten.  Smoother, quicker, and with less irritation then I ever had before.  I tried going back to the Mach 3 but it was impossible, the stakes had been raised.  It was only a matter of time before a womens razor with 5 blades would be released, could the magic happen again?You bet it could.Being in martial arts I found the benefits of shaving areas that men don\'t usually shave as opposed to staying hairy all over (go ahead and insert your metro sexual jokes here) and have used a womens razor for years so I know what I am talking about.  With the edition of the lubricant outer edge, the aforementioned 5 blades, a comfortable grip and a shaving station to put your razor back, this newest invention by Gillette truly is a work of art.  Razor burn is a thing of the past and irritation has been sent out to pasture as well.  My wife loves the quality of this new razor and her legs lasted smoother longer.This is one of those cases where once you try you can\'t go back.  The new Venus Embrace is a lights out home run of a product that exceptional.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION    "

That may be true in some instances, but what I didn\'t realize until I tried this toothbrush was that most people probably love their electric toothbrushes because they work so much better than a traditional toothbrush.  I\'m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that \'just came from the dentist\' clean feeling.I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in \'timer\' that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  I don\'t think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you\'re done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush, I purchased five heads for the price of 3 of the brand-name ones.The only feature I don\'t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you\'re using too much pressure when you brush.  I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on, I can\'t imagine most people normally brush that hard.  So for me this was not a necessary option, it\'s just there though and doesn\'t interfere with the use of the brush in any way.I only wish I had discovered the ease and pleasure of having such clean teeth earlier - I definitely recommend this brush!"

And after owning it for a month or two now, it\'s definately a good trimmer to be battery powered, but not great as it is advertised.  First I\'ll list the pros...ProsGreat for shaving-With the fusion proglide heads, this razor is awesome.  It has the same quality, but better since it has the higher quality handle.  I threw away my old proglide handle in favor of this sleeker and more efficent design.  As far as the face shaving aspect of this product, it\'s excellent.Great for trimming your facial hair-Another aspect where the Styler is excellent.  I\'ve used it to trim my goatee and sideburns quite a few times, and it gives an even and effective trim.  Plus, it\'s the original reason I bought the Styler, since my Phillips Norelco beard trimmer cut and trimmed my facial hair unevenly.  With this though, trimming is very fast and simple.  I also like how the trimmer comes with three length combs, making it easy when I decide to grow a beard and blend my goatee with interchangable trimmer combs.  When trimming my goatee, I used the 3 guide comb, which is perfect for trimming the length on shaggy hair without completely oblitterating my goatee.  Then, when I wanna grow my beard out, I used the 1 guide comb to blend my goatee in with my stubble.The razor comes complete with a stand to hold everything-I couldn\'t believe for $20, I got a razor/trimmer/attachment combs/tray.  The tray that comes inside the packaging means your bathroom will be more organized than using traditional razors or trimmers.  It\'s also smart the way the tray has 3 openings in the back for each guide comb and one opening in the top for the fusion head attachment to rest in.  And the fusion attachment head is built efficently, since it has an attachment that fits neatly on top of the trimmer head.  It also looks cooler and makes storage easy and effective.Now onto the cons...ConsNot great for lining facial hair-While this trimmer is perfect for trimming facial hair and shaving, it\'s not great at lining a beard, sideburns or goatee.  This actually surprized me, since the Gillette campaign in the advertisements claims it\'s great for lining and detailing.  Specifically showing in the commercials how supposedly great it is in detailing and lining facial hair.  In that department, it\'s a bit of a disappointment, but I\'ve never found any cartridge razor that can line as well as a disposable razor, and this is no exception.  And as far as the edger is concerned, the few times I\'ve tried lining with it, it never did a phenominal job, more like mediocre at best, since in most instances I wound up using a disposable razor to correct it.Doesn\'t have a long battery life-Not really too surprizing here, since I\'m kind of OCD when it comes to keeping my facial hair looking neat.  Plus, I have used it more often than just on my face, thus a partial reason why the battery isn\'t lasting very long.  I\'d say the average battery life of the Styler would be a month if not used for body hair or any other non facial detailing purpose.  Since it\'s so efficent though, this isn\'t a major issue for me.  Others might see it that way however, since batteries are kind of costly to replace.Not great for use on body hair or lining the back of your neck-I really don\'t consider these two areas major issues, since the Styler is only intended for face use anyway.  I feel though that I must point out for those who think this might be great for trimming body hair or good for lining your neck in between barber visits, this isn\'t the tool for either purpose.  With this being a battery controlled trimmer, it\'d take you forever to use on body hair.  Plus, to me using something on your body hair that\'s intended for your face is kind of cross contaminating anyway.  I initially thought I might be able to use this for lining my neck hair in between trims, but this won\'t leave an even cut or line.  Something my old beard trimmer could do, but again not a big deal to me, since this product is for facial shaving and maintenance.Overall, I rate this 4 out of 5 stars since it\'s great at shaving and trimming facial hair.  Really, for about $20 bucks, this Styler is a quality invcstment for any guy.  It can do most things a beard trimmer can at half the cost(not counting the cheapo pieces of crap trimmers).  I wish this thing was rechargable, then it would be darn near perfect.  If you\'re expecting to be using this for any other purpose than facial hair, you might want to invest in a good body hair trimmer or hair clipper set instead.  Otherwise though, I have been happy with this purchase and would buy another set once it needed replacing.    "

When I bought the M3Power, I assumed that I would never feel the urge to buy another razor because it had 3 blades (seemed like plenty) and had the power component, so what else was there?But then I started hearing about the Fusion and I read these Amazon reviews, and I decided to take the plunge and give it a shot (oh how I miss the days when they used to send the Mach3 free in the mail!). Costco has a nice deal where it is $18 for the Fusion Power with 4 blades (and handle) so I should be set for some time. I used each M3Power blade for at least a couple months without incident so the same should be true for the Fusion. I remember when the Mach3 first came out and it was recommended to change the blade every 3 months, but now because of that Aloe strip, they only last 3 uses? To me that is nonsense and wasteful as the blades themselves work just fine down the road and so do the microfins which IMHO work fine even if there is no more Aloe left!Anyway, I couldn\'t wait to have my first shave with the Fusion, and I couldn\'t believe how fast I was finished shaving my whole face! Because the blades are closer together, it felt as though I was shaving with barely even one blade, and I did not find that hairs got stuck between them which was my only concern with the design. With the power turned on, the razor went smoothly across my face, and I barely felt anything which is really what one wants when shaving. I personally don\'t like to go against the grain on my neck, but the Fusion did a decent job going with the grain so I was most pleased. The single blade on the back was nice for evening out sideburn hair and getting at those pesky under-nose hairs. Lastly I felt as though the pivot motion of the blade head was even more forgiving than the predecessors which made the transition between shaving my face and shaving my neck hair even smoother.The only gripes I have are its cost, but that\'s obviously a supply/demand issue, and its color which is orange and quite bright. I like the blue of the Manual Fusion better, but I like the power that I get from the Power Fusion, and since color is superficial, it is hardly a big point of concern. I just wonder if Gillette intended this color to displease people so they will be enticed when they come out with the Fusion \'Nitro\' or some other color scheme!Still this is the BEST razor on the market and worthy of a buy if you are like me and don\'t go through a razor head every week.

There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17 (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)What worries me about this listing is that it claims to be the Extrasoft EB17, but the picture of the item shows the Flexisoft EB17.  Be warned, Amazon might be confused about this item and selling it incorrectly labeled.  On the Extrasoft EB17, all the bristles around the outside edge are the same color.  If you\'re looking for Extrasoft, make sure you find an item where the picture matches the description."

In theory, it\'s a great idea: it\'s difficult to get sharp symmetrical lines using an ordinary razor, and one would think a single blade would do the trick a lot better. In practice, though, this doesn\'t work. In the first place, either the blade isn\'t sharp enough or it\'s burried too deep inside the cartridge to be truly precise. And secondly, whatever hairs it trims just get stuck in the blade - and it\'s a real pain to get them out.The good. Fusion isn\'t worse than Mach3. This was actually a great relief following the disappointment of M3Power which was a disaster. I can\'t say yet if Fusion gives a superior shave to Mach3 Turbo, but it stands to reason that five blades would perform better than three.    "

I had a similar styler, but the blades were dull and a pain to groom myself with. It\'s quick, fast and easy to use, helping you to always look your best with all your quick grooming needs.For as cheap as the Gillette styler was, it sure is my new favorite tool to groom with! It\'s got a lot of nice features that more expensive stylers have, but for around only $20, plus it\'s water proof for use in the shower! First off let\'s start with the fact that it uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges, how amazing is that? I can now toss out my old fusion power pro-glide handle since this one works even better. The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates just as well, if not better than the standard power handles on the disposable shavers.The handle is nicely molded, very clean look and provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not hard plastic, so you won\'t find yourself dropping the styler or having it slip out of your palms. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding.You can use the standard motorized blade directly on your skin without worrying about cutting yourself, or scratching up your skin. It\'s sharp, but only for your hair. It also includes 3 different style \'combs\' to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you\'d want to trim. With all these little plastic attachments here and there though, you\'ll need a place to store it all! Gillette is two steps ahead of you, because the packing it comes in also doubles as a stand and accessory holder for the styler itself, and all the little attachments included.One nice thing not many shavers or stylers have is the ability to open the compartment behind the blade to clean out hair that can cause jams. The Gillette styler has a hatch you can pop off, and snap right back down to clean out any hair or gunk so your styler never jams, and will always work reliably. This is a huge plus for me since my old one was becoming weak and dull from all the hair trapped in the mechanism slowing down the blade and motor.Besides the styler and the accessories, I received Gillette brand cooling lotion to use after shaving, and non burning shaving gel. I tried both, and liked them very much. The shaving gel made my hairs pirk right up after a few seconds, making shaving so much easier. I felt no burn or sting while using the gel, so it really does work. Afterwards I put some of the lotion into my palms and rubbed it onto my face where I had shaved, it did have a nice cooling effect, but I could have lived without the lotion, it has a nice light scent to it too.For under $20, the Gillette Styler really can\'t be beat. It\'s cheap in price, high quality, comes with tons of accessories and samples, and it does a good job. It would make a great gift to any guy you know, or a gift to yourself!    "

I don\'t get the impression this is even a sonic toothbrush.  Sure, it vibrates and scrubs, but I don\'t detect that sonic pulse implied by the name \'Pulsonic\'.  It seems like I\'m getting the same results as I could get with a regular 2 dollar brush.I\'m returning this and spending a few dollars more for a heftier sonic toothbrush.  This one just wasn\'t worth it."

I have sensitive teeth at the gum line and my dentist said that the \'sonic\' action irritates the sensitivity and to use only once a day (use regular toothbrush on other brushings).  I like using electric toothbrushes because I have forearm and elbow pain from the manual tooth brushing up and down action. Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms. I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  The negative reviews I read seemed like they were isolated instances of the toothbrush going out shortly after purchase, and was not the \'norm.\'  I thought that if I ended up with a \'bad egg\' toothbrush, Amazon would replace easily (as stated in some reviews I read).  I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  And surprisingly, the little \'rubber pieces\' that act as \'floss action\' actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums feel great and look clean after brushing.  Some other bonus items I liked about this product: came with 2 brush heads, so won\'t need to replace heads for at least 6 months; also liked the 2 minute timer alert, but not shutting off so I can finish brushing when I chose to turn it off. I would recommend this toothbrush as a mid-level electric toothbrush, where you don\'t have to buy replacement batteries, yet don\'t value the \'upgrade\' pressure sensing, sonic, covered brush head, multiple handles, etc. of the high-level electric toothbrushes."

At the time, the price was about $18 or so and I thought that was a great deal since these razors usually retail much higher.The razors showed up and I noticed a number of particular differences between my used old blades (bought from a supermarket). First the blade seemed a bit dull and dry when I shaved using the first blade in the package. It was so bad I had to throw it out immediately and tried the second..And then a third blade, etc..Needless to say ALL the blades were terrible..ALL THE BLADES! I found it strange that out of 16 blades, I wasn\'t even able to get one good shave and had to go buy the blades at full retail cost in person at a supermarket, and use my old turbo blade in the meantime. Another thing I noticed was the blue strip seemed to be made out of plastic and was not lubricating.Today is July 18, 2010 and I was thinking of buying some blades since I ran out and the price seems pretty reasonable...But then I noticed many reviews here with zero stars and talk of fakes.. Looks like I wasn\'t the only one.I am not sure where these reviewers bought their blades from (Marketplace or directly from Amazon) but I can say this:I bought my blades directly from Amazon, its a verified purchase and after reading the reviews here I think they sold me fakes.Thanks Amazon..Check your suppliers.

That is, you need to apply this at bedtime in order for it to work optimally.  The package insert explains why -- applying the product before you sleep allows it to \'form better plugs\' -- which, while disgusting-sounding, is how antiperspirants tend to work -- the aluminum compound plugs and temporarily deactivates your sweat glands.  So your armpits will also feel kindof nasty and coated when you go to wash them next, but so it goes with this type of product.  The package insert also explains that the aluminum compound in this particular product is different from that used in most antiperspirants, and that it allows for less irritation and better performance -- I can\'t really speak to the accuracy of those claims as I\'ve never experienced irritation or problems with other brands.The scent of the product is mild, and quite unisex.Overall, this product does what it says if you follow directions -- but I\'m not sure I\'ll use regularly as I\'m not fond of the way it makes my underarms feel.

But lately, I\'ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \'bristles\' and how they\'d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I\'d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I\'ll be certain to purchase this model again.

As a matter of fact, they seemed to do a slightly worse job than my 3-blade Venus.The biggest change - and the reason I won\'t be changing to this version - is the moisturizing pad around the blades.

It has 2 speeds, a charger base, a regular brush head and a small head to do in between teeth. It is a very nice design and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because it doesn\'t sit firmly in the base and is easy to knock it out of the base, it wobbles when bumped lightly. I also feel the brush head could be slightly smaller but the size is OK, I just like the smaller brush heads. It says the charge will last for about 4 hours which is good since brushing teeth only takes about 2 minutes. This is a very nice pulsing toothbrush for a little less money than some that works well.

The stand comes with 4 compartments to store the brushheads, as well as the charger stand.

I go between the two as far as replacement blades and whichever is on sale. They are pretty similar, and either of the blades actually fit on either the razors.I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago. I have since tried a few new models thinking that perhaps one of these new razors might work better... but I keep coming back to this razor.The Mach 3 is so far, the only replaceable blade razor that I have found I can easily, properly shave my head without nicks and cuts. The blades tend to wear fairly quickly compared with the Shick Hydro 5, but what is the use of longer lasting blades that slice my head to ribbons?The grip is a great improvement on the Sensor XL, more heft, better wet grip. The blades are easy to attach and remove. They last me a couple of weeks on average, but I shave my head every two to three days and shave my neck below my beard every day. That\'s a lot of use.I did start using a new shave gel and it works magically with the razor. No more issues with serious gumming up of the blades. Check out King of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.. It\'s expensive for a shave gel, but nothing works better for shaving my head and preventing the shave gel/cream from gumming the blades.I know the replacement blades are expensive, and many third party sellers are reselling stolen merchandise... but that\'s part of why they are expensive. Those of us who are buying the blades on the up and up are paying for all those stolen and re-sold packages. So I just recommend buying from a store or trusted seller rather than eBay. Also watch for replacement blades not sold in retail packaging. Often these are either knock offs or have \'fallen off a truck\'. Spend the extra $5 and make sure you are getting the quality blades from a reliable source.    "

I\'ve always had a problem with being, shall we say... extra juicy. :) So, pantyliners are a staple item at my house. When it came down to choosing between Always & Carefree, a quick whiff of the package determined the clear winner. Carefree possessed an awful, overpowering floral scent that made me want to gag. It was the same stench that I had detected in many public restrooms, combined with *other* odors I dare not mention. OTOH, Always had a fresh, light, clean scent that was not the least bit cloying. Always is like a gentle breeze, whereas Carefree is comparable to a full-blown F5 tornado... with the lifeless carcasses of a few livestock caught up in the funnel. Always is simply the best choice for any woman/girl who seeks good absorption combined with a *slight* fragrance. The problem with highly-scented pantyliners is that, when combined with bodily fluids, they emit some extremely revolting fumes (exactly what I smelt in the public restrooms). Besides, who wants a pantyliner that will undermine your perfume? Who wants to hear \'Hey, what\'s that smell coming from your crotch\'? This will never be a problem with Always. But, scent factor aside, I also love these because they are thin, stay in place reasonably well (with the exception of profuse sweating), absorb a moderate amount of moisture... and I really dig the light blue wrappers (I hate pink; another reason why I\'m put-off by Carefree). :PConclusion: These pantyliners rule. Stock up before I buy them all."

Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven\'t so much as gotten a nick.  I\'ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  While I haven\'t attempted to use the razor without shaving cream, as the claims say you can (I have dry/sensitive skin that I feared would not react well), I will say that I think the skin of my legs gets less dry with this razor and I almost didn\'t need body lotion afterward.The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  The razor comes with a case that I believe is intended to adhere to the wall of your shower, with storage for razor blades, which come individually packaged.  I don\'t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can\'t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.The only downside - and one that isn\'t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.  If only you could use the blade to shave the price!  That said, this product is so good that if you\'re trying to select between comparably priced razors/blades from competitors, I strongly recommend you try this one - I think you\'ll be pleased in every way.

The problem is, however, that it\'s not realistic.  Sure, I can get used to applying deodorant on at night.  But can I get used to NOT scrubbing underneath my arms during my morning shower?  Ummm...no.I tried the unscented kind, which was fine - literally no scent.  I experienced no irritation or any other kind of side effect from it.I ended up being slightly drier, but still sweaty using the Gillette.  I\'m sure everyone is different, and maybe I\'m a profuse sweater, but it just didn\'t work enough for me to justify the premium (costs over twice what I normally get for marginal results).It might be worth a shot if you\'re desperately looking for a solution to underarm perspiration.  It\'s certainly a cheaper alternative than paying for $700 Botox injections every 6 months.  But don\'t expect this to be the answer to your prayers.  At least for me, it certainly wasn\'t.    "

She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself. I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode."

It has a feature of three speeds which is very nice. when first turned on it is a regular speed, when the button is pressed again it goes to a slower speed designed for sensitive, when the button is pressed the third time it is a combination of regular and slow speed alternating radidly between the two.

Oral-B also makes the 1000 series model.  There\'s nothing wrong with this I am sure, however I believe it doesn\'t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  The only downfall is that about once a week you do have to charge the battery (which does take about 17 hours).  Honestly, that\'s not a big deal.  The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  It has room for additional brush heads.  It\'s a nice feature, but something I really don\'t find the need for.  Overall, those are minor things.  I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains."

In this case, the product produce frizziness in both hot humid New Jersey weather and in hot dry New Mexico weather.As a result, we both tend to stick with the same conditioner and work around any problems that local conditions produce.

I then bought the oral B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush, used it for about a month, and stopped. From then on I stayed using the man�al brush and was silent for about 3 years.

The little rubbery fins seem to keep the head moving at a good pace with no problems so far.  It is flat and hugs the skin well and seems to rotate well without difficulty.I will keep using it and testing it, but I am not sure how expensive the replacement blades are- that is often the problem.  So many times the replacement blades are more expensive than the original razor or close to it.The handle was easy to hold on to despite soapy wet hands.  The wall unit  stayed up well so far on my fiberglass shower wall- it has two suction cups which seems a bit better than other ones I have tried with only one.The extra blade pack stores inside which I like, although it has to be cut into with scissors to get at it, so having it in the shower helps to keep track of it, but not for opening when needed.  You have to get out of the shower to open it.All in all I really like this razor so far- I have used it twice on my legs and it has stayed sharp and effective, but I will edit if I can in the future to reflect any changes in my opinion of this as time goes on.

The main thing that made me purchase it was that it had an indicator (on the clock/timer) that let you know if you were brushing your teeth too hard. I was told by my dentist to stop brushing so hard (slightly receeding gumline) and this toothbrush has helped me tremendously. My teeth have never felt more clean and I am no longer having sensitivity issues. It makes me feel like I have just had a cleaning at the dental office. It seems a bit pricey at first but I have always been able to find the brushheads cheaper than manual toothbrushes so it makes up for it in the long run. I highly recommend using the sensitive brushhead if you have sensitive teeth and receeding gums. This toothbrush is amazing, try it!"

This three bladed shaver glides easily, works well over sharp angles and with its built in shaving soap is the perfect touch up razor before a quick run to the pool.I mounted the included razor case (using the material provided) to the left of the shower head and keep it there in its holder. So far I\'ve managed four shaves off of one blade and I anticipate more.  The blades come in sealed containers so you don\'t have to worry about the unused ones becoming soggy in the case.The gel soap bars that frame each side of the head are holding up well and also serve to keep the razor from \'digging\' and \'snagging\' like my earlier purchase.

I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor. Felt great. Best shave ever. This did everyting that the Pro glide promised to do. I had no irritation of the skin and the shave was very comfortable and close.I would NOT recommend this razor at all.

All I used was the floss action brush head.After using the Oral B continually for about 3 months, I can say that the (oral B) delivers a much more powerful clean. Though the Sonicare was easier to reach the back teeth.  Both delivers a clean, smooth just left the dentist feeling.This thing is way thicker then my old Sonicare E series handle, the pictures on amazon don\'t show the side shots.  And compared to the latest and greatest sonicare, it\'s probably double the thickness.  Go to your local retail store to compare, if thin is in for you.The smartguide clock thing is pretty heavy and thick as well, keep that in mind if you want to find some way of wall mounting it.  If you have it free standing on your sink its hard to read unless your eye level (I\'m 6 3) or stand back a foot or two.  And , although some of the back is rubberized, it won\'t lean against your wall without falling.  I use fun tack to overcome this.  It comes with two sets of AA batteries, which was pretty worrysome to me because most companies don\'t even give one set but it is still going strong.  It\'s neat to know how far in you\'ve brushed and when to switch quadrants, and the \'studder\' helps better then the audible sound the sonicare makes. Smartguide will count up and down for you.Brush heads seems much cheaper then my sonicare.  A 6 pack in my local warehouse club costs $30.  About $15 for a 3 pk on Amazon, and even cheaper with subscribe and save.It charges a bit quicker then my sonicare.  The charger base is really tiny, takes up very little room.  It even snaps into the included 4 user toothbrush tray.  However, even when it\'s done charging the wall wart (power brick thing) stays slightly warm (warmth=energy consumption), so I\'d advise you to unplug after charging.."

On my old Braun electric toothbrushes the head rotated and oscillated, on this toothbrush the head pulsates or vibrates.Is it any better? The shape of the toothbrush head seems better designed to fit the shape or your teeth, and it is larger than the old design, large enough to cover two teeth. But while the head is larger in surface area it is much slimmer in profile so it is much more comfortable to use, it feeling much smaller in the mouth. I also like the timer function, it has an overall two minute timer, but it gives a signal every 15 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth.I like this new toothbrush, it seems as efficient as the old style Braun but is much more comfortable to use, and it is a little quieter too. It is also much easier to clean their being no inner workings as on the old style heads, which I am sure must be much more hygienic too.As the toothbrush should run for a week on a single 14 hour charge it is not necessary to replace the toothbrush on the charger after every use, so the charger does not need to be in the bathroom. Using the toothbrush this way should prolong the the life of the rechargeable battery tooHowever, as yet their does not appear to be an Interspace toothbrush head (which I need to reach awkward spaces) available to fit the toothbrush, so at the moment I am using both the old, with the Interespace head, and the new. Hopefully Braun will produce an Interpsace head for this toothbrush."

I suppose there is a degree of subjectivity involved when you make a comparison with fresh blades. I remember that Consumer Reports was unimpressed with the vibrating Fusion when it came out, but I got one right away and liked it--even while aware that each \'improved\' razor came with ever-more expensive blades.Now there is the Fusion Proglide Power Razor. It makes claims of important improvements on what I would have thought was unimprovable--after all it is just a razor with a new generation (it claims) of blades.So the question is this: is there a positive difference?I read the information that came with the razor and on the web and was impressed by Gillette\'s audacity (for instance, a circuit board to keep an even flow of juice to the vibrator motor even as the battery runs down, and special groves to feed whiskers into the onrushing blades as the user draws the Fusion Proglide across a cheek!).I figured to keep it simple: fresh blades in my current Fusion and in the Fusion Proglide, one for each cheek; four down strokes over gel shaving cream on the left cheek for the Fusion and four more on the right for the Fusion Proglide. Little did my familiy know that my morning routine had become a major evaluation activity.Well, there is a difference. I like a smooth shave and this razor and blade gives the best shave that I\'ve come across outside of barbershop.I liked it and you might want to give it a try.    "

For less than a week I did have some gum sensitivity like they mention, but after that the pain and problems went away.  I\'m amazed at how much cleaner my mouth feels and looks.  My teeth whitened a little bit at first and the overall health of my mouth improved greatly.  I will never switch back to a traditional toothbrush, even though it\'s costlier for this one and the refills.  I figure I\'ll save much more than that in the long run and just the way my mouth feels now makes it worth the cost.  The box comes with everything you\'ll need.  It had two brush heads included, a traveling case and an okay looking case for the brush heads (I still prefer to keep them in my medicine cabinet).

From the first time I brushed with this Oral B 5000, I was astonished at how clean my teeth felt.  I honestly think they felt even cleaner than when I would have them cleaned at the dentist.  I even find myself brushing a third time some days, just for the great feeling.  My only disappointment with the unit is that I didn\'t clearly understand it only came with one brush head.  My husband utilized that Floss Head while I waited a few days for our set of 4 Precision Clean Brush Heads came in.  (I think that the floss head would have been too large for my mouth, so I did not order those for us.)  Using the simple Precision Clean heads, my mouth feels terrific.  While I have had gum problems in the past, I find less bleeding with this brush than my manual toothbrush which I had been using.  As some others have noted, my teeth are markedly whiter in perhaps only a week of use, with my usual whitening toothpaste I will add.  I do like the little remote timer.  I thought it more for my kids, but I truly like seeing the time rack up.  I now think I will be using the Deep Cleaning (3 minute) setting as I am never quite done with each quadrant before it beeps and pauses to alert me.  I am unsure how the whitening (pulsing mode) helps, but I use it after a full brushing, and it certainly isn\'t hurting.  My family of four is now happily using this unit.  I would recommend this without reservation."

I mean, it\'s a toothbrush after all. WRONG. Once you\'ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you\'ll never go back.Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  Always have.  Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  However, I went ahead and gave it a try.In less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  I put on the toothpaste and away I went.  The best thing is the size of the rotating head: it\'s about the size of a tooth.  Gee: what a novel idea! As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  This allowed me to work on my teeth while moving towards my gums.  In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.One of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth. This was something I could NEVER do with a regular toothbrush.  I also have some very deep pockets in my gums that have a tendency to hurt and bleed. However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  Oral-b is a reliable brand and this is in keeping with the brand recognition.  I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  It\'s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera! ;)"

The Venus created no problems at all, even after several uses. There was no irritation, no cuts, and nothing missed. Just total, smooth comfort.

But about a year ago I decided to test razors. Everything I could get my hands on. Even vintage razors from the early 20th century.I didn\'t want to like this razor.However, it along with its Mach 3 cousins are damn good razors. Easily the best I\'ve handled. And anybody that says it isn\'t is either crazy, or is being disingenuous.Are 5 blades really necessary (is a Cadillac necessary compared to a Dodge Neon)? Get what you pay for I guess.If you want the best, smoothest shave on planet earth with minimum irritation and you don\'t want to spend more time in the bathroom tending to your face than your wife? Then this is your razor.If you want to shave with a piece of flint, save a few bucks and thumb your nose at the system? Not my problem. Will lesser razors shave your face? Yep, especially if you like nicks, cuts, razor burn, multiple passes, shaving against the grain, re-shaving, $20 shaving creams, $80 shave brushes, pre-shave oils, soothing aftershaves, witch hazel, styptic sticks, hanging out on internet forums wondering what you\'re doing wrong, etc... And if you can find the economy in that, let me know.Did I mention this razors performance in more private areas? Nothing even comes close. And electric personal groomers are poor in performance by comparison.As for the cost, for me this is a non-issue. I can get months out of one cartridge relatively easily and with a little common sense that seems abundant out here in the woods, less so in the city. Therefore, this and other razors of its type (Mach 3 innovation) are no more expensive to me than a \'classic\' double edged razor which I have as well. It stays in the drawer mostly. But easily accessible if I suddenly need to go back in time, or remember why at one time why most men grew beards.    "

It has the dual heads that leave my mouth tasting fresh and clean and is far superior to the grocery store offering. To be sure it is much more expensive but the results, to me, are worth the extra cost. In addition to the dual head brush the timer is a nice touch and I have found that while it says the battery requires 16 hours to charge that apparently means to fully charge. I use the Vitality every morning and night during my travels and plug it in when checking into the motel room and find it always has an adequate charge.I agree with other reviewers that a travel case would be very handy as would a light indicating when the unit is charged. I am a bit worried about the battery used by OralB in this product after reading another reviewers comments as to the battery being of old technology and perhaps not as good as AA batteries.

It came with the 5000 handle, wireless display, charger, 2 FlossAction brush heads and a storage unit for brush heads.I was using the same Oral-B FlossAction brushheads with the 3D Excel, and I think the real technology is in the brushheads, so I was skeptical of the value from the 5000 handle. But when I brushed with it this morning I was really surprised by how much better this handle is from the 3D Excel. I also realized why I have been using electric toothbrushes; manual toothbrushes do not even come close. It felt like I went to the dentist. Absolutely worth the $50 I paid (after mail in rebate) including shipping. I still think the wireless display (Smart Guide) is a marketing gimmick, but I may be proven wrong over the next several weeks of use.I have not used the 3000, 4000 series or the Sonicare, but I would definitely recommend this over the 3D Excel handle and definitely over manual toothbrushes."

I don\'t want to smell like my deodorant, and the Cool Wave fragrance is very subtle. Also, my wife likes the smell, so that is an obvious plus!3) It seems to last longer than other brands including other gels. I tried AXE but found their clear gel to take more layers of application to work with the same effectiveness as Gillette.4) It doesn\'t degrade or melt when taken around in a gym bag. Over time some of the other gels I\'ve bought lose their texture or melt if they\'re not kept cool enough. I don\'t have that problem with Gillette. I can take it to the gym, leave it in my gym bag in a hot car all day long, and it still works perfectly later.Amazon sells these for a very reasonable price compared even with a place like SAMS, so if you like this deodorant, stock up and save some money.

A friend gave me this and I\'m actually shocked. Not ONLY could I easily floss my teeth, but within two weeks the inflammation(Known more commonly as gingivitis)was died down to a very manageable point, and within three it was practically completely gone.Crest and their entire line of \'Pro-Health\' items have been absolutely AMAZING for my teeth.

Shaves quick and clean, even \'against the grain\' on the sensitive areas like my upper lip.  No razor burn, not irritation.  The vibrating action of the blade really seems to help over the standard versions.  The non-vibrating blades, even the nicer ones, always leave razor burn if I shave against the grain, so I am forced to go with the grain even though it does not seem to be as close of a shave.  This blade allows me to shave the way I want to, without the irritation I get with other blades.Even has a cool blue light on the power button that lights up when its turned on, not sure what good its for as the razor vibrates so its hard to forget that its on, but its neat anyway.Blade refills are rather expensive, but that seems to be a fact of life now on all razors unless you choose to go with the one piece, single use type.I have used the same blade daily for about 2 weeks now, and it just started getting uncomfortable.  I can live with that.  For anyone who used shave gel or foam, you could probably go a bit longer.I can unconditionally recommend this blade.

One slow stroke across each section of skin with this razor was enough to clear out the hair with more precision than the SensorExcel could after 3 or 4 strokes.That is: a *new* SensorExcel blade in the same situation (4-5 days worth of hair) did worse and resulted in at least 3 cuts on average (whereas this blade resulted in no cuts). So clearly the new design helps. It does exactly what the ad says: spreads out the pressure of the cutting edges to reduce (eliminate in my case) the effect of your skin wrapping around the blade and causing cuts.But I believe you must use this blade SLOWLY. If you have the full face of hair like I did, that would be about 2 square inches per stroke, then wash. You can look into the blade and see very easily how full it is because with all those blades stacked so tightly together all the hair stays on the surface.This makes it easy to clean, too. Just run your thumb down the blades and you will easily unclog them. Compare this to the SensorExcel: once hairs were stuck in the abyss, they were usually there for good, requiring frequent blade changes. Hopefully this means the expensive blades will last longer (and thus prove to be worth the expense).This razor *is* an example of improvement via technology. I cannot agree that it is *revolutionary* but it is a good idea and it *is* the best razor design (I\'m comparing to double and triple razor designs, which I have used in the past). So it isn\'t the best on a revolutionary scale but it is the best.This razor\'s product execution was also an example of ridiculous marketing strategies gone over the top and if you want a laugh (or to be offended by the sheer obfuscation of information via distracting animations, interface, and sexual innuendo), I suggest checking out its website. The company could have made a greater profit had they foregone the ridiculously over-interfaced website because I doubt it convinced anyone. My first thought on entering was \'do I have to defeat the first boss before I can see their explanation for why a Power version of my razor is better?\' Along with the handle and cradle design, I would call it one of the most absurd and gaudy product executions I\'ve ever seen.However, the company luckily stumbled upon the best razor design in the process.

Absolutely the best razor and blade combination ever conceived by man. Some may complain about the price, but as in most things in life, you get what you pay for.    "

We both used this right after a shower and spent the whole day in the hot sun of florida working on the garden. By noon we both noticed we were getting rather fragrant and not in a good way. He kept trying it during the week while working in the very hot sun and by the fourth day of giving it every chance to work (using daily applications) he went back to his old Mitchum. I also tried it for a few more days and even spending the day in AC it wasn\'t working at all by late afternoon. I also went back to my old suave which works great for me. Another problem with this product is that the knob breaks easily if turned in the opposite direction so keep that in mind if you are brave enough to give this a try. This is the kind of applicator that you have to at first turn the knob for an eternity till the stuff squishes out of the tiny holes on the applicator.

Since I have a unisex name,  I occasionally get men\'s products. Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it. I\'ve never used a razor with the vibrating feature on it before, but I found this great for my legs, especially my knees and ankles. I\'ve NEVER cut myself using this blade, because with the vibration turned on, it\'s pretty much impossible for me to press down too hard. It doesn\'t vibrate too much to where it\'s noisy or annoying.As far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth. I can go 2-3 days between shaves, and when my hair starts to regrow, the hair is finer and not as \'stubbly.\' I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I\'ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus. I also love that this works so well on my underarms. Because it\'s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I\'ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before. This shaves super close without cutting or razor burn. And my legs are smooth ALL day, even if I shave at 8 in the morning. They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night. Ladies, you know what I\'m talking about.I haven\'t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy. The blades seem to last a while, at least 3-4 weeks shaving every other day or so. However, when they go dull, they go dull quickly.The only things I didn\'t like about this razor: one, it didn\'t come with a blade refill, like every other razor I\'ve ever bought, so that was kind of annoying. Also, the refills are expensive. Don\'t buy the \'power\' refills if you don\'t use the trimmer- that\'s the only difference between the \'power\' blades and the \'manual\' blades, and there\'s a dollar difference between the two. I don\'t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out that it\'s just an exposed blade on the opposite side, but I can see how men might find it useful.Overall, this is my favorite razor. I bought the refills even though they were expensive, and will probably be sticking with this for a long time.    "

At first I thought it was crazy to spend about $120.00 on a toothbrush, but I\'m glad I did. I was probably like alot of you who used the regular toothbrushes that only cost about $3.00 or so.  About a month ago my dentist asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  Told him just a plain jane toothbrush which I switch out every 3 months or so.  He recommended that I purchase an electric one because he\'s a firm believer in them.  He told me what kind he had, which was the Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable made by Oral-B.  He said there are several different price ranges, styles, and brands.  One of the many features I like on mine is the wireless SmartGuide which has a personalizing timer on it.  This helps you brush all four quadrants of your mouth equally. 5 brushing modes- Daily Clean, Sensative, Massage, Whitening, and Deep Clean.  It also has an idicator that lights up when too much pressure is being applied, this is a great feature because I was brushing too hard with my regular toothbrush which caused my gums to bleed.  Since I\'ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 I haven\'t had any problems with it, no bleeding gums, and my teeth feel as though I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  If there is a Con it would be that I had to purchase the precision clean head seperately because it only comes with the floss action and ProWhite heads.  However you also get a 5.00 off coupon to save money on your additional heads you might purchase.  Over all I\'m more than happy with the product and Amazon.com didn\'t waste anytime getting it sent to me.  I hope this helps any possible future buyers. Semper FI"

5589,2416,2472,20100603,B002HWS9GG,3,"June 3, 2010",A1T50IO1EMVNFH,From Sonicare to OralB,"I have been a Sonicare user for the previous 15 years. As a dentaphobe, I will always be grateful to Sonicare for keeping my mouth cavity free for my 7 year hiatus from the dentist- though to be fair, I also drank mostly water (vs. sugared drinks) and made sure to brush and floss twice daily, chewing sugarless gum throughout the day. Still, I found the Oral B a very nice upgrade for several reasons:1. NO ICKYNESS IN THE BRUSH HEAD!!! Sonicare brushes are notorious for getting all this disgusting gunk stuck up inside the brush head, leaving me with a sense of wonder about what exactly I was putting in my mouth, even after rinsing the head thoroughly in alcohol.2. Smaller brush heads. I finally feel like I am cleaning my wisdom teeth, which stick back almost to the uvula.3. Circular brush heads. Dentists always say to brush in circular motions, yet typical Sonicare brushes only go side to side.4. Using the floss-action head truly leaves less behind when I floss right after brushing.5. Another reviewer mentioned the fact Sonicare does not offer either soft bristled brushes or a sensitive mode.There were a couple downsides:1. Noise. The Oral B seems much louder, likely because the brush is moving in a circle vs. just side to side.2. Vibration Speed. One of Sonicare\'s main tenants for their brushes is that the sonic action itself gets rid of plaque/germs. The Oral B does not seem to vibrate quite as much- though flossing seems to yield fewer hangers-on, and does not just compact any recently-eaten food- such as cracker mush.There are other benefits, which Sonicare has also added to its latest greatest brushes, such as timers and better chargers. Still, I am happy with the switch- I\'ll just see if my dentist notices =)UPDATE; 2011- Going back to Sonicare.I had the brush about a year when the battery started dying ALL the time- would go from 3 of 4 bars to 0 bars in the middle of brushing. If you prefer leaving your brush plugged in all the time, this may not be a problem- but I like my batteries to hold some charge.Also, in the end, I do not feel like the brush is cleaning between the teeth as much as a Sonicare. Likely thanks to all the complainers like myself, I\'ve been exploring Amazon and noticing Sonicare has now created smaller brush heads with only the prong attachment/gotten rid of the ick factor of their bigger brush heads, and made the brushes overall less expensive (under $80).In the midst of the year\'s use, I sucked it up and returned to the dentist... to find I had 7 cavities =( While I obviously can\'t entirely blame the Oral B for this result, I again cite that the brush did not seem to clean as well between teeth/I miss the sonic action of the Sonicare- and did leave any late night cracker/chip remnants pushed down on my back teeth. So look for a new review of the latest Sonicare brush soon!"

928,508,518,20100714,B000BUUVTE,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.    "

At first, I was shocked.  This thing vibrates (like a buzz) your head when brushing the top teeth.  It is kind of like a dentist drill but much more dynamic.  It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \'dentist office\' cleaning.  After one week I have already seen the difference.  The company advertises two weeks, but one will show results.  It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  The bristles are somewhat hard without the slightest irritation to the gums.  Since this device uses NiCad batteries, I do not keep the charger plugged.  It has gone 2 weeks without need for recharging.  That is amazing.The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  The \'timer\' feature is great and is very useful.  The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  The tiny brush (floss head) supplied with it is useless.  I wish they would have placed an extra tooth brush in it\'s place.  The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  It is hardly bigger than a manual tooth brush.I very much recommend this tooth brush.  There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.  I question whether the costs difference would be worth it."

My hygieneist recommended the Oral B a while back and I took her advice.why I like my Oral B better:1- The heads are small and round like the dentist\'s equipment. It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than \'brushing\' like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).2- It\'s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.3- If it pops out of your mouth while it\'s running, it doesn\'t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.4- It doesn\'t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever? I was told my gums are in much better shape than before.6- It\'s cheaper.  \'nough said."

The first couple days using the Fusion were okay, but I immeadiately noticed I couldn\'t get as close a shave as with the Mach3. A lot of this is that the Fusion has a large surface area, so it\'s hard to do a lot of detail work, sort of like painting with a roller brush. The single blade on the back is supposed to compensate for this, but except for doing a mediocre job of cleaning up strays under my nose, the single blade was useless. The first Fusion cartridge gave up on me after about a week and left my face barely looked different before and after the shave. Even after replacing the cartridge, my face seemed to get used to the Fusion quickly and stubbornly refused to give me a good looking shave, no matter how many times I scraped those Fusion blades over my mug. I also found myself working harder to get the shaving gel and water off the Fusion between strokes, which is annoying.I should say that my face is a little weird in that the hairs grow very slowly but are very tough. I used to shave against the grain (up the face) for this reason but found I could get away with shaving with the grain using a Mach3 regularly. So, for people with softer facial hair, the story might be different.The one advantage I\'d give the Fusion is that it does tend to work best when you only use one stroke down an area, so for people who get easily irritated by multiple blade strokes over the same area, this could help.I switched back to a Mach3 blade this morning though, and couldn\'t be happier. I have a lot more control over the shave, it\'s cheaper to buy the cartridges, and in general it\'s just a better experience. It will be a sad day when/if Gillette drops their Mach3 line, probably in favor of some 9-bladed shaving monstrosity.    "

Use this product as part of the following regiment,"My best friend is in his final year as a dental student.  He recommended to me these following products:1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson & Johnson5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.This is the regiment he advised me to follow:1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it\'s the best time of day for using fluoride.3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \'glides\' right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \'grips\' the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it\'s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don\'t even think about it!5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don\'t have to wonder \'did I brush good enough\'. It tells you when you are done!CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.

The best part is that there is virtually no sign of irritation.For those who are having trouble using this razor against 2- or 3-day-old beards, just be patient and let the razor (and its vibrations) do the work.

It sounded like a perfectly good way to turn my face into a pepperoni pizza with extra EVERYTHING on it. The truth, however, is that this is a FANTASTIC product, and I now wish that I\'d bought one MUCH sooner.Random thoughts (since so much has already been said in the Amazon reviews here):1. I HATE shaving. I just frigging HATE it. I can never quite seem to get it just right, and I generally do end-up looking like something straight out of a Stephen King novel when I\'m done. THIS razor has actually changed that for me; I have yet to cut myself with this thing -- believe me when I tell you that (for me) that is really saying something -- and I honestly think that you\'d have to TRY to draw blood with this thing in order to do so.2. Thirty (plus) Dollars for a dozen replacement blades is absurd. (I do pay it, though. Because the shave IS that good.)3. The originally installed blade (usually) in products like these is a high-quality (pharmaceutical grade) titanium (this is true for almost everything sold in this retail space, by the way), and is designed to give you a fantastic first impression -- which it does. The originally installed (set of) blade(s) is an incredibly sharp, long-lasting set -- a finely-tuned, well-engineered piece of highly-toleranced machining that is designed to keep you coming back for more -- which means: buying replacement blades, and a LOT of them. That first, originally-installed set of blades is created to IMPRESS, and the real test of a concept (such as vibrating blades) really needs to be taken past the first usage, and deep into the experience of using replacement blades. I\'ve been using this for about a year, now... and the product continues to impress.4. Replacement blades, of course, are quite different than the originally installed blade -- but there is a simple method to make your replacement blades last much longer than they do, and it\'s this: spray some shower cleaner on the blades, and hang the razor upside down, so any moisture can drain away. The alcohol within the shower cleaner will pull the water away from the blades, and will keep it away. This will prevent the conditions that create rust on the actual blade(s) -- and without that chance to rust, your blades will last for weeks EACH.5. Shaving with a vibrating razor takes a bit of getting used to: you don\'t \'pull,\' but instead, you sort of let it \'drift.\' That\'s not exactly correct, but it\'s close enough. All you really need to do is to exert enough pressure to indicate the general direction of the stroke, and let the razor DRIFT at its own speed. You don\'t \'pull,\' and you don\'t force it. You let it drift.6. Use a good shaving gel, set-up a fogless mirror in the shower, and this thing will give you some incredibly close shaves as you stand under hot water. Take care of your blades with a bit of alcohol-based shower cleaner, hang the unit upside down so water can drain away, and this actually is a worthy investment -- even if they do charge $30 for a set of replacement blades.4 stars.Thirty Dollars for 12 replacement blades is NUTS.That\'s not even debatable.

Now that he switched over to this one, his face is REALLY much smoother. I mean a HUGE difference... not just a little bit! I certainly don\'t mind, it\'s definitely for my benefit (no more grizzly bear)! :)Now for my husband\'s take: Even when he hasn\'t shaved in a week, this razor blades gives a smooth cut the FIRST time through... no more going over the same area two or three times because he has been lax in his shaving! This thing REALLY works, and works fast, and gives the ultimate cut while it\'s at it!!!  Really, really nice! He also loves the detailed cutter on the top of the blade to get precision cutting... comes in real handy!Overall, we both recommend it hands down, and we will be tossing the old razors away for this one... and paying the extra for the refills on this one... it is most DEFINITELY worth it!

You know, when he gets the polisher out and rubs your teeth with it.  That is pretty much the same sensation you get with this brush.  I had to learn to not hold it against my teeth so hard because it was vibrating my entire head.I have to caveat.  I also own a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  To be honest, I think that the Sonicare feels better on my gums and also I think it does a better job overall.  HOWEVER, I hate my sonicare because of the way it grows mold.  The new sonicare models get your nasty toothpaste-spit mixture inside of the brush head where you can\'t see it growing mold.  Unless you actually unscrew the head and wash it out every day, and leave it taken apart to dry out, you will get mold inside your sonicare - and once that happens the brush pretty much smells like mold for the duration of its life (there may even be mold inside of the handle itself which I just cannot see without breaking it).This is not the case for the Oral-b Vitality.  The vitality features a snap-on type head which has no cracks to allow water to seep through.  The new sonicare features a flexible head, which I believe creates the problem with the mold (the old sonicares did not flex nor did they have the same mold problem).  The Viatlity head does not flex, it\'s just a straight snap-on piece with a rotating brush head at the top.Another thing I like about the Vitality is that it has changeable heads.  There are different heads which you can attach for different uses: Floss-Action, Pro White, and Dual Clean heads.  I use the Floss-Action and Pro White attachments - 2 minutes for each attachment.  The Floss action feels somewhat similar to a normal brush and gets all the stuff off your teeth, but the Pro-White has a weird yellow rubber thing in the middle of the bristles which rubs up against your teeth and whitens/polishes them.The Vitality also beats the sonicare in that it\'s brush heads come in packs of 3 for $20, whereas the sonicare offers packs of 2 for $20 (however, I believe the sonicare claims it lasts for 6 months and the vitality for 3).BATTERIES - the sonicare lasted about a month on a single charge - the Vitality only lasts about 2 weeks.That is all I can think of to put in this review.  The only reason I gave this brush 4 stars instead of five is because I wish it had more of a Sonicare vibration action - however it has an interesting rotating action which takes some getting used to.  The Vitality just doesn\'t feel like it cleans the gumline as well as the sonicare did - but at the same time it feels like it cleans the surface of the teeth better than the sonicare."

All types of mach 3\'s produce an equal shave which is at the same time, close and the blades clean out well under a hot tap. but the overriding factor that made me come back to them was the 7 variaties of handle to choose from, so now i can have a different razor for every day of the week which overall makes shaving everyday more tolerable. i dont personally believe in the micro-pulses of the m3 power but the vibrations themselves must enhance the the performance somehow. if your thinking of buying one of the mach 3\'s then go for it, as you won\'t be dissapointed.

I don\'t even stink of sweat, I just sweat out of my underarms alot.  Once a coworker even commented on it at my shirt and tie client facing job, recommending I change the brand of antiperspirant I use--but it wasn\'t like I didn\'t know I had this problem so it wasn\'t any more embarassing than the problem itself, now solved by great products like this one.  This not only helps me personally, but professionally as well.So I\'ve been using Degree prescription strength antiperspirant for about a year and a half now, and when the opportunity came up to try out a sample of this Gillette version I merely thought it would save me ten dollars.  Instead, I will be buying this from now on.What\'s the difference?  The active ingredient is the same and in the same amount--so one is just as effective as the other--and they both have moisturizers and such so that they don\'t irritate my underarms.  But the applicators are different in design and I have to say Gillette wins on this aspect alone.DESIGN / APPLICATOR: On the Degree product, the place on the applicator where the cream comes out is about the size of a quarter, whereas on the Gillette version it\'s wide enough to cover my entire underarm so I don\'t have to do circles with it to make sure I applied completely.  I believe this also causes me to use less of it, which makes it last longer and therefore is a better value.COMFORT: I noticed that with the Gillette product they seem to have put something in it that gives me a nice cooling sensation when I apply it.  It\'s very subtle, and very nice.  Degree, nor any other antiperspirant I\'ve ever tried, doesn\'t seem to have this.  I also feel the Gillette product is more comfortable.EFFECTIVENESS: As I wrote above, literally no difference in effectiveness between the Degree and Gillette products.  Same active ingredient, in the same amount.SCENT: The Gillette product that I sampled--the one on this page--has so little scent to it that we could say it practically has none.  It smells like and about as strong as Aveno moisturizer.  The Dove product, for comparison, smells really good, but not so strong that people notice it when you\'re near them.  I like the Gillette scent, or lack thereof, better.BOTTOM LINE: I didn\'t think this sample would cause me to change clinical strength antiperspirant from the brand I\'ve been using for years, but it did.  You should definitely try both and decide for yourself which one you prefer, but for me the clear winner is Gillette.    "

If it does what it says, I was finally ready.  I was tired of the electric razor, shaving my neck was always a difficult adventure, always had to pre-shave so that the hairs were not too long, or the electric would yank those hairs out!So I finally took the plunge, while out picking up a few things, I grabbed the Gillette Fusion Proglide, and took it home, hoping that it was as easy as it sounded.  Since shaving with a electric was a different animal, and I wasn\'t sure how to go about it, I checked out the Gillette site to find a nice video on pre-shaving rituals, and much more.So after dinner I went at it, this rookie prepped his skin and hairs, and foamed up with the gel that came with the razor.  I started slowly, and softly, and there was barely any feeling.  As I started to figure out how much pressure I could use, and what was the best direction to shave the parts of my face, it was a snap.The first shave took me as long as my electric, but I that\'s the first time rookie shave, it will, and did get easier as I went along.  It was sooooo easy to shave my neck, and absolutely no tugging, and didn\'t get a nick or cut.Being the first manual razor I\'d ever own, and being an absolute rookie at this, the Gillette Fusion Proglide was  the best shaving experience I\'d ever had, and I would recommend the razor to everyone!

Product Contains Heavy Perfume Scent.,"I am not a Pantene product user, however, I use a conditioner every day.  I was pleased with the results of the Pantene conditioner on my hair, but wish that Pantene didn\'t put so much perfume into this product.This Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Flat to Volume conditioner gives my layered, shoulder length hair a nice shine.  It doesn\'t leave a noticeable residue, so my hair also feels bouncy and light.The only negative is the conditioner\'s heavy perfume scent. The perfume scent is very strong out of the bottle, and lasts the entire day on my hair.  Some might consider this a nice thing, but for those who are scent sensitive, the heavy perfume scent is too much.  It is not a necessary component of the product, so I personally wish Pantene would make a non-scented version.4 stars because of the heavy perfume scent. It is so strong that I will not be a repeat user. "

The only difference I can see is the color. Oh I\'m sure Gillette spent big bucks to make the fusion power blades stand up to the imense stress and vibrations that occurs during the blades one week lifespan.Most likely they just think people are stupid enough to either want the color coordinated ones or that customers will think something bad will happen if you use the non-power version blades. Or people will think the power ones are better.  Bottom line: Gillette thinks you are gullible. Buy the non-power blades.The overall shave is good if you shave everyday. For longer growth the mach3 is better since you have a wider spacing between blades to avoid clogs.As with the mach3 power the vibrations seem to give a better shave: soothes the skin, helps unclog the blades, might lift hairs better.

It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on. Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth.

Sometimes I leave it curly, though, and for that, I need a good conditioner that leaves it looking curly and not frizzy. I thought this was worth a try. But I can\'t tell any difference between this conditioner and the myriad other Pantene conditioners... the single line of theirs that feels different from the others is the Restoratives line (which I love, and is sometimes hard to find in stores). But as for this one, it feels exactly the same to me as their Moisture Renewal conditioner, Frizzy to Smooth conditioner, Smooth conditioner, etc. Which isn\'t surprising, considering the ingredient lists look almost identical.Different products work for different people, so I\'m not suggesting that this is a lousy conditioner-- only that it\'s not the right one for me.

The wireless SmartGuide is another useful; but, fun feature.  This is a must have, for good overall oral health."

The timer is fun to use and my teeth have never felt so clean.  I love that it\'s incredibly fast and lets me know when I\'m brushing too hard.  It\'s expensive, but it was worth spending all my Goodie Drawers from work on. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I have never gushed about a toothbrush before, but this one is amazing."

It shaves really smooth and I have yet to nick or cut myself with it. My only complaint is that the razor can be a little messy with the moisture bar as it has a tendency to get gooey and slimy while using it. I\'m always sure to rinse it off good and give it a really good shake before I put it away to make sure it\'s mostly dried off. I don\'t store the razor in the shower where the water will hit it constantly or it would eat away the moisture bar in no time. I shave my legs every other day and this razor seems to do a really good job at shaving close and keeping my legs looking good for the time between shaving. Overall, I\'m happy with this razor and might even buy some refills on my own when I\'m done using up what came with the razor.    "

Each new iteration of this series promises an even closer shave than the previous one.  I now own two MACH3 Turbo razors (given as gifts), but am less than satisfied with the product.When the blades are new, the shave is great, but they don\'t last that long.  Don\'t even think about buying blades and storing them -- at least they don\'t work that well in the tropics.  I\'ve found the conditioning strips began melting on my unused blades and sometimes even causing rust on the blade.  My experience with this razor is bittersweet, it is probably the best razor on the market but cost of blades will do you in quickly.I can\'t wait for the next iteration of this series, although by then I might move on to an electric shaver.  Basically don\'t believe the advertising -- a shave that close will probably only happen once with a fresh blade, and if you have thick hair it may also give you a little nick to get it.    "

I first purchased the Blonde Expresssions shampoo that did an excellent job at \'Brighening\' my hair that seemed to dull (I didn\'t even have to re-dye it which I was planning to). It made my hair a  little staticy so I decided to give the conditioner a try and what a major difference!! My hair is already silky, and shiney even more so!! It must be the Kape seed oil in the conditioner, although this does not have the crystals that brighten your hair, the two used in conjunction with each other produce a great result!! "

It does NOT navigate curvy legs very well. I had more than one significant cut the first time I used it.  I felt like the head pivoted a little TOO much which made it hard to keep the blades in contact with my skin.  The gels strips do not lather, but do have a very strong, but not unpleasant fragrance.  However, if you are sensitive to perfume, this is not your razor.Because the head is so bulky, the shave actually took longer than with a straight razor. The bulbous looking things on either side of the blade created drag on curved areas, such as underarms and ankles and didn\'t glide over those areas successfully.  I had to go over them several times to remove all unwanted hair.I would say this is BETTER than the Soliel razor that I bought for less money (smoother shave) but not as good as the Venus Embrace which gave me a smoother shave with a little less effort and no heavy perfume.My overall complaint with ALL of the Gillette Venus line is that the razors are very bulky. They do provide a good shave, but you have to cover the same areas more than once because the shave head is so large.  For my sensitive skin, that means more razor irritation.  I would recommend this one over several other out there, but if you want the best shave for the same price, go with the Embrace.    "

(I thought I was ordering the pump kind...and figured I would give it a try instead of paying to have it shipped back.)  I really like the Pantene flexible hold pump hairspray, but was not pleased with the aerosol.  It left a lot of residue in my hair.  I am not used to aerosol, so maybe I used too much, but I tried using less and it didn\'t seem to do the job.  My hair looked fine, but the residue that was left made it hard to comb through, I had to pull it off with my fingers and my hair broke off.  I wash my hair daily, so hygiene wasn\'t the problem.  If you plan on using it, I suggest using a clarifying shampoo fairly often to help with the residue.  Another thing I didn\'t like was trying to spray my hair, because of the air, it would move my hair, so so I had to hold it in place to spray...don\'t have to do that with the pump kind!  If you like aerosol and you know how to use it...then you will probably have no problems with this hairspray! "

My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack, even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping.  He is not happy with this product.  He\'s been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products, namely, Gillette Fusion, which he prefers.  Also, insofar as use on his sensitive skin, the gel is only so-so.  The fragrance is okay with him.  However, what he particularly doesn\'t like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide.  Now we have about four cans left, which he will grudgingly use, unless I can find him a deal on Fusion.  He\'s encouraging me to find one...soon.    "

This \'new\' formula leaves my hair dull and super staticky and extremely flyaway...what a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. No volume, no shine, no manageability.

Believe me...been there, done that.How incredibly stupid and short-sighted of Pantene to discontinue this line, and all the others. From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers\' preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...well. Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers. \'Flat\' indeed!!I will now have to stock up on my regular Volume favorites at premium prices from elsewhere and try and find something else that works when that runs out.
