Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price. So I asked myself, \'How bad can they be\'?The brush heads I received looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense). When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example. On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth). These brush heads have very poor motion constraint. The circular brush can easily \'slide\' around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).Not only that, but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing. As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \'knock-off\', more interested in looking like the original than acting like it.My advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads. Your mouth and your dentist will thank you."

I have used this product before and have purchased it from Amazon previously.  The color strips on these are orange, when previously they were blue.  Even the first shave from these cartridges is uncomfortable.  Subsequent shaves are much worse.  Do not waste your money.  If you like the Gillette brand, spend a little more and buy them from your local store.  These are obviously reject products and Amazon should not be selling them.    "

In the shower or bath, I\'d rather be washing my hair or something which feels more nuturing and relaxing. Therefore, this new razor has an appeal for me because it actually  1) feels good as I hold it (I make jewelry, and I like the feel of a well made tool in my hand--this razor, Venus Embrace, is almost ergonomically designed) and 2) feels good as it glides on my legs.The pod holder won\'t work out here, as we have children. Anyone who leaves an exposed razor in the shower, held by a pod wih suction cups, who has kids, is, of course, insane. I suppose I see the appeal of the pod for childless people, who want a razor which has a station where it can be \'docked\' to air-dry conveniently, and there IS a good spot for the extra cartidges to be stored inside.The pod looks like a small space ship or a mini house designed by a famous architect, or possibly it just resembles an egg. I enjoyed looking at it for a while before I locked it and the razor in the closet after using them.I definitely recommend this razor and I will continue to use it. I will continue to buy refills for it as well. It is simple to use, pleasant to hold, as I said, and easy to deal with. Off to shampoo, now!    "

It\'s not that I didn\'t brush after every meal when I was doing it manually; it\'s that these toothbrushes do a significantly better job. Furthermore, although their use has never actually whitened my teeth, it slows down the degree of stain accumulation from tea, coffee, etc., so that I do not have to bleach my teeth as often.Having said all that: This model does not work any better than my trusty Oral-B S-200. It also has the same drawback, that the rechargeable batteries do not last forever and when they give out, you must buy a whole new unit. When in use, the toothbrush sounds louder than the S-200 and different, resembling a dentist\'s drill.  For anyone thinking of using older heads they have around, my S-200 heads do not fit on this model--the shaft is different. The brushes themselves are round instead of the traditional oval--I can\'t see any advantage to that but perhaps a dentist can.Is this toothbrush worth using?  Absolutely. Is it the best value in an electric toothbrush?  Perhaps not."

In the past I have only used the traditional small, round brush head. I saw these on Amazon and decided to pick them up. They clean very well, seemingly better than the smaller brush heads. They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft. Also, the \'floss action\' plastic tips around the perimeter don\'t really seem to be flossing more than they are just contributing to the roughness of the overall brushing experience. Overall, I give them 3.5/5UPDATE: After using these for a month now, I have to say that the bristles do become softer over time yet giving you a good cleaning. I give them 4 stars."

Prior reviewers have already commented on the power converter that sticks 3 inches out from the electrical wall plug - duh. Also the enigma of how to open the battery compartment of the \'Smart Guide Display unit\'. (TWO covers to be removed with gorilla fingers, sliding each in opposite directions.)Fortunately the rechargeable (Ni-MH) battery in the handle can be replaced (compared to the older Braun models that became useless once the battery died), but how to change the battery is a deeper mystery. (Amidst the very poorly written instructions, the section for replacing the rechargeable battery provides only a small diagram that is utterly unintelligible.) I went to the [...] website and clicked on \'email us\', but what a bad joke that was - I just ended in an endless search option in their FAQ section. Next I\'ll call them at [...].Oh, then you have to remember twice a year to not use the battery charger, so that the battery discharges completely in order to \'maintain the maximum capacity of the rechargeable body\'. (Since a full charge is claimed to last at least 10 days, I suppose one then turns on the toothbrush and leaves it running on the bathroom counter... hoping the internal moving parts don\'t wear out in the process.)CRITICAL: In these days of airline security concerns, if you bring the toothbrush with you (as my dentist recommends), DON\'T FORGET to deactivate the radio transmitter that is built into the toothbrush handle (to communicate with the \'Smart Guide display unit\').In summary: This is a fabulous toothbrush (10x better than my previous Braun model) but a disaster on the \'user friendliness\' scale.

It\'s amazing how few razors meet this criteria. The new unpowered Gillette Fusion razor does this better than the older Gillette model it replaced.For me, my beard tends to outgrow razors. I can live with one for a few years and then, suddenly, I find it no longer gives me a close shave. That\'s when I know it\'s time to change.What\'s different with Fusion is I need hardly any effort to remove facial hair and don\'t need much pressure from the hand or wrist. Just get the thing on my face and move it and it does the job even on my chin, under my nose, off my jawbone and in those other spots where lines are hardly flat or straight. The razor has another cutting edge on the back you can use for straight cuts to sideburns or elsewhere,  if you choose.I cut myself a few times the first time I used Fusion and was concerned the five cutting edges may be too much for me. But I quickly adjusted by releasing the pressure in my shaving hand and now take a close shave sans cuts for granted every morning of my life.Ergo, this razor meets my only criteria expertly. I\'d recommend this product to anyone that wants what I want, a close shave without cuts.    "
4685,1512,1548,20090913,B001CX4JSS,4,"September 13, 2009",AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"At last, an alternative to Sonicare","Sonicare and Oral-B are the two largest manufacturers of high-end powered toothbrushes. They initially entered the market using very different technologies: ultrasonic vibration for Sonicare, rotary brushes for Oral-B.Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces. They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task. The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges. At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B\'s rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.Sonicare\'s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system. The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled. These brushes are sold under the FlexCare moniker.After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare. I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare\'s. I don\'t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied. This may actually be a good thing since you\'re supposed to only apply it gently.Oral-B includes a feature similar to what Sonicare calls the \'quad-pacer,\' essentially a timer that signals you when it\'s time to switch quadrants (every 30 seconds)Battery life is about a week.Included in the package: brush, charging stand, bonus interstitial brush... but no travel case.PROS----- a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets- very low price for this technology- easy to clean- small charging stand- small brush, great for little hands- quad pacer- setting for sensitive gumsCONS----- may be too small for some hands- charger is 110V only (you need a transformer, not just an adapter, to use it overseas)- no travel caseCONCLUSION----------Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes. At less than half the price of the cheapest FlexCare, the Pulsonic is worthy of your consideration. Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don\'t move the brush back and forth, don\'t push hard: just hold it in place and let it do its job. You will get the best results if you rinse with Listerine and floss before brushing."

Today it costs $60 on amazon while the Oral-B Pulsonic costs $47.  If you are in the market for a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I\'d say either of these would be a good investment.  Both have two settings, except it seems the Oral-B has the \'faster\' setting start first whereas the WaterPik starts a slower speed first.  The Oral-B is slimmer, lighter, easier to hold onto.  Both brushes come with base units but the unit for the Oral-B is smaller and lighter than that of the WaterPik, but it also is easier to push around by accident.  The WaterPik comes with 2 brush heads, the Oral-B, just one.  When recharging the WaterPik blinks and when it stops, you know it has been charged fully, the Oral-B does not.I have not experienced the trouble of the brush head falling off the Oral-B brush, and overall I would say that the Oral-B seems more \'powerful\' in its vibrations.  I can\'t say that\'s a bad thing, but after using the WaterPik for so long, it\'s something one has to get used to.  Overall I\'d say either electric brush is a good investment.  While you get a little more with the WaterPik, it is also a heavier brush and more expensive.  In the end, all they really do is vibrate and you have to move them around.  If I had a choice, I\'d probably choose the Oral-B (which I switched to as soon as I received it), only because it\'s slimmer and lighter and I find it easier to use."

That will soften the hair and open the pores.I also recommend Kiehl\'s brand \'Blue Eagle\' or \'White Eagle\' shaving cream. It\'s about $20 a jar but it\'s by far the best shaving cream I\'ve used. It\'s so thick you can even reshave each area many times without getting razor burn or irritation.Using cold water on the area after shaving will close the pores more quickly and help avoid razor bumps and dirty pores, etc...

I can\'t get that with any other electric or non-electric toothbrush. The better a product is, the harder I evaluate it and the more nit-picky I become, so here go the suggested improvements: First, the recommended cleaning time is 2 minutes which I believe is way too short. I double that by brushing the lower and upper jaw, each using the times for my entire mouth. Last, the controls are too easy to accidentally hit. This causes the toothbrush to go into another cleaning mode when you didn\'t want it to. I don\'t know how you can fix this except to be careful when holding the toothbrush and not accidentally hit one of the two buttons on the handle.

I was at Target a few weeks ago looking for pads when I noticed that Always Infinity was on sale. Ever since they debuted I had basically avoided them like the plague because they\'re more expensive than Always Ultrathins with wings and I had a sneaking suspicion that the product was more hype than substance. But another customer saw me mulling the purchase over and insisted that I buy it. \'Oh, it holds a lot!\' she gushed (no pun intended). \'Trust me!\'Okay, so I did. I bought a box of \'heavy flow\' Infinity plus another box of Ultrathins for \'back up.\' And thank God I did! These pads have got to be the weirdest and most ineffectual maxis I have ever tried. When I first opened one up, I was horrified. First of all, the \'pad\' isn\'t at all like the cotton pad you would expect from a feminine napkin. The material is some kind of \'compressed material\', very similar in feel, flatness and texture to one of those oldskool white spongy Doctor Scholl\'s inserts. It even had the same type of holes in it (at the front of the pad). Making matters worse, there were some goofy markings in the back of the pad, making it look more like some futuristic landing strip at a spaceport than a maxi pad.And the entire thing was tiny. It was so small I had to double check to make sure which size pad I had gotten. But nope, this was indeed the heavy flow pad I was trying out.At any rate, I tried it out and holy frijoles, the adhesive was so weak, the wings couldn\'t attach properly. So I kept pressing them again and they flopped back out like they went, \'OH, NO SHE DIDN\'T! SHE DID NOT TRY STICKING US TO HER UNDERWEAR!\' By this point, my patience was wearing thin, but I had a box of these and was determined to try them out. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Within an hour I could see that flow was leaking/ rolling past the perimeters of the pad. I decided not to chance the pads as my period went into its heavy flow stage and went with my regular Ultrathin Overnights. Then when my flow went light again, I tried the Infinity again for one night. Woke up the next morning and saw that after pooling in the middle, the very little flow I\'d had hopped, skipped, and rolled past the futuristic spaceport landing strip markings in the back of the pad and then found its \'happy place\' in the back of my underwear. Nice.Needless to say, I wasn\'t happy with these  and will still keep using Ultrathins. There\'s one plus side-- if I experience shoe pain in the future and there are no Dr. Scholl\'s inserts to be had, I can use these instead."

What I found is that the Vitality has a lot more power -- judged by the vibrations in my head -- plus it\'s even lighter weight, has replaceable heads, and a timer.Lighter weight is good, as are the replaceable heads because that means the whole family can use one base, and you can replace the toothbrush-head after flu or colds.More power should mean that it cleans better.  What I found is that my mouth felt \'cleaner\'... BUT, after I let my teeth \'go\' and get rather \'grotty\' for test reasons, the Vitality didn\'t seem to clean any better in those hard to reach between teeth spots, than it\'s cheaper cousin.  To be honest, I\'m not sure what to make of this observation.  I tried the cheaper cousin after that, plus a standard toothbrush, and nothing worked except floss -- thank heaven -- so perhaps my expectations are too high and no brush would accomplish this task.THE SKINNY:::We will be switching to this Oral B toothbrush and the reason is that I think it\'s more cost effective for us than cheaper Oral B battery operated models that we are currently using.  Though more expensive initially, you can purchase replacement heads so the whole family can use one base.I like the timer.  I thought only the kids would benefit, but to my surprise I wasn\'t brushing long enough either.It doesn\'t remove plague like claimed, but it definitely has more power than our comparison Oral B\'s, and made my mouth feel cleaner.I liked that the brushes were NOT rock hard.  Rock-hard is not good for the gums.Pam T~mom and blogger"

They are comparable to other wipes, but as others have noted on reviews, they are quite narrow.  This allows one to get one good front to back swipe if holding the wipe lengthwise over the hand. May need two depending on amount of cleaning desired. I bought these mainly to have a portable wipe for work, when forced to use public restrooms (never know if there will be TP once you get in the stall!), or any other time away from home. 4 stars only because I do not particularly care for the added fragrance, and would prefer an adult \'baby wipe\' that is more gentle for sensitive areas.

The brush would consistently grow mold over time regardless of how careful I was.  While the Sonicare still has more bells and whistles overall (this could be due to model difference), I\'m willing to sacrifice those little things for what I think is probably one of the two criteria that actually matter: 1) how well the brush cleans and 2) how clean the brush stays.

I WILL LOOK NO FURTHER.","(This is Lisa\'s son speaking.)Shaving has been a frustrating and embarrassing experience for me for years.  There has always been some kind of trade-off between closeness, irritation, tendency to produce ingrown hairs, price, and speed of use.  I never understood how my friends and family members were able to achieve a close and fast shave on a regular basis, while I would shave twice as slowly and get a shave half as good as theirs. I\'ve tried manual razors, electric foil razors, and electric rotary razors.  I had settled on manual razors (only shaving with the grain) because it produced the least irritation and didn\'t leave patches of uncut hairs like all the electric ones I\'ve tried.  Unfortunately, due to my pattern of beard growth, manual razors tended to leave me with ingrown hairs all along my jawline, despite my best efforts to prevent them.  I had figured that I had to settle for dealing with them until now.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best of the manual and electric shaving worlds.  It provides a much closer, faster, consistent, and comfortable shave with no ingrown hairs whatsoever.  Superior in all ways.  You have no idea how relieved I am to have found this razor.    "

But few complains about this specific model 5000.1) The handle on 5000 is much bigger than on other similar toothbrushes. It is less comfortable to hold in hand.2) The extra device coming with model 5000 is useless. It is supposedly an \'advanced\' timer which makes beeping noise when you need to switch sides of teeth to brush and when to stop brusing. I think, timers embedded in the toothbrush handle itself (what they do for less expensive models) do better job - there is absolutely no benefits to have timer separately (in addition it\'s screen is hard to see).3)The electric plug on this toothbrush is much longer than on other models. The base, though, is much smaller. Apparently they moved electronics from the base (where toothbrush stands) to the plug. It does not look good when plug is plugged in recepticle and it makes dificulties always to avoid pushing the plug.4) Another big complain - never received rebate. it was $50 rebate for this toothbrush when I bought it in August.

I\'d been using Schick Slim Twins disposable razors to shave my legs for twenty years and considered them perfectly adequate.  I thought it was an advertising gimmick.Then I tried the Venus, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Honest-to-goodness, it\'s like shaving your legs with a piece of satin, and it gets every hair, too.  The lubrication strips are better than others I\'ve tried--you really don\'t need shaving cream or soap, and they last quite a while.The Venus has the added advantage of a holder that suction-cups to the shower wall, so you don\'t lose the razor.  So far it has stayed put.  Inside the holder is a spare blade, so if you decide it\'s time to change blades, you don\'t have to venture dripping from the shower to find a refill.Yeah, the blades are expensive.  But I HATE shaving my legs, and anything that can make it quicker, easier and more comfortable is worth my money.  The Venus is a bit more ecological than disposable razors, too.  I enthusiastically recommend this product.    "

Glide Deep Clean is wonderfully smooth and comfortable, making flossing downright pleasant on both your gums and your fingers. The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you\'ve cleaned.But... It\'s the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest\'s claims of being \'shred resistant\' fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven\'t yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can\'t even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn\'t inspire confidence. At the price premium Crest is demanding, I\'d expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece."

I got a smooth shave without nicks and I found the semi-solid handle to be ingenious.The five blades, on the other hand, seem a bit like overkill.  I shaved one leg with the five bladed Venus Embrace and another leg with my three bladed plain old Venus and I honestly did not notice a difference.  Both were smooth at the start without nicks, and both grew back at about the same rate.  I\'m of the opinion that the quality of your shave depends more on the quality of the blade than simply the number of blades.If you\'re looking to get this razor just for it\'s five blades, I can\'t say it\'s worth the cost.  As a razor, it\'s great, but it\'s not better than a three-blade as far as I\'m concerned.However, the semi-solid handle may be worth it.  It\'s comfortable to hold and use and moves with you to some extent.  It gets in the tight places better than other razors and helps to keep you from pressing too hard against your skin as you go.As for me, I\'m keeping my Venus Embrace handle and buying whatever cartridges are least expensive when I go shopping.  With four kids, I find the Venus Breeze cartridges to suit my short shower needs best.  Those and the Embrace handle are a great fit for me.    "

Featuring five blades and a stunning new razor design, the Fusion is a truly attractive razor. But is it \'the best a man can get\'? Not for this man.Aesthetics: 4 stars. The Fusion design is truly excellent and far superior to other razors. The handle has been greatly extended compared to the Mach 3 handle, and a noticeable amount of weight and girth has been added as well. This is a razor that will feel comfortable in almost any man\'s hand. The blade cartridge itself keeps this razor from getting 5 stars in my opinion. Fusion cartridges are about the same size as cartridges for the average razor for women. This will require many men to slightly alter the way they shave their faces; however, the one-blade trimmer (on top of the razor) helps a good bit.The shave: a disappointing 3 stars. The Fusion gave me an incredibly close shave. I mean incredibly close. My face hasn\'t been that smooth since I was a child. I thought the trimmer worked well for its purpose. But -- and this is a big \'but\' -- the shave was honestly too close for comfort. After every shave with the Fusion, my face felt extremely sensitive for the rest of the day. I cannot help but believe that the 5-blade design caused the discomfort that I felt after using the Fusion. Perhaps other men will not have this issue. For those with sensitive skin (like me), your best bet might be to avoid the Fusion.Blade durability: 4 stars. This was where the Fusion blades really shined. With most razors, I typically have to change blades once a week. With the Fusion, I used the same blade for 2 weeks with no trouble at all. The blade still felt fresh after a week, and drag was minimal into the second week.Overall: The razor was decent. Certainly an impressive shave, but perhaps too close for some due to the unneccesary number of blades. The biggest problem with the Fusion is that the blades are insanely expensive. In my opinion, the cost of Fusion blades diminishes everything else that might be good about it.UPDATE: Decided to give the Fusion another shot by buying an entirely new system with a new blade. Still an incredibly disappointing razor with lots of irritation. It\'s just one or two blades too many. I cannot say the shave is any closer than a Schick Quattro or even a Gillette Sensor Excel on a good day. Would be nice to see Gillette take this razor design, with the longer handle and closer blade spacing, and port it over to a 3-blade.    "

The ShowerPod also holds extra razor cartridges which I found to be another great feature.I have to say it really does give you a close shave.

While I was impressed with the Mach 3, and more so with the Mach 3 Turbo, when I switched to the Quattro, I knew that was the razor for me. Close shave, smooth glide, rarely any cuts at all even on my difficult-to-shave face. Recently when I went to the store, they were out of the 4-pack of Quattro blades, and so instead of buying an 8-pack, I decided to try this brand new razor from Gillette. I\'d never had a 5-blade razor before (let alone a battery-powered vibrating one) and so I decided to go all out, even though I was very disappointed to find that the cartridges cost $3.50 EACH.It comes in a nice easy-to-open clamshell package with a cheesy-looking but convenient holder that can either lay flat or stand vertically, which is what I prefer. It comes with a battery, which was very easy to install, and is touted as being shower-proof. I wouldn\'t know, because I don\'t shave in the shower.The vibration was not at all what I was expecting. I don\'t really know what I was expecting since this was my first powered razor, but when they say \'gentle micro-pulses\' I think of a soft intermittent buzz. Not so. This razor is strong, and it vibrates like a cell phone, constantly, insistently and very noticably. I was surprised by how strong the vibration was for a small appliance.I used my standard Gillette foam shave cream, and set to work trimming my face. The first thing I noticed is that I couldn\'t really feel the razor on my face as it vibrated and shaved my whiskers. The second thing I noticed is that I also couldn\'t feel when my face was clean-shaven while the razor was vibrating. I rely on the way the razor feels and sounds on my skin to know when I\'m done shaving a spot, and the vibration drowned out any noise or sensation or any other feedback I might have gotten from the razor. However, it didn\'t make that much of a difference, because I had to go over the same spots four or five times in order to make them clean-shaven. I\'m not sure what the 5th blade is doing, but I don\'t have to shave the same spots that many times with even an old blade on my Quattro. However, when I was done, the final result was a pretty good shave, with a few nicks here and there--the Fusion doesn\'t work well with bumps on the face when vibrating.I also used the single trimmer blade on my sideburns. It seems to work as advertised, and it is easy to use for accurate trimming of the sideburns. The problem, however, is that the single-blade end is no good for shaving a larger area such as your entire moustache, but the five-blade side is way too large for such a task. I found it very awkward to shave my moustache area with either end.Bottom line: I will be returning the Fusion and exchanging it for a set of replacement cartridges for my Quattro. It still outperforms the Fusion in spite of having one less blade in the area of comfort and shaving sensation, and the cartridges are $1.50 cheaper each. I may go back to the Fusion sometime, but if I did, it would be the manual version, never the vibrating version. This was my first and last experience with a battery-powered razor.    "

6463,227,231,20100613,B003JA3KDW,3,"June 13, 2010",A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,"OK conditioner, weird curling results","My hair has a natural wave that is easily coaxed into curls with a little gel or mousse and allowing to air dry.  The Pantene curly hair series conditioner doesn\'t condition my dry ends as much as other conditioners do, but at the same time it didn\'t make it worse as some products have, so I can\'t really complain.The conditioner is quite clingy in the shower, meaning it\'s really hard to massage into the entire length of my hair.  It wants to say where it was first applied, which is quite odd.  It rinses clean and smells nice.  I don\'t use more of it than I do any of Pantene\'s conditioners.When I use the conditioner and just let my hair air dry without product, my hair becomes what I suppose could be called \'curlier.\'  In fact, it\'s as though my hair gets separated out into a series of almost ringlet-like strands.  However, it\'s frizzy, and when I comb through my hair it loses those ringlet things and just becomes a fuzzy bunch of waves.  It is easily tamed by some (other brand) of mild leave-in conditioner and/or spray curl enhancer.  In comparison, I have some Pantene conditioner for dyed hair from their previous series and, while it doesn\'t leave my hair in those ringlet-curls, it also doesn\'t leave my hair frizzy either.When I use the curly hair series conditioner with product in my hair and let it air dry, the hair avoids the ringlet look and turns into what\'s more of an 80s perm, but not frizzy at all.  Combing it out produces a pretty nice series of controlled waves, but there is a tendency to frizz during the day.  Again comparing it with the Pantene conditioner for color-treated hair, it works about the same but provides more controlled waves than the color-treated version does.In all, I personally wouldn\'t buy the curl series conditioner.  Actually, I\'m not sure if I\'d buy any of their product as their current line exists.  See, I\'ve used many Pantene products over the years, and years ago I used Pantene curl products and liked them.  The conditioner was much better than this version; however, Pantene reformulates and repackages their products every few years, which not only means you lose the type of Pantene you liked to use, but also that it\'s hard to stick with Pantene as an overall brand.  I did (and do) continue to use Pantene, always buying whatever series had stronger conditioning than their ever-present Classic Care line.However, with this new series there is no high-conditioning product.  Right now they have Classic Care as they always do, plus curly, color treated, fine hair, medium-thick hair... well, my hair is 3 out of those 4, which do I choose?  I suspect everyone\'s hair falls into more than one of Pantene\'s categories.  It\'s possible there isn\'t a product in their current line-up for me to use, which means I\'ll have to wait 2-3 years until they reformulate yet again. "

When working, even though I made enough money then to buy the EXPENSIVE replacement cartridges, it always left me complaining about the price of such a wonderful shaving experience. Now that I am retired, I had switched to the old fashioned safety razor and began buying assortment packs of different manufactures blades till I found what works best for ME. Turned out, the very cheapest of the dozen brands, works best for me so I have been much happier shaving the old fashioned CHEAP way.  Enter this new version of my old friend....I had to try it since the one biggest downside for me with a so called safety razor is cutting myself. Since a recent heart attack and the blood thinner medication I now have to take, cuts are becoming a real problem. And this razor is SO much safer as well as more comfortable, I had to try it when offered on the Vine Program. Feels the same, looks a little better (to me anyway) than my old unit. Now, this \'soothing micro-pulses for incredible comfort\'? OK, if you say so....Myself, it is simply a major distraction! I can\'t feel what is going on since the vibration is just a MAJOR distraction to the shaving for me. I simply have stopped using this \'feature\'. Every beard is different, every shaver has their own preference. What one loves, another hates etc. Needs are different, results are different. I kind of found all the razor & blade reviews to be sort of useless for me since there are simply too many variables involved in this activity?  But there is one place this series of razor really excels. COMFORT! Vibrate or not, I would really have to want to cut myself, and want to badly to do so. It is buttery smooth for my face. That simply OUTRAGOUS price for new blade refills is somewhat offset by the fact this 5 blade model lasts a bit longer than my single blade safety razor blades. But it still costs so much more, that this return to this razor will end for me, once these blades are done. It is safe, comfortable, and such a close shave, I hate to leave. But retirement pay is just 1/5th of my old working paycheck and this is right at the top of the list for things to cut (bad pun...). Another thing I love about this razor is when I get up in the morning to shave, I have probably only 1/3-1/4th the beard to shave as compared to the next morning if I had used my trusty safety razor.  Bottom line? IF you can afford it and don\'t mind allocating this much money for new blade cartridges, enjoy! It is an amazing tool. I just won\'t spend the money anymore. And another thing, maybe it\'s just me? I see, nor feel, ANY difference in the closeness of the shave either using the vibration feature or NOT using it. When I use it, I really have trouble knowing how well it is cutting. I mean, I have NO sense of if it is cutting or not? Off, it is simply a wonderful razor, but one last time...IF you are willing to pay the high price. Wish I made more money!_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5/28/2010 Update:  OK, I have found another problem with this razor that applies to \'me\' but probably not to the general shaving public? I have several deep scars/crevice wounds to my face from my motorcycle & jet ski racing days (crashes...) This razor simply can NOT get into those areas where a single blade safety razor has NO problem. So if you don\'t have a perfectly smooth (scar free )face, it may not work well for you? I also did some math on replacement blades. Figure around $3.50-$4.00 per refill on this razor. On my safety razor, my blades cost me just 15 CENTS! That 15 CENTS, shaves me perfectly for 7 days. After that, the shave degrades till at 10 days, I no longer have comfort using it. So maybe this can be a guide to the insane cost of using this razor. Bug again, it is such a subjective thing. To someone who has a decent job, they may consider this cost trivial? Or, not even have realized just how out of line it is with alternatives out there. For me, back to the future with a good old safety razor works best. Now I remember why....Take a look at: SHARP STAINLESS Double Edge Polymer Coated Safety Razor Blades for instance. Then look at all the choices for blades in the good old fashioned safety razor. I would give this:- 4 stars for closeness on a smooth face-- 3 stars on a face with scars-- 1 star for cost-  Over all, I let my 4 stars stand since (again),shaving is a very personal & yet subjective thing. One razor doesn\'t fit all.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5/31/2010 Update:Well this will get me some hate mail but I have to downgrade my review from 4 stars to just 3 stars. Reason? I used to get up to 3 weeks of close shaves on the OLD style (see my pictures). This new one with new & \'improved\' thinner blades? Just 7 days and it is cutting me like crazy. But remember, I have to take blood thinner since a recent heart attack. More to the point, I have to ask myself, was this redesign just a way to make sure that the great (but expensive) shave of the old model, would be even better (but ONLY for the manufacturer?) if they discovered a way to get the old design blades not to last so darn long? If so, they REALLY succeeded! This blade is just used up for me after just 7 days. Now my old fashioned safety razor only costs about 15 CENTS. This one? How about $4.25 each???? Sorry, but that is just INSANE!    "

Upon receiving the product, it did not look anything like the original brush heads that I received with the toothbrush I bought months ago from Amazon. The primary differences were: the bristles were the wrong color(the center green was a darker translucent color instead of the opaque light green), the bristles were splayed out instead of in tight clusters, and the gray logo was much lighter. I chalked this up to maybe changes in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the first brush head I tried did not work at all. I chalked that up to manufacturing defect. The second one worked, but didn\'t quite feel right. I decided to just go with it however, and after a month the brush head became very loose. I saw the other reviews and photos and realized that I had received fake product directly from Amazon.Here is the worst part. I decided to purchase replacement heads from Walgreens retail store. I got home and realized that they were also fake product. So, then I went to Target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine. I was floored to find fake product in a retail chain store as well as at Amazon.So, TLDR buyer beware of fake product when ordering online or shopping at retail. Look at the brush heads carefully before you make your purchase. It seems like there is a major counterfeiting problem right now and it hopefully gets resolved soon."

Some people have said they get like 100-200 shaves per blade.  I guess the key is that these blades don\'t lose their efficacy after a few shaves because they go dull, but because they accumulate gunk.  The blade saver products allow you to remove the gunk.I\'m sure Gillette and the other blade makers are hoping the whole world doesn\'t catch onto this.    "

The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  It\'s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  And children may find it more fun to use.How many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  Typical for Oral B\'s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn\'t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  Separate on and off buttons, are located on the handle.The Pulsar is being packaged and sold in various quantities.  At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B\'s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work."

After about 2 weeks, the battery display started to develop moisture within the display. At around one month, the display could no longer be seen since condensation had turned into large water globules that obstructed the display.With 4 uses per day by two adults, after 3.5 months, the toothbrush failed to turn on but would activate after a few minutes or sometime in the day by itself. It is apparent that the board has gone bad and the toothbrush is no longer useable reliably.Pros:This toothbrush has a holding stand that can hold up to four individual heads for multiple users, or different toothbrush heads. (Be sure to dry your toothbrush head before placing in case, or you will have a gradual soap scum build up)Multiple Settings for persons with sensitive teeth.Timer that displays vibrations by 30 second intervals for dentistry recommended minimum of 30 seconds per quadrant.Timer also displays time. (Would like to have had the timer lit since the angle is almost at 90 degrees and should be angled slightly higher by about 15 degrees more for adult use.)Cons:The price is high for what seems to be only a timer radio frequency linked display and a few lower setting for strength of brushDid not last long for something that is exposed to soap in mouth and running water when rinsedPower connection is very l;arge and takes up a lot of spaceaway from the electrical socket. (MOst people are limited to counter space in the bathroom)In conclusion, I liked the design and feel of the toothbrush but was very dissapointed that it broke on me after only a few months. A little red light displays on the timer to show if you are being to rough on your tooth enamel when brushing, which I liked but also wanted the motor to be as powerful as previous models. Maybe this was bad for my teeth, but I could feel the difference on the gum lining of each tooth when touching sliding my tongue for cleanliness.since some people have a hard time returning things, maybe this one should be bought in a store with a guaranty instead of online. I will try to contact Oral B and Amazon about a replacement, and will update this review upon their response with difficulty or ease."

They are also one of the most expensive brands on the market, and frankly I think it\'s ridiculous for something that women have to continually buy for health reasons. It is obvious that the company makes more money off of these tampons because they are trying to get everyone to convert to them, rather than using their more affordable and environmentally friendly cardboard ones.I might buy these if a young girl who is new to using tampons (I remember what it was like using one for the first time, using a plastic applicator is helpful in that case).

There is room inside the pod to store extra razor cartridges and the cartridges are individually sealed to stay clean and dry when stored in the shower. The razor itself has five blades and a soft grip handle that makes the razor pleasant to hold and use.I had some misgivings about trying the Venus Embrace razor because any time I\'ve used disposable razors in the past, I ended up with painful nicks and cuts all over the place. I was pleasantly surprised once I used the razor. The shave was so smooth that I actually thought it wasn\'t working until I checked the razor and my leg. The five blades do a great job of shaving. It did take a few attempts for the shower pod to stick on the shower wall, but once it did stick the razor fit neatly into the pod and it proved to be very handy. The blades face against the shower wall, so there\'s no fear of accidentally brushing against it and cutting yourself. The fact that there\'s room inside the pod for extra cartridges is terrific, in case you need to change the cartridges mid-shave. It is very easy to change the cartridges, which is a plus. However, the extra cartridges are not cheap, which is a minus.The Venus Embrace razor is one of the best razors that I\'ve ever used.    "

While there are a few safe ingredients, I was concerned about a few of the chemicals listed.  I wish manufacturers would also stop adding fragrance.  If deodorant has it, and hair spray has it, and you use perfume, how many fragrances do you need at one time?  But until more women feel this way, companies are likely compelled to add yet one more chemical to the mix.  To be REALLY fair, I would probably go to a store and read the ingredients on a lot more shampoo bottles.  Pro-V may not be any worse than other shampoos.While I am not chemically sensitive, others are.  But these people are probably buying products at the health food store instead of the drug store.

It\'s not as effective as previous Venus style blades. The good part is it\'s nearly impossible to cut yourself with this head. It is so wide, and the blades so recessed, that they don\'t really scrape the skin the way you expect. For those used to using the larger Venus blades, this will take only a little adjustment, because it\'s a little wider than the earlier models. For those used to normal shaving heads, this will seem odd and will take quite a bit of adjustment. I don\'t know about using it on more delicate spots - I don\'t think I\'d try.The blades are spaced so that they are surprisingly easy to rinse and they don\'t clog. The handle is probably the best Venus has produced so far. The shower pod is ok - the suction cups actually stick to the wall as they should and it holds a couple of spare blades.If you have trouble with nicks, or if you have boney areas around your knees or ankles, I think you\'ll like this set-up. For my part, it\'s ok, but I\'ll be sticking with the previous Venus blades, which are the best available, and give a closer shave. I might nick myself once in a while when I wouldn\'t with this one, but it\'s worth it to me to get the closer shave. Someone with more sensitive skin might prefer this model, and the moisturizing strips are just right - not too \'gloppy\' but still improving the \'glide\' factor.    "

One pull of the razor across my face makes the skin unbelievably smooth.  I won\'t be switching to anything else after buying this product.TIPS:Don\'t throw the cartridges out after the aloe \'indicator\' strip fades - that thing is useless junk added on to make you replace the blades more often than is necessary.  Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies.  The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing.  They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry.  I can get more than a month of shaves out of a single cartridge before the blades dull and start to nick or pull at the skin.  Buying a 12-pack of blades lasts me longer than a year . . .    "

We still have a bunch of blades for it though, so do I buy another one so she can finish using the blades, or do we buy a different razor that won\'t just break after a few weeks.  So I do not recommend this purchase unless you feel like being trapped in a similar situation where you have blades but no handle for them to go on.  Extremely poor design.

I won\'t even start on the price Gillette charges for this razor and its cartridges...I have tossed this razor and now use a \'old school\' safety razor, the razor that made Gillette a household name.  I get a much closer and more comfortable shave.  Gillette, now owned by Procter and Gamble, definitely isn\'t what it used to be.  I gave this product two stars instead of one simply because those with finer facial hair may have better luck with this product than I had.    "

To be Honest, this is the best toothbrush I\'ve ever owned.  I have been using the floss head with the braces and my lord does it do a great job! My teeth feel like I just got out of the dentists office, and it gets anything out of my teeth that get stuck due to the braces.  Another huge plus is that its able to get in everywhere with hardly any pressure which is great because I had concerns about bleeding, plaque buildup + getting white streaks on my teeth.  Overall the Oral-B is easy to use, the silly little smiley face lets you know when the 2 minutes are up as well as the brush heads pulsing. I rinse off the unit and remove/rinse the head and keep it in the holder and everything stays nice and neat.

Subsequently, I have tried many different types of depilatories (lotions, potions, waxes, razor blades and the like). God knows, I have the cuts and scars to prove it. If you looked at my legs, you would see a road map of scrapes from past dalliances with razors. Many have come and gone. Frankly, I was often not even looking for quality - I was just looking for a quick, (relatively) fast way to remove unwanted stubble.Low and behold - I happened to read some reviews of Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, complete with 1 Razor and 2 Women\'s Razor Refill Cartridges. The women who used them seemed pleased, so, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring. Sure enough, the simply packaged product arrived at my home, just yesterday. In need of a touch up job, I decided to try my hand at this blade. I must say, I was very pleased. It didn\'t feel like I was even shaving! That was how smooth the razor glided down my legs, and under my arms. The moisture strip definitely did the trick. No ashy, flakey skin or the pain I come to associate with razor burn. The shave was close, too. I don\'t see stubble, after nearly twelve hours - which is unheard of, for me. I am from Lebanese/Latino/Indo European stock.

I have sensitive skin and I\'m always complaining about not getting a close enough shave without tearing my face up, so when I saw the commercial for Proglide I decided to give it a go.  It\'s sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.  I\'ll say this, it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  When I\'ve waited a few days before using, the Proglide is a dream.  It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  Sadly, I\'ve noticed that if I shave two days in a row my skin gets irritated and the shave is nowhere near as close.  I know that some consider the battery operated vibration to be a mere gimmick, but having used a razor with the same capability for years I have found that my shave is always closer WITH the vibration, and I\'m quick to replace the battery because of that.  Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it\'s worth it (as far as I\'m concerned).  When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.  All in all, I like this product.  It delivers most of the time; I just wish it were always.    "

If you are not an everyday shaver (sometimes I don\'t shave on the weekends or holiday breaks) you will suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth of growth.

The clock/timer is a nice feature, makes me more aware of how much time I spend on different sections of teeth.  The motor hesitates when too much pressure is applied which is also a plus for me as I have a tendency to press too hard.  I\'ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don\'t use the stand that it came with but it\'s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn\'t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I\'ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.

No matter where you look (Amazon, CVS, etc..), they\'re just pricey.  I wouldn\'t mind it so much except for the fact that one razor doesn\'t last very long.  One razor gives me about 6-7 shaves before it starts scratching and cutting me.  I don\'t know but I just feel they should last longer at this price.  It kind of reminds of \'the printer ink price scam\'.  You know, like when HP sells a great printer for $75 but charges $20 for a single ink cartridge.

I thought I\'d try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush since the price fits our budget better. Unfortunately, I think the Sonicare experience set the bar too high and the Oral-b toothbrush did not meet my expectations.Oral-b features I liked:-Lightweight (lighter than the Sonicare)-Compact head-Bristles rotate and get in between teeth fairly well, but seem a little harsh along the gum line-InexpensiveHere\'s how the Sonicare one is better than the Oral-b one:-The Sonicare has a slimmer brush head \'neck\' between the bristles and the base/handle; the Oral-b one feels awkward because it\'s thicker-Sonicare has adjustable timing in 30 second increments up to 3 minutes, with auto shut-off; Oral-b has an alert that goes off at 2 minutes, but it doesn\'t turn off and it\'s not adjustable-The Sonicare brush/bristles have a plastic cover for when toothbrush is not in use; Oral-b just stays exposed when not in use, much like a regular toothbrush-The Oral-b toothbrush is louder than the Sonicare toothbrushOverall, I felt like my teeth were very clean, except along the gum line where I was hesitant to direct the Oral-b brush since it\'s a little harsher than my Sonicare (and I have sensitive gums already). I think it does a better job cleaning teeth than a standard toothbrush. It takes a little getting used to, but it\'s a step towards healthier oral care if you don\'t already use an electric toothbrush."

I was skeptical because I have been using its direct competitor for about a year, the top-of-the-line Sonicare Flexcare HX6950 with UV Sanitizer, and was very happy with that brush.  A friend of mine has the Oral-B smart series, and when I saw it, I knew I had to give it a try to see what all the hype was about.  I found the opportunity when my father asked me to order him one, so I threw in an extra one for myself.  It arrived in two days from Amazon, brand spanking new.I\'ve used the Orab-B for about a week, 14 times, and I have to say its different than the Sonicare, not necessarily better, but just different, and just as good.  The Oral-B gives you a different kind of clean, and I definitely feel my teeth and gums get a really, really good cleaning after brushing.  My teeth also seem whiter now.  I think the Oral-B removes more plaque off my teeth, and more food from between my teeth due to the optional Floss Action brush head I\'ve been using.  Don\'t be fooled, there is no substitution for flossing, but this brush head does a little for you, especially if you have bigger natural gaps between your teeth, of which I don\'t, so I have to floss.  The Floss Action brush head is really amazing, quite an innovation, and I love it.The wireless SmartGuide is pretty clever too.  It automatically goes on when you turn your toothbrush on.  I can definitely say, that the SmartGuide helps you to brush longer and more thoroughly.  Its almost like a trainer when your brushing, rooting for you to finish 30 seconds on each setting.  I do one cycle for the top teeth, and one cycle for the bottom teeth.  The SmartGuide is very helpful to anyone, no matter your age.  The four different stages of this electric toothbrush are also very helpful, I use them all, and always will.The Oral-B Smart Series 5000 comes with one Floss Action brush head, and one Pro White brush head.  I also ordered a 4 pack of sensitive brush heads, but haven\'t used them yet.  In addition, after seeing how much I like the Floss Action brush head, I ordered more of those, a 3 pack actually.  If your wondering about the price, forget about it, its totally worth it, and will probably save you thousands of dollars worth of needless dental work due to cavities.  I can\'t recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush enough.  In fact, if you have the money, be generous and buy them for other people that can\'t afford one.  Everyone should be able to use one of these, they are that beneficial to oral hygiene.  I can\'t imagine using a regular toothbrush after using an electric one, especially an electric on of this quality.As usual, Amazon is amazing for price, shipping, product quality, and customer service, literally the best store on the planet.  I don\'t even understand how other stores can stay in business with Amazon in existence.  I stopped keeping track of how much money I\'ve spent here in the past 10 years..lol."

The blades felt like they were scraping too closely against my skin and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience, without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.A year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!) instead of buying a new razor altogether. The experience was completely different from what I remembered! The razor just glided over my skin, I never felt like I had to go back over areas, it was incredibly comfortable, and, most importantly, an extremely close shave!Surprised, I wondered what it could be, and realized that it might be the blades making the difference. I picked up some Fusion Power replacements and tried them side by side and it confirmed for me - the Fusion Power blades are markedly worse than the regular Fusion blades.Don\'t believe me?

The review by Cherise Everhard nails it.LONG VERSION: Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty must be reclining comfortably in her mansion in the Pantheon subdivision on Mount Olympus, counting the revenue from her licensing deal with Gillette. The sale of the razor blades alone must be quite profitable, allowing her to fill her closets with designer togas.This is one of those products that get written about in marketing studies. Where the basic item, a computer printer, for example, has a reasonable retail price but the ink refills are the longterm profit center. In this case, the razor is quite a good value, the price of the razor blades, however, leave you breathless!I myself was seduced by the allure of Venus when a women\'s magazine named the Venus Embrace Razor one of the beauty innovations of the year. (Yes, I read women\'s magazines! So what? This is a women\'s product! If you are a guy reading this review, you can just take off your judgemental hat and go back to watching the droning ball game on the sofa where you usually repose. Relax, have a beer!)Not being able to purchase Mach 2 razor blades anywhere for any price was causing me upset. I had a perfectly good razor that was totally useless. I bought a Soleil. It was French. It was pink-orange and white like a creamsicle. It was curved like a dolphin. It had three blades which was one more than the Mach 2 had. I was unimpressed.So, there I was, with a three bladed razor thinking that this was not nearly enough.Listen, hair removal is a tricky business. There are multiple solutions to the problem, some very, very bad and some very, very good. With chemotherapy and radiation being the very worst solutions, the best solution, in my admittedly fairly limited experience, is waxing. Unfortunately there are times when waxing is inconvenient. Like 10 minutes before you are planning to leave for the beach and you feel some stubble on your ankles. This is when you really need a razor.So I read about the Venus Embrace being an innovation of the year and I was hooked.What you get when you buy the \'starter kit\' is:- A pretty, ergonomically curved razor that has \'attractive sea foam green and turquoise\' (purple and teal) colored gel inserts on the handle. These cause a squishy/sticky feel that is not unpleasant but somewhat odd.... like holding a silicone spatula or a dog toy. The manufacturer claims that these gel inserts cause the razor handle to sit more firmly in the hand and not to slip.-The blade. The \'business end\' of the razor is HUGE! Its an oval shaped disk that contains five \'spring mounted\' blades that are surrounded by wide areas of plastic covered by variously colored slippery coatings that the manufacturer describes as \' Protective Ribbon of Moisture\'.-An extra razor cartride which comes packed in a clever, water-proof, sealed plastic container.-A plastic \'Shower Pod\' which is a small holder for the razor and extra blades that is supposed to attach to the bathroom tile with a suction cup.The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is the sticky/squishy feel of the razor handle. The blade cartridge sits safely in its sealed plastic container and is easily inserted on to the handle.The blade is sized perhaps for true Olympians like Venus Williams rather than mere mortal-sized women such as I. Did I mention is is HUGE? Paul Bunyon huge. Yo, Venus! Did you actually approve the size of this cartridge? I bet not.The shower pod is a tacky plastic thing that would not stay suctioned to my tile wall. It went directly into the trash.Although the razor head pivots, the blades are \'spring loaded\', there are moisture strips, and the handle is curved and tricked out with gel inserts, the Venus Embrace razor is unwieldy. It just doesn\'t go where you want it to go when you want it to go there. And when it goes there you don\'t really get such a close shave. I don\'t notice any better shaving than with my old Mach 2.What I have noticed about the Venus Embrace is that I have not cut myself once and I have not experienced razor burn. These were not significant problems with my Mach 2 but I thought I should mention them.My fundamental saddness with this product arrived when I needed to purchase additional blades and sticker shock set in. Three buckeroos a cartridge makes one think once or twice about continuing to use this razor. Sorry Goddess Venus, but that\'s one Sister\'s opinion.    "

For me it has changed the way I feel about shaving tenfold. The fusion was good but I still had issues with razor burn. The proglide changed all that. Usually I go about a day in between shaving. After buying the Proglide on Saturday and shaving that evening, I didn\'t shave till Tuesday night & that\'s cause I wanted to. I could have went a couple more days but I like a smooth head so I shaved. I couldn\'t believe how close a shave I got with this blade and went for days without any razor burn or irritation at all and that\'s going with the grain. I always liked going against the grain cause it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was, my head couldn\'t take the pain afterwards so I stuck with going with the grain. With the Proglide I\'m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road I\'ll give it a shot because just going with the grain I get a damn close shave. I know it won\'t be the case for some other people but for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years. Highly, HIGHLY recommend buying this prduct.    "

My shave was smooth and nick free and the blades stayed sharp for several shaves. I included some pics of the product packaging so people can compare the product they are receiving to the ones I got. I have ordered Mach 3 blades from Ebay in the past and received horrible razors packaged in what looked like official packaging but made out of cardboard instead of the plastic that the retail ones come one.

I hated shaving every other day as I found the shave quite uncomfortable. But with my ever increasing stubble, I wanted to find an alternative.I found this one at Kroeger and decided to give it a try. I was very impressed with the shave, it was very smooth and much more comfortable than any two blade razor. What was most impressive was it cut far less than the other razors. The turbo option doesnt really improve the shaving experience though and so I shave without the turbo power. I do have to shave on the same spots again but I do not feel any discomfort as compared to the other razors. The trimming blade too is useful especially when working on the sideburns and underneath the neck, but it takes some time to figure out the \'correct\' way of holding the handle in this position.But alas, all good things have a price and this one might be too expensive in the long run. I will have to see how many shaves my blades last to get the economics right.In short, if you are still stuck with two blades and want to move to better options, I highly recommend this razor if you can afford the blades in the long run.

I\'m done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave.  Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other \'detail\' parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front.  It just doesn\'t work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use.

There are several reasons. It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs. This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it. However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you\'ll read the toothbrush page. This is a page for replacement heads.There\'s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts. There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17. I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they\'re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!  This particular item is three heads.  You can easily find the best deal by taking a look at all the products offered on Amazon, and dividing the cost by the number of heads.

The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct.

Very happy!","First of all, a comment on the price...This is an amazing price for the Oral-B 5000. I just saw them yesterday (Jan. 15, 2011) at my local Target store for 159.00 with no rebate offers. So, getting one here through Amazon for under a hundred is a great buy! Not only was 96.00 a great price, but mine also came with a 50% mail-in rebate offer, which was a nice surprise. So, after that I will have only paid 48 bucks! Awesome! My girlfriend also got the rebate with hers. I don\'t know how long the rebates will last, but even without the rebate, this is an excellent price, and well worth every penny!After reading all the reviews here, and talking to my dentist about it and hearing his recommendation, my girlfriend took the plunge and ordered one a couple weeks ago. As soon as she tried it, she fell in love with it. She told me how good it felt on her teeth, and how clean her mouth felt after using it, and how she really looked forward to brushing. I immediately ordered mine the same day.My first impressions on the build quality...After opening and unpacking mine, I was immediately impressed with the build quality of the unit. The brush handle is solid and seems very well constructed, and the head that holds the brushes seems strong. I fully expect this to last a long time, and hold up really well. It\'s also attractive to look at, and the batteries last a long time on a full charge.This model comes with a separate wireless display unit, that displays brushing information while you\'re using it, and functions as a clock when you\'re not brushing. It displays a timer that will countdown from 2:00 minutes, or count up depending on your preference. It also shows the quadrants of your teeth for a visual reminder to make sure you get all areas. It displays which brushing mode you\'re using, and will flash a warning if you press too hard.Is the display really necessary? Perhaps not... The brush unit will vibrate each 30 or 45 seconds to remind you to change to the next quadrant. And it will stutter when the time is up to let you know you\'ve completed the recommended time. But, it is nice to have those visual cues where you can see them easily, and it is nice to have a small bathroom clock handy. So, I really like the display unit a lot. I think it was a nice addition, and I think most people will appreciate it.My impressions on actually using the brush...I\'ve had mine only a week so far, but I love it completely! I honestly think this is one of the best investments in my health I\'ve ever made. I\'ve never taken care of my teeth like I should have, and I have several fillings to show for it. I\'ve always tried to brush at least twice a day, but they were always short, quick brushes, by hand, and not very thorough. And I never thought I would be excited about brushing, until now.Now, I love brushing. I look forward to it. I brush at least three times a day, and never less than two minutes each time. I love how long the battery lasts, so I can take it with me to work, or on trips. This brush really makes it easy to stay on top of brushing. I can feel how thoroughly each tooth is getting cleaned, and it feels good on my teeth and gums. I haven\'t experienced any discomfort using mine.After brushing, my teeth are literally squeeky clean. It really does feel like a professional cleaning. It\'s only been a week with mine, but I can already notice a difference in their appearance. I\'m excited to see how they will look after a couple months.One last thing I really like is the carrying case that comes with it. It holds the brush firmly in place, and two brush heads firmly in place. Very convenient for carrying with me.This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I can\'t even imagine going back to a manual brush. I highly recommend this, and I\'m sure you will enjoy it just as much.Hope that helps..."

It\'s one of those things that I don\'t like to do.  So when I bought this razor with its promises, I found myself waking up excited to see if the shaver was really a cut above the rest.I\'ve never used one of these battery razors but had wanted to.  The 5 blades scared me a bit too....ouch, would that really hurt!  To my surprise, and delight....the thing ROCKS!It does give a smooth shave and seems to save me time...to my surprise.  Like others have mentioned, it is a bit bigger so a bit tougher to get under the nose....but it\'s doable.  The extra edge blade on the top is kind of cool...but I have only used it a few times.I think the three things that make this work are (1), battery vibration, (2) part under the blade that hits your skin first before the blades do....seems to lift the beard so blades cut better and, (3) five blades...5 makes a difference but the big difference is the closeness of the blades.  It seems this closeness makes it less likely that the blades cut me.  I seem to get less razor cuts.The only drawback I can see is the cost...I have had a hard time justifying the cost of razors in the past...seem too expensive, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.I highly recommend you try it.  By the way, shaving in the shower for 22 years...only use a mirror half the time.  Way to go.  I also highly recommend Aveeno shaving cream.    "

I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  I brush twice a day, on and off with Seonsodyne Whitenting and Sensodyne Pronamel. I also ensured that I used the \'Whitening\' brush setting that the toothbrush offers. Between the two photos, I noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not very much.  My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  So I\'d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  It would probably be nice to have it your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don\'t expect too much.  It might be somewhat of a gimmick that it \'whitens\' teeth, but if you look at what the item is called--Pro White, it is designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth and make them a little whiter.  SO in all fairness, I\'d say that it works as it should without huge results that people may expect of it."

Any retail store you go to this is going to be around $140-$160.I will start with the pros. The first time I started using the Oral B 5000 toothbrush I noticed how clean my teeth felt after brushing. I have been using this product for over a month now and love the pressure sensor. That is the main reason why I bought this product is because I have a habit of brushing hard. It has 4 dedicated modes which are great and one mode with extended time. I switch modes pretty much every time I use it. My teeth are getting slightly whiter after a month. The wireless brushing guide/clock is really handy so you can see what mode you are on and how much time you have been brushing. The charging base is great and very portable compared to other models.Now the cons. There are only a few things that I can think of that aren\'t that great with this toothbrush. The display mode on the handle really bugs me. It just displays the battery and nothing else. This is pretty pointless especially when you travel. Because it doesn\'t tell you which mode you are in so you have to go by feel to figure which mode you want. The display of the battery is so large it makes me wonder how much battery it drains to display that thing because its always on. That brings me to my next point is the life of the battery. It says in the manual that the life is 10 days. But seems to be less than that. My girlfriend has the 4000 and hers lasts longer than mine. Her display is for the battery is smaller and in the corner of the display instead of enourmous and in the middle.

I find myself wrapping my thumb around the handle to hold it while brushing and, sometimes inadvertently, hitting the Mode button. So, I\'ll be brushing in one mode and then the brush will switch to a different mode -- this makes me have to hit the Mode button 3-4 times to cycle back through to the mode I want to use. Again, this is my fault, but I also blame it on the design of the brush.2) I find the brush head bristles to be way too hard/harsh. I have these brush heads: Floss Action, Precision Clean and Pro White. I am going to buy the so-called Sensitive brush head and give it a try.

I\'m not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick.  I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it.  Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out.  I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades.

So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it\'s no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn\'t bump sensors off the shelves.

It\'s very poor performance.  I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger and last very long time (now they no longer make this model).  One difference I could find is that the good one was made in Germany and poor one was made in China.  I am not saying this is the reason but I am certainly recommending don\'t buy this model if anyone is considering.  I will give this a rating of zero star if that\'s an option."

6229,3056,3142,20111217,B0043VYSI2,5,"December 17, 2011",A2H2HDAZCKDSSO,Good Toothbrush,I\'ve been using an Oral B for many years now.  I\'m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  When you have teeth that are not straight like I do the back sides of your teeth are very hard to reach and the smaller round head on the brush I find reaches the hard to get areas better than the longer rectangular brushes.  Doesn\'t straighten your teeth though.  Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I\'m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  I tend to think that is glamor over substance.  After all the brush is just rotating in an oscillating motion purre and simple.  It works and works well.  My model hesistates at the end of two minutes and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  You still need to floss and thats expected.  I have been very pleased with my last unit.  I didn\'t save the box and the model number isn\'t on it so I cant say which one it is.  I\'ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  Good product and will continue to use till new technology comes up with something better.

It\'s great for people on the go, easy to put in a gym bag etc. It\'s also less stuff cluttering your shower, which I\'m down for. On first use, it works great. Shaves easily, no nicks, close shave. It is a little stringy( seeing little strings of gel from the razor to your skin), but it doesn\'t really make a difference using it, its just a little odd. My legs felt nice afterwards, not parched and dry. But I always follow up with a shea body butter when I get out of the shower anyway, so that\'s never been a big concern of mine.The down side is that the shaving gel bar part is going to be gone long before the razor(maybe after 3-4 uses). I use my Venus cartridges probably longer then most...1: because I\'m not obsessed with the closest shave ever and 2: because I feel guilt pangs whenever I throw something like this in the garbage(trying to be green here!). So eventually I know I\'ll be using this particular razor with my traditional shaving cream despite the fact that it started off easy-peasy. Would I buy it again? Maybe if I saw the cartridges on super sale. But on the whole, I\'m doing just fine with my other venus \'divine\' razor.    "

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos "

Otherwise, if you are happy with your current product/price, we see no compelling reason to switch. "

However, this razor really pulls at the underarms while shaving, and my underarms were quite senstive after shaving. Plus, this razor is pretty big (got to put 5 blades and a moisture ribbon somewhere), and that made it difficult to see while shaving my underarms.The storage pod for the shower? Clever idea, but try getting the thing open with wet hands. I\'ve found that it either pops open when I want it closed or won\'t open when I need it.Overall, this is a great razor for the legs. I like the smooth, close shave that it provides. However, after my underarm experience on 2 different occasions, I won\'t even attempt to use this for bikini areas (ouch). It\'s a bit too bulky for detail work, I think. That means I have to have 2 different razors, and that\'s a bit much.

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

Also, I go through these blades faster than I ever have with a single or 3-blade system. And lastly, the razor cuts my face. The 5 blades is supposed to make the experience easier but it doesn\'t. I never cut myself with 3-blade systems. Overall, this is a horrible razor and I encourage you to look to others.    "

The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves.  That was an excellent product.  However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model.  I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be.  I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none.  I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal?  Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product?  That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one?  If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off.  I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it.  So much for my customer loyalty.  I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.    "

Never having used an electric toothbrush before I was a bit skeptical of its abilities. But, I have been using it for a few days now and have to echo another\'s comment that my teeth have never felt \'cleaner\' before. I too only use the deep clean setting with the sensitive brush. I also want to echo the comment about the manual\'s description of setting up the timer/clock. It took me a few tries to actually get the 12/24 hour setting changed because I thought I was pressing the correct button (but it turned out I wasn\'t). Now that it is set correctly I have no complaints (and having a clock on my sink is an added and welcome feature)."

Then one day the evil nemesis time took it all away as my Sonic powered toothbrush ceased pulsing its distinctive sound of a million mad mosquitoes.  My wife, as she is wont to do,never wanting anything to do with my inter-spatial toothbrush saw this as the opportunity to finally throw it in the trash. For days it lay in state at the bottom of the can. It was a vision of pure sadness as I knew that now, once again, my elbow must flex and my hand once again must clench the minuscule handle of (gulp)...a manual toothbrush. The thought of losing another energized brush kept me away so for years I maintained only memories of the mad mosquitoes that once blasted calculus to the oblivion. If I had only had that Sonic brush in Mr. Farkner\'s math class, I often thought, perhaps I would have passed. I spoke often to my wife about finding another sonic calculus blaster but this brought only glares. For, as I have previously stated, my wife hated every tiny sonic wave of it\'s tiny brush and nearly forbid it.As I sat in the body conforming chair of my dental hygiene adviser, mirror in hand, viewing my pearly off-whites the bad news came; word by grating word; \'You\'re a lousy brusher\'. These words came from a mouth I could not even see.  Was it true? Is this why she protected her mouth from mine with that veil? For the second time in my life I learned calculus is no fun as she told me I must return for two whole hours of scraping. And it was all my fault. \'This\' she proclaimed after quickly unveiling her mouth \'is an Oral-B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush. and it alone is the answer to your inadequacy\' Wow, it was a mouthful and I was not even sure I could utter that many words without removing the cotton from my cheeks but I still tried. \'A mmmpphh, mmmphh\'. I gave up protesting further only in my mind. \'But it has no sonic drive!\' I though. Seeming to read my thoughts she smiled and curled my fingers around the handle. \'It has modes, lots of modes, and the brush is big, big enough to massage your gums, and who doesn\'t like a gum massage...right?\' I pondered her words as she veiled her mouth again and scraped her way slowly through my calculus problems.As I left her presence, and all the way home on the bus, her words rang in my head. At the first opportunity I searched the World Wide Web for the best price and found a quick trip to the Amazon was in order. I pushed the right buttons and soon it arrived, wrapped incognito in it\'s brown cardboard box with that winky smile. Inside, nestled against it\'s plastic air pillow my new toothbrush rested from it\'s long journey. The air was electric as I pulled it from it\'s packaging and plugged it in. I hung it\'s cordless timer on the wall. I could hardly wait to massage my gums but the book clearly stated I must so I did. When morning came I grabbed the handle. No more clenched fist around a minuscule handle, this baby was large, form fitted to my hand and pulsed with excitement. I pushed the button . The brush came to life. Gone was the sound of a million angry mosquitoes on a mission of blood replaced instead with a sound of raw rotating power. The sound was humanly audible and no longer called dogs from every outside quadrant. At first my elbow still flexed back and forth, as though I were to do the work, but I soon learned I need only relax, position the brush over each tooth and let the Oral-B work. The timer on the wall counted up the seconds. Thirty seconds later the brushed pulsed on and off and I was off to attack a new quadrant.  In just two minutes I was done. The brush had solved my calculus problems for the day and the timer even smiled its approval. Awesome!"

I shaved my legs twice without replacing the head, and the second time was really not that satisfactory. In addition, the refills are PRICEY! They end up being over $2 apiece at the Amazon price or more than $3 apiece at the regular retail price.* The multiple blades trap longer hairs, so if it\'s been more than a couple of days since you\'ve last shaved your legs (so sue me -- it\'s not exactly shorts weather in Michigan right now!), you\'ll find yourself CONSTANTLY rinsing out the head.

I know most people don\'t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn\'t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!Ok now for the research details:1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it\'s time to brush on another side.6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you9. It\'s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn\'t like to brush or doesn\'t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. It guides you so you know you are getting a great cleaning. Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it!

This razor just took care of all the business there like it was baby fine hair (which it was NOT).I like the fact that it comes with a suction cup razor holder but be sure to place this strategically in your shower or bathtub so no water runs directly on it because it will lose suction and you don\'t want to have water pouring over the Olay moisture bars.  I have used this razor for at least two weeks now (a total of 8 times) and the moisture bar does not look to have dwindled in size at all.  The blades (5 of them!) still seem ultra sharp.I definitely recommend this razor and honestly...I might toss the Mach one in the trash and use this baby full time.

The top part of the brush goes in circles and the lower part of the brush goes up and down and really gets in there-- and without irritating!The timer is great also! Sometimes I feel like I am rushing when I brush my teeth, but with the built in 2 minute timer, I know that I am not exactly rushing through and well, its doing a great job in those 2 minutes.I am not finding any left over food when I floss afterwards either which really shows that this toothbrush is doing its job.Also, since this is rechargeable, I dont have to worry about constantly changing the battery- so that saves time and money!!There is an extra toothbrush head that I decided to use one and my husband the other one.

The Hydra Gel that I am currently use really allows the blades of my Fusion razor to smoothly glide over my face. Another plus is that I only use a drop. I drop the size of a dime is plenty to generate a nice lather on one side of my face. So, basically, 3 dime size gel drop will get the whole face covered in a great lather. One can should last me a couple of months I assume. If I use too much my face tends to be left with kind of a film on it from the gel.

But also, it takes finding the right one to suit all of your needs. This though isn\'t completely one of them with the Gilette Fusion Proglide Power Razor. This battery-operated razor is easy to setup, and place in a simple AAA battery. The gripe though is that the blades get quickly dull after a few uses and you\'d either have to get a new set of razor blades, or consider buying a razor sharpener. It does handle well otherwise, but Gilette needs to find less-expensive ways to get a shave that fits for what it is worth.Price: CConvience: C+Overall: C 1/2+    "

My face was burning after my first shave and sprouted little red bumps. I wanted to make sure the razor was to blame and not something else so for the next two days I shaved my face half and half: Fusion on one side. Mach 3 on the other. On the second day I switched sides. The result? Every time I shaved, the burning side of my face had just been shaved by the fusion. The Mach 3 side was just fine.That burning sensation must me the shave was closer/better right? Wrong. Both sides of my face are equally smooth from both a visual and tactile inspection.

My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.

When I first used it, I could almost feel it break up any buildup on my teeth.  It truly felt like I just had my regular cleaning at the dentist.Besides the fact that the brush actually delivers on the results, the design is very well thought out.  The handle is slim and light and as easy to hold as a regular toothbrush.  The head vibration is well isolated from the handle and does not cause any discomfort.  The whole brush is completely water proof and can be washed easily.  There are no visible contacts for charging.  It just sits in the base and charges (I assume by induction) perfectly fine.It has a couple of settings for brushing or massaging and although I prefer the brushing setting for regular brushing, the massaging setting felt nice on my gums.  It has a reminder in the form of a brief pause every thirty seconds to facilitate proper brush timing.The brush comes with an additional smaller head that is meant to clean between the teeth.  It also does an excellent job at breaking up any particles and cleaning the space between the teeth and along the gum line.This is a very well built and thought out brush and I highly recommend it."

We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist\'s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn\'t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn\'t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don\'t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn\'t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth."

Thought I could get a sonicare like my sis, but it was so much more expensive and seems to be a bit high maintenance. Tried the Oral-B Vitality with the floss action brush head and it was amazing! It was gentle on my gums, no bleeding, and the bristles did a great job of leaving my mouth feeling very clean."
