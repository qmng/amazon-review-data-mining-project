The adhesive,on the back of this pad, makes it , stay put for all day long . I am amazed at how many different brands there are, and I have tried several..and  These are by far, the best.I would highly recommend them. what an awsome product!!"
358,361,20110905,B004J36GES,5,"September 5, 2011",A2V55J9CCQCOG0,The Cadillac of pads,"Super absorbent with a faint not unpleasant scent that counteracts perfectly. They\'re long and, when properly placed, you can\'t even feel them. I already use them - I just reviewed them so I could get a free box! : ) Great product!"
126,126,20111011,B0029NYQ2E,5,"October 11, 2011",A2M82H7ZSQOS0Q,thin and comfortable,"I have been always used ALWAYS, however this new product line is even better. Very thin and comfortable, and the protection is good as well."
419,423,20120404,B006MJ2AGU,5,"April 4, 2012",AQ7M70TX1NWYG,great product,wished they had come up with this long time ago. definitely worth the money. very absorbent. would definitely recommend. it\'s better to buy them online though. at the store they always overcharge...so stock up!
161,161,20111231,B0029NYQ6A,5,"December 31, 2011",A2AWZ10ZWPJUXC,Always Maxi Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings,No matter what brand of pads I buy I come back to Always. These pads do protect overnight and you can sleep instead of making all those trips to the bathroom at night. If you have a problem with super extra heavy flow nothing is going to work but if not use these. I like the added feature of wings as they provide extra protection. The adhesive strip is really strong and they won\'t slip. I wouldn\'t buy any other pad but Always as they\'re reliable and top quality. You can\'t get any better. It\'s worth it.
90,90,20110208,B0029NYPY8,5,"February 8, 2011",A2IEK7OUWM4NJQ,Always Feminine Wipes,"Fresh, clean, wonderful! NO alcohol smell, wet but not dripping, and simply the best! The smell is just perfect- easy breezy and just clean smelling- nothing overwhelming or offensive. Just clean! It\'s worth the price!"
35,35,20100621,B001GCTTJY,5,"June 21, 2010",A2X08GL05CR8ZF,One of the best pads ever,"For the cost of the pads, this has to be one of the best pads out there on the market. For women who have a heavy flow, this type of pad can hold up quite well without any spills or staining on clothing/bedsheets."
176,176,20110829,B0029NYQ6A,1,"August 29, 2011",A1Q8GYCJ71223K,Diaper time!,"Well, first off this pad is like a DIAPER! Sorry if some of you ladiesfelt otherwise but this pad is WAY too large, long, and cumbersome.It measures about 15\' long and at least 6\' inches across at widestpoint where the wings are. They are so uncomfortable. Maybe it\'s cause I am only 5\'0\' and only 120 lbs. I guess you have to be a BIG, BIG woman to appreciate these pads! So, if your flow isn\'t abnormally heavy or you are a petite lady, do not buy these."
101,101,20120328,B0029NYQ1K,5,"March 28, 2012",A3R5HY5P3JETXZ,the best out there,"Amazing! They\'re so soft and feel like memory foam. Other pads feels sticky or plasticy and drive me crazy, but these are the BEST. Only pads ill ever use now. They\'re so thin, yet they absorb so well and stay dry. Worth every penny."
15,15,20101201,B001G7QUZU,1,"December 1, 2010",ASX507Q5GB7I8,Not very good,"I purchased the always overnight pads without wings by accident.I was wanting to get the ones WITH wings instead because that is what I normally use.Instead of going through the hassle of returning this product I thought I\'d try it out.I am not happy with these at all! Since their are no wings,it leaks all over the sides of my underwear EVERY TIME.Now I know why I never wanted to buy pads without wings before.If you\'ve never used pads without wings,don\'t try it now! They suck!"
357,360,20110909,B004J36GES,5,"September 9, 2011",A9XMQ24ZKXYSN,Great odor and leakage control,"I was skeptical about these maxi pads, as I normally use the ultra-thin pads with wings. These pads are thicker than ultra thins, but still comfortable and not diaperish to wear.  I was concerned about leakage without wings, but after using these I\'ve decided wings are required for ultra thins but not these maxis - there is zero side leakage.  The scent is so subtle that at first I did not realize these pads are scented.  While I prefer an ultra thin pad, these are definitely not my mom\'s thick, pseudo-diapers from my teen years."
180,180,20110424,B0029NYQ6A,5,"April 24, 2011",A267SPU8FBONBU,These are a god send!!!!,"On my quest to fight an overnighter that truly does provide protection, this was my last stop! They truly provide maximum protection! As the other reviewers before me stated, I too had to use towels, double up on overnight pads and use a tampon just to go to sleep without the worry of staining! I am truly glad Always decided to make a product that delivers! I hated going to bed with a tampon, risking getting Toxic Shock syndrome, but it was the only thing that somewhat worked.There is nothing bad to say about this product! I don\'d mind the bulkiness of it, nor do I mind the length of it.Side Bar: But one thing I do have to note is that my menstrual started getting lighter since being diagnosed with anemia and taking iron pills daily. A heavy period is not normal, so for those experiencing a heavy cycle, check with your doc.A lot of my symptoms (extreme cramping, heavy clotting, heavy flow, etc), besides PMS, have subsided since taking iron pills, working out and eating more healthy foods. I keep these pads on deck and only use these pads maybe once during my cycle on my most heavy day, which isn\'t nearly as heavy as it once was. So they have lasted me for quite a while.Sorry for the side bar, but I had to add that in there in case some of you have been wondering why you are having such heavy cycles.At any rate, this product works! Go out and get it and keep it in stock for your just in case days!"
232,233,20110216,B0029NYQEC,5,"February 16, 2011",A2ZJ835WQ7JNGT,best pantyliner,"This pantyliner is perfect for me because it is very absorbent, but is the size of a regular pantyliner, instead of a pad.  I use them daily between cycles.  These pantyliners have actually prevented yeast infections for me, which I was getting every several months with other pantyliners that were not as absorbent.  They always adhere very well for me.  All the stores where I shop stopped carrying the regular size, so I am so happy that Amazon carries these, and for a much better price than I was paying!  Always Dri-liners also makes a Long pantyliner, which is wider and longer.  I use those too when I need more coverage, like for light days of my cycle."
130,130,20110903,B0029NYQ2E,5,"September 3, 2011",A2ZMMQ4W17EK2N,The best switch ever,"Have been using these for over a year now, & I love them. Even though they are expensive I always luck up on a coupon when I need more. Now that i have found these on amazon I will start buying them from here instead of from the store. Since if I buy these in the store I would be paying $14.00 for two boxes. Great save, great deal, great product."

256,258,20111209,B003CP1590,5,"December 9, 2011",A3FCOQQU10XUQV,Great product.,"I\'ve tried so many brands, but always go back to Always (yes, pun intended).  This product is reliable, comfortable and affordable.  I\'ve never had an \'accident\' because it really is super-absorbent."
336,339,20111020,B004J36GES,5,"October 20, 2011",A1WKEAS58297E5,Does the job!,"What can you say about pads? Either they do the job or they don\'t. These do the job! We were happy with their performance under such \'conditions.\' We have two pad-wearing females in our house and I have to say, we go through the sanitary napkins. As always, this is the best brand. Always brand seems to do the best job providing protection from embarrassing messes and odors."
295,298,20110910,B003CP15AE,4,"September 10, 2011",A3M7R4PD0FEPUB,Easiest winged napkin to use.,"I usually hate pads with wings, but they\'ve made these pads incredibly easy to use. There is only strip of paper over the wings to deal with and you don\'t have to worry about pulling it off until the pad is already secure. I do prefer the scented pads, but these are quite absorbent without feeling heavy, so it\'s an easy trade-off.  These are by far the most thoughtfully packaged pads as well.  You simply open at the tab and pull off the pad.  Genius.I think the equivalent Stayfree pads feel fresh longer and last a little longer, but these pads feel thinner."
340,343,20110929,B004J36GES,4,"September 29, 2011",A3C6CZC2JP67VK,They do what they suppose to.....,"I wasn\'t too keen about these maxi pads but being in that I participate in this program it gave me the opportunity to try them anyway. Like many others,  I normally use the ultra-thin pads with wings. These pads are thicker than ultra thins though, but still comfortable and not like I\'m wearing my 11 month old diapers. I was concerned about leakage without wings, but after using these I\'ve decided wings are required for ultra thins but not these maxis. These pads are a go, so I too recommend them."
253,255,20120405,B003CP1590,4,"April 5, 2012",AHUJB9FTS71RE,"No leakage, not uncomfortable","As awkward as it is to review an item like this, I have to say that these are the only pads I will use. Problems I\'ve had with other pads: too long, too short, too thick, not wide enough. These seem to be the right length, thickness, and absorbency. I like that you can buy more than one at a time through Amazon, as it is convenient to just have them shipped as you need them."
125,125,20111023,B0029NYQ2E,1,"October 23, 2011",A28N6SRQ4C22ME,Waste of money.,"I tried this product because I was intrigued by the commercial.  Wish I hadn\'t ... the adhesive doesn\'t stick to anything but itself, so the pad bunches, AND it doesn\'t absorb worth anything.  I ruined the clothes I was wearing for the first time in many years because these things don\'t absorb as quickly or as much as Always Ultra-Thin pads.  Plus, they\'re more expensive than the Ultra-Thins.  Bottom line: don\'t bother."

A woman I work with tried it at my suggestion and she was fairly spilling over with praise for it was the best night sleep she\'d had in a long time.  The small bottles are very handy as a take-along for weekend trips."
157,157,20120207,B0029NYQ6A,5,"February 7, 2012",A3MX3VZIAGB0A,where have you been all my life?,"Like other reviewers I had been looking for the perfect overnight pad without a success. Then I ran into these by Always. And wow! these are it. I no longer have to worry about staying in one position all night and what not to avoid staining my clothes or bed.I\'m a medium pant size, so these Always pads cover back and front without problem and they\'re also wide enough in the center. But Always also came out with a Maxi pad for women size 14 and up which is a great idea too. Not all women have the same feminine needs so why do they have to stick to one-size-fits-all pad? They shouldn\'t have to. Kuddos to Always."
109,109,20111025,B0029NYQ1K,5,"October 25, 2011",AUFB3GQJV10P0,Great for Fibroid sufferers,"I suffer from Fibroids and it becomes the most stressful time every month.  I\'ve used so may overnight brands during the daytime and had them fail on me.  I tell you, I feel secure riding the train to work and traveling over an hour to visit family.  I will have to admit though that I have to wear two Ultra tampons at the same time (yes two) while I wear the pad.  But if I used any other brand of pads I\'d be in trouble so this one buys me more time in between changes.  I dread using anything else when I fall asleep because I\'d have to get up several times a night. Always allows me to sleep and I only have to change once during the night.  So this will be my lifeling purchase, that is, until I remove these suckers!"
51,51,20101008,B001LK6QJW,1,"October 8, 2010",A1FVO9ZB49ZCXA,Tiny!,"I am a small person and these liners are TINY. They are not long and they are not wide either. I\'m talking DINKY. The description says \'Larger than our regular pad for overnight protection\' - I am scared to know how small their \'regular pad\' is, if this this considered the large size.I just spent $10.32 on them but I will have to go out to get some normal sizes. Don\'t waste your money!!!"
304,307,20110906,B003CP15AE,5,"September 6, 2011",A3HETHW2XD3DWH,Barely know they\'re there,"These ALWAYS pads are everything they claim to be.  With stay put wings, they don\'t shift, and the design is so thin you will forget you\'re even wearing a maxi pad.  These are unscented and come in a package of 16.  They are extremely absorbent and easy to dispose in a handy green wrapper when you are changing.  I hate bulk, but on heavy flow days there is sometimes no choice.  Now thanks to INFINITY pads, I have a choice, and my number one choice is Always Infinity."

It\'s ok for normal days, but this product is definitely not for \'heavy\' days. The ultra thin design is comfortable and while it a bit better than their usual pad, it\'s not enough for heavy days."
398,402,20090614,B005P0SMW8,5,"June 14, 2009",A2QXMEWCYVS50W,A must have!,"This is a product it would do everyone well to have as a staple in their homes.  It offers instant relief from stomach discomfort yet tastes like good spring water.  I prefer it chilled and keep some always ready in my fridge.  It also works as a topical for cuts or irritations.Our first experience with the product was after radiation burns when my husband was in treatment.  As the saliva glands had been destroyed and he needed to cary a water bottle all the time, we were told about George\'s Aloe Vera (none other will work as well). This became his saving grace.There are many many uses, it\'s pure and has taken awards for its excellence.  I try not to be without it and have ordered it for friends and family, especially those who have been ill.Ordering via Amazon.com has always been the best way to get the product as it is not available locally.  Every vendor has been exceptional in getting it to me."

And with these you don\'t feel gross, you\'re extremely comfortable, and they do absorb a lot more than the others. I still leak, but not as much. They\'re definitely not perfect, the wings are a bit too short and the pad itself isn\'t as wide as I\'d like, but I give it 5 stars because it\'s still the best pad on the market."
1,1,20120314,B0012IYKOG,5,"March 14, 2012",A37553726TM67U,GREAT,"I love the extra protection of length with these pads - I use them in daytime, for they don\'t feel bulky at all.  This is a very good price.  Very happy!"

As a nurse, I have heard every combination of pads and tampons for nighttime coverage.  Conducting some studies myself, I am convinced this is a superior product and will simplify the horrendous nighttime guessing game.  The pad can hold an amazing amount of flow without spilling onto bedlinens and is very comfortable.  Thanks for getting this one right at long last!"
110,110,20111024,B0029NYQ1K,1,"October 24, 2011",A29PSJ1U7QBZEL,Worst Pad I\'ve Ever Used,"These are, by far, the worst pad I\'ve ever used. I\'ve used them for two months and have found them to be non-obsorbent. They\'re also too slender, except in the back. I can\'t count how many accidents I\'ve had while wearing them. I would never buy them again. I\'m sticking with Always Ultra Thins and the regular thick pad in the blue bag."
339,342,20111002,B004J36GES,4,"October 2, 2011",A13HRBF6V8E8K2,Quality Maxi,"Always brand pads have been my choice of pad for years. Although I\'m used to using the pads with wings, since these pads are Always pads I figured I give them a chance. I tried these pads and true to the Always brand, these pads stood up. Now, they\'re somewhat thicker than the other Always pads that I\'m used to, but to my surprise they were still comfortable. I didn\'t have any leaks and when I put them in place, they stayed in place. So did these pads hold up to the quality of the Always brand? They sure did! Great quality pads!"

Thanks always and amazon for always helping consumers get what they want at the price they can afford(ugh i sound like a cheesy commericial slogan writer) but its true.the subscribe and save really works well for me for most stuff

I personally thought they were too thin to use for heavy days.  Anyway, the front part of the pad has holes, I guess for ventilation and the back part of the pad has lines.  I am not sure why the back part has lines.  The pad itself tells you which is the front and which is the back.I liked this pad alright.Would I buy it on my own?  No, because I like Kotex products better."

I usually don\'t like improvements because to me that is usually code for taking away something good about the product in order to make a cheaper product to produce and cut back on the quality.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with how well the new technology worked to absorb away from your body. Even on my heaviest days I didn\'t have any leaks and I didn\'t feel bulky as I sometimes can feel. The new design has a wider back and channels that help with faster absorption. The only problem that I have with this product is that the adhesive is not strong enough on the wings, but besides that I think I can finally say I\'ve found an improvement I like. Great job Always."

It provides the security that some people need, but th drawback is that it does not have wings, so making the pads less secure sometimes.

I suffer from a light flow that races headlong into areas far beyond the protection of a regular overnight pad regardless of whether it is night or day or at home, work or out in public. After quite a long time of dealing with that \'uh-oh\' feeling (you know what I\'m talking about) several times during the day and night and racing for the restroom to try to avoid a mess, I found these. Yes, they are just a bit bulky and uncomfortable, and yes, they feel a little like a diaper.  But the peace of mind they offer is SO absolutely worth it. And to be able to buy them reasonably priced and delivered to my home in a brown box instead of having them riding around Wal-mart in my grocery cart is an added bonus."

Sometimes the scented pads can be full of irritating perfumes, but this is not bad.  Thus the definition of \'lightly scented.\'  I don\'t want to feel like someone dumped a whole bottle of perfume on me when I open the package.  Especially since I have allergies. Practical product that does the job."

The wings keep from accidents and the cover keeps you dry feeling. The overnights are fantastic. They are extra long, very thin, and really keep from stains at night. Also for heavy days, they are extra protection what you can\'t feel at all. These usually cost a little bit more that the average pad but highly worth the peace of mind and less laundry."

I was unpleasantly surprised to receive these as a renewal to SUBSCRIBE & SAVE but as a TOTALLY DIFFERENT & INFERIOR PRODUCT!I used to love all P&G feminine pads & liners particularly from the fit & the dryweave fabric.  However, their newest version of this standard product is now smaller (they make you buy the X-tra longs to equate the previous dimensions of the longs).  They should remark the packages to be small, medium, and long version.  In addition, the pads themselves are super flimsy to the point where they instantly bunch and become uncomfortable.  The flimsiness makes it so the adhesive doesn\'t stand a chance at your backside.  Worthless!RESEARCHERS, PRODUCT DEVELOPERS, AND MARKETERS AT P&G:  Go back to your former SUPERIOR product line!  Maybe you should restudy the fit of these on real women.  When you are already thin, thinner doesn\'t always equate to better.....JUST CHEAPER FEELING."

I did not expect them to work so darn well! My husband was so scared that it wouldnt work and that I would be upset with him for buying the wrong ones, but I am now soooo glad he did. I will never use anyother ones besides these Infinity.Mainly because they are so soft. It feels like those packing styrophome thin sheets that they wrap around the TV screen when you first open the box. That type of smooth and cushiny type feel, just thicker than this sheet. And when I finally ran out, I had to borrow my moms other thins pads (not the infinity) and I only used it for two days and it irritated me again. So if you have that problem, get these.

Although I\'m a loyal Always user, I had never tried their Infinity line of pads - honestly, I didn\'t know if they were that much better than their regular line to spend the extra bucks.Right away, I was shocked when opening the wrapper to see that the pad appears full of holes (over-my-head engineering towards absorbency, I suppose -- or perhaps aerodynamics? Ha!). Anyway, there IS a liner underneath, but it still looks a bit frightening. I bravely wore one, and yes, the absorbency and dryness was slightly better than the current Always products I use. The holes did their job.However, my favorite part of the Infinity pad is the wing design! I never would have thought much about it (wings are wings, I thought), but the Infinity pad has a scalloped \'B\' edge to its wing. I had more successful \'sticking\' of the Infinity\'s wing than I\'ve ever had with a normal curved \'D\' edged wing. Usually the wings (though very important and necessary to me in a pad), cause the most stress and hassle when applying! Part of it sticks, part of it doesn\'t and curls upward, leaving sticky spots exposed. Not comfortable. So, the \'B\' shaped edge of the Infinity pad was a plus!Overall, I would definitely use the Infinity pads again, but probably only if I had a coupon to defray the extra cost. Either way, I trust Always\' products for confident protection!"

There are other pads on the market that absorb as well and as much without the bulk of these.  When I opened the box I was actually surprised at how big the package was for 20 pads, but that is due to how thick they are.

I was at Target a few weeks ago looking for pads when I noticed that Always Infinity was on sale. Ever since they debuted I had basically avoided them like the plague because they\'re more expensive than Always Ultrathins with wings and I had a sneaking suspicion that the product was more hype than substance. But another customer saw me mulling the purchase over and insisted that I buy it. \'Oh, it holds a lot!\' she gushed (no pun intended). \'Trust me!\'Okay, so I did. I bought a box of \'heavy flow\' Infinity plus another box of Ultrathins for \'back up.\' And thank God I did! These pads have got to be the weirdest and most ineffectual maxis I have ever tried. When I first opened one up, I was horrified. First of all, the \'pad\' isn\'t at all like the cotton pad you would expect from a feminine napkin. The material is some kind of \'compressed material\', very similar in feel, flatness and texture to one of those oldskool white spongy Doctor Scholl\'s inserts. It even had the same type of holes in it (at the front of the pad). Making matters worse, there were some goofy markings in the back of the pad, making it look more like some futuristic landing strip at a spaceport than a maxi pad.And the entire thing was tiny. It was so small I had to double check to make sure which size pad I had gotten. But nope, this was indeed the heavy flow pad I was trying out.At any rate, I tried it out and holy frijoles, the adhesive was so weak, the wings couldn\'t attach properly. So I kept pressing them again and they flopped back out like they went, \'OH, NO SHE DIDN\'T! SHE DID NOT TRY STICKING US TO HER UNDERWEAR!\' By this point, my patience was wearing thin, but I had a box of these and was determined to try them out. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Within an hour I could see that flow was leaking/ rolling past the perimeters of the pad. I decided not to chance the pads as my period went into its heavy flow stage and went with my regular Ultrathin Overnights. Then when my flow went light again, I tried the Infinity again for one night. Woke up the next morning and saw that after pooling in the middle, the very little flow I\'d had hopped, skipped, and rolled past the futuristic spaceport landing strip markings in the back of the pad and then found its \'happy place\' in the back of my underwear. Nice.Needless to say, I wasn\'t happy with these  and will still keep using Ultrathins. There\'s one plus side-- if I experience shoe pain in the future and there are no Dr. Scholl\'s inserts to be had, I can use these instead."

My son has a severe peanut allergy, and apparently with allergies comes eczema (skin condition that causes open sores).  We\'ve used steroids with limited results, and we don\'t like using it very much nor does my son as it\'s a pretty strong medicine.For some reason, my memory was triggered and I remembered my Japanese mother growing aloe plants and using them on us when we had an injury or received a burn (happens when you grow up on a farm).  I wasn\'t thinking of prevention, but healing his open sores that were getting pretty bad--on his arms, behind his legs, on his feet, and on his inner thighs.  (He is entering his teenage years, and is obviously very sensitive about his skin.  The kids at school always ask why he wears long pants, and not shorts like they do in school and after school).Long story short, I came across \'George\'s Aloe\' and thought what the heck, can\'t hurt.  It\'s a natural product and worth a try.  I also read that Aloe is a natural antihistimine.  We\'ve been using it for a week on our son, and the results are very positive.  It hasn\'t prevented the outbreaks, but it has diminished them noticeably.  I would say upwards of 80% improvement.  The spring is the worst time for my son, and it\'s been very manageable.  My wife and I have noticed a significant improvement in his condition and he drinks a small glass of George\'s Aloe every morning.  I tried it, and it indeed does take like water.  Read the directions, though, as you don\'t need much.I\'ve since supplemented the \'internal\' treatment with an external treatment of the actual aloe plant rubbed on the outside of his body (arms, legs, feet, etc.).  You basically just cut off a very small part of the leaf, and it\'s a gel inside.  I rub that on his sores, pimples, and hives and paired with the Aloe juice, has had a dramatic effect, a definite improvement for the better.  My son is much more relaxed of late, and very happy with the results.  It\'s not perfect by any means, but he itches a LOT less and he doesn\'t have the open weeping sores that he had before.  Again, it\'s not perfect, but a huge improvement.I think for others in the same situation, it\'s worth a try.  I would just make sure there isn\'t some sort of allergy to it--but I\'ve never heard of an allergic reaction to Aloe.Finally, my wife has tried a lot of remedies on my son: lotions, aforementioned steroids, hot showers followed by vaseline to keep the moisture in, etc., and none of them has had the same noticeable positive effect as Warren Laboratories \'George\'s Aloe\'.A very enthusiastic and strong 5 Stars for this product.I hope you find a use for it, too."

It\'s the only pad that really works!!! It\'s amazing. Some reviewer complained that it\'s like a diaper, I guess she does not have heavy period like me.

That aside the problem with this pad is that while designedfor heavy flow, it actually is not a good pad to depend upon when you have heavy flow. The fatal flaw is that all liquid hits the pad at a specific spot, but goes under what you can visibly see. So in other words, when you check the panit may seem as though there is only a little bit of fluid. However, once you remove the pad you seethat all of the fluid is kept away from sight under the initial layer of cotton. The reason this isproblematic is that it interfere with your ability to correctly judge when the pad is actually FULL.And if you misjudge that, the pad will overflow!Typically all other pads you can visible see how much fluid is on it  and can easily determine when itneeds to be changed. But with infinity, while it may hold a lot, it\'s to scary to trust. To get an accurate understanding of how full the pad actually is, you need to look at the back. I think thispad is best used for average flow. and heavy flow should be left to any other pads in their line thatdon\'t use this \'hide the fluid\' technology."

Less-prepared co-workers will beg, borrow and (usually) steal them once they discover how well they work.  This brings up the cost per use (for you) up by a whole lot.

Always Infinity is designed to draw moisture to the bottom of the pad, leaving the top virtually dry! It\'s amazing. It can be a bit misleading as the top looks dry and the bottom will be completely soaked however once you\'re aware of your flow it\'s not difficult to know when you\'re due for a change.

I was staying at my sister\'s for a few days when I got my period unexpectedly, and she doesn\'t use these. So, when I had to use her regular pads, I was in hell for a day and half until I could go buy some of the Infinity pads. But, lesson learned. I stash one or two in every place I can in case of emergencies (ex: travel bags, different purses, cosmetics bag, you name it) so I never have to stress out again. It is just so comfortable, I sometimes forget that I\'m on my period and wearing a pad (leading to a danger of remembering to change). If women out there have not used these yet, I cannot urge you enough to switch to the Always Infinity. It honestly is a miracle for women using pads.

No it\'s not thin.  It isn\'t supposed to be.The pad is a GREAT 15\' LONG.  Offering more protection where the flow goes which is toward our buttocks than any other on the market.  I for one am tired of connecting two pads to get any semblance of protection.  Even light flow doesn\'t go straight down, not if you have thighs which meet.  Some of you are complaining that its too big, well there are plenty more petite pads on the market if you indeed need a smaller pad but for those with a heavy flow and for women above a size 14 who have a big booty we need to APPLAUD THIS PAD for finally arriving for us.  I don\'t know why the industry didn\'t realize a century ago that you shouldn\'t be trying to make pads the same dimension when women range from 4\'9\' to 6\'7\'.  A 6-7\' long pad doesn\'t even protect the most direct fluid route if you\'re a larger lady. Lying down, flow goes awry even more so and for a pad to actually deserve the title OVERNIGHT it needs to come with a nice old old fashioned belting system (just a little strip folks) and truly be more like 22\' inches long.  We need a pad to reach from tummy to back of your waist if it is to prevent all staining and allow us to go to sleep without worry.  These pads don\'t do that and I wish they did.I still say manufacturers have no idea what a heavy flow is but I\'m afraid these are as good as its gets when it come to holding a lot blood. Good for postpartum.  If you have adenomyosis, fibroids, endometriosis, are in peri-menopause or GOD FORBID ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS, I\'m afraid even this pad will need frequent changing.  Do Diapers work as an alternative?  The answer is \'not so well\' as they are made of textiles meant to absorb a dilute fluid not a thick fluid.  Until Proctor and Gamble gets it right the natural green brand of diapers- TUSHIES in its largest size helps some with overnight woes.  If you are a tiny woman you might even be able to actually get one on completely, unwieldy to use (nothing to hold them on).  Alas they are kind to sensitive skin.Back to these pads...For comfort no one ever beats ALWAYS.  They have made the best \'tops\', the surface that touches your skin, for over 2 decades.  In other words they feel great and do stay dry.  These don\'t have the texture of their new Infinity line but instead have that sort of plastic lace top Always came out with back in the late 70s early 80s. I wish that they applied the Infinity odor control and material to THIS SIZE.  Layer the INFINITY textile over this pad.  That combination of materials I think would be a SMASH HIT!  Listen to MEEEE P&G.A word about those darned wings.  All they do is channel moisture toward your groin and hold it there against your skin to make you chafe.  They never stay in place.  They don\'t spare your pretty panties anything.  Take them away!  I tuck them under [or scissor them off].This pad has an adhesive strip protector sheet on top, and another on its back. I welcome that.  When was the last time you saw a women wash her hands BEFORE entering a stall?  You\'re handling a pad with your paws covered with every bacteria from elevator buttons, escalator rails, filthy knobs, currency, tickets, and other person\'s hands and then putting all those bad particles there.  That TOP protective sheet lets you get the pad on without transferring all that mayhem to your groin. That area needs to be handled as sterile-y (is that a word?) as you handle your eyes but no one seems to ever say that.  I wish pads were marked STERILE and were indeed that pristine.INCONTINENCE, these are useless for that purpose.  Add Always Max Protection Dri Liners.  They are as thin as a sheet of paper.  And as teeny as they are (really short) they do hold liquid and boost the performance of any pad they are added to.  Their adhesive is strong, stronger even than on these full size pads. They do not come with any kind of wrapper.I\'m switching back to Always from Natracare.  Went there to avoid chemicals and because there was a sort of quiet underground buzz abut Always is just not being sterile enough in their manufacturing and indeed causing infections but with heavy use Natracare\'s SUPER is irritating and their Nighttime Extra Long is woefully not up to par but if you want less of a pad than these they just might be right for you.  I\'m hoping P&G is making these in at least a CLEAN environment despite the fact that you never see the term STERILE in a sanitary product description.  I think it ought to be there especially for tampons.I DO RECOMMEND THESE FOR HEAVIER FLOW DAYS but unless your body is neater than mine you\'ll still stain sheets until manufacturers really bring the pad to waist.  That\'s just the simple unattractive truth of the matter.Finally the pads are WHITE, my flash may be making them look pink or purple.SOAP dot com with their great 15-20% off coupons and Amazon are running neck and neck on price.For Natracare the best price I\'ve found is at Lucky Vitamin  The Nighttime Extra Long was $3.45 for 10."

I\'ve been using Always pads for years now because I found them to be the most comfortable and effective option on the market, but even their overnight pads couldn\'t keep up with my body on heavy days, not to mention the crime scene-style sheet stains that would greet me in the morning if I rolled onto my back while sleeping.  With these, though, I can sleep without fear!  The pad is very long and provides great coverage for the back of the underpants, where blood tends to flow, especially while lying on one\'s back.  If you\'re used to tampons or super-thin pads, I\'m sure one of these will feel like a diaper, but as someone used to needing to wear overnight pads, I find them quite comfortable and not at all bothersome.

But I dreamed of something softer, something that wasn\'t rubbing against me and causing me irritation.  Finally, Always Infinity came along, and I\'ve been thrilled!Infinity Heavy Flow is perfect for  when I\'m having a heavy flow or need prolonged protection at night, when I need my pad to provide me with plenty of absorption.  The wings keep the pad secure, they actually wrap around and stick to my panty and the softness keeps me comfortable.  I like not thinking about my pad.  I also like that the pad is designed to be wider in the back.  I\'ve had experiences where my flow completely missed the pad, due to it being too short.  Length is very important if you\'re sitting or laying down for long periods of time.  Also, this is a good pad if you\'re a plus-sized lady.  What length size you choose also depends on your weight too, not just your flow.Out of the various pads that I\'ve purchased, I find that the Infinity series is a bit more expensive, but it is worth the extra change for the comfort and security.  Always Infinity Regular was my go to pad, but now, since trying out the Infinity Heavy Flow, I think I\'ll start using these for nighttime. A big plus, is that this brand comes in unscented, yea!  I don\'t have to worry about irritation due to deodorants that don\'t mask anything.  If you haven\'t tried this brand, do so, you will notice the comfort, immediately."

The pad LEAKS, LEAKS, runs off the top and bottom (but doesn\'t seem to leak through the pad).  I believe there was another reviewer who writes about a water test, where a significant amount of the fluid ran off rather than absorbing into the pad.  Infinity is definitely not comparable in protection to the Always Wings Super or Overnight variety, which NEVER leaks from any angle.  Second, Infinity feels \'wet\' against the skin, which is absolutely unacceptable when wearing for several hours.  Third, for the cost - get the superior absorbancy pad, the standard wings-style Always super or overnight protection.  I guess if you have very light periods, then the Infinity will work for you.

I\'ve always had a problem with being, shall we say... extra juicy. :) So, pantyliners are a staple item at my house. When it came down to choosing between Always & Carefree, a quick whiff of the package determined the clear winner. Carefree possessed an awful, overpowering floral scent that made me want to gag. It was the same stench that I had detected in many public restrooms, combined with *other* odors I dare not mention. OTOH, Always had a fresh, light, clean scent that was not the least bit cloying. Always is like a gentle breeze, whereas Carefree is comparable to a full-blown F5 tornado... with the lifeless carcasses of a few livestock caught up in the funnel. Always is simply the best choice for any woman/girl who seeks good absorption combined with a *slight* fragrance. The problem with highly-scented pantyliners is that, when combined with bodily fluids, they emit some extremely revolting fumes (exactly what I smelt in the public restrooms). Besides, who wants a pantyliner that will undermine your perfume? Who wants to hear \'Hey, what\'s that smell coming from your crotch\'? This will never be a problem with Always. But, scent factor aside, I also love these because they are thin, stay in place reasonably well (with the exception of profuse sweating), absorb a moderate amount of moisture... and I really dig the light blue wrappers (I hate pink; another reason why I\'m put-off by Carefree). :PConclusion: These pantyliners rule. Stock up before I buy them all."

When I first opened it, I was confused. I\'d never seen anything like it. It was so strangely light and yet didn\'t seem like it should be. The material made me think of memory foam, only super soft textured.With how thin it was at the top, I didn\'t think it would be impressive for my flow (I have endometriosis, so that means I always have to wear overnight or better, maximum protection pads to keep up with my super flow, sometimes in addition to a tampon, which I hate wearing). Well, it worked great and it really felt like I didn\'t have anything on.I decided to actually buy the product this period to see if it was just a fluke and put it to the test immediately with my worst time--overnight on my heaviest night. When even the best pads have failed me in the past.Not a drop off the pad. The wings held and only in one place did it even leave the center of the top (the entire bottom was filled). And I felt DRY. If I hadn\'t seen the bottom, I\'d have thought maybe there was no flow overnight.I tried another today and got that familiar \'overproducing\' feeling that always leads to pad failure. I went to the bathroom, expecting a mess and the pad had contained it completely. It hadn\'t approached any edges. I was shocked and amazed. I\'ve never had a pad work this well, in 15 years of super-heavy periods, that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage.What\'s more, I almost always get irritation on this day in my cycle. Nada. I am SOLD.So, to recap: it held more than any other pad I\'ve seen that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage. It left NO irritation on a heavy day. It worked overnight on my worst night.

I too have fibroids and a major bleeding problem - clots, which are very hard to absorb.  I have to sleep with a towel under me and try to discreetly sit on a folder at work if I go to a meeting, it\'s so embarrassing.  Also with the fibroids and polycystic ovaries I have a questionable cycle and will skip months then bleed for weeks at a time (yes I know I need to just have the surgery lol).  I needed the pads stat so I bought them locally and woke up several times with no leaks for the first time in 10 or so years. I feel like today I can run errands without worrying about my tan leather interior, restaraunt chairs or spotting.  This is major, especially for a person who has had a month long period.  The amazon pricing with super saver shipping offers is a much better deal than my local store so I will be back here to buy in bulk.  I also bought the Always overnight super sonic maxi based on reviews and will try that out and leave a review.Thank you Always, thank you Amazon, and thank you reviewers!**UPDATE**  Back on here to buy more of this product, at a better price than my local store.  Still love them and have referred several friends who were also heavy period sufferers.  We all love them.  Also, try the overnight extra heavy flow with wings!  This pad must be at least 14\' long, great for my needs and especially plus size women.  The overnight feels a tad diaper-ish to wear by day, but still works if you need it.  The fit is great on both, I don\'t experience as much bunching and they stay in place. So glad to have my stress level reduced related to spotting and I don\'t have to wear black clothes every day!"

So every month for 5 days since I was ten, I\'ve had to suffer with basically a plastic diaper in my pants. The itchiness, the unbreathable plastic, the bulk. So a few months ago I got a sample of these in my regular box of pads, and all I can say is that I\'m hooked! No more plastic sticking to your butt. No more wet diaper feeling. No more bunching up in your underwear. No more wishing I was a bigger girl so that I could enjoy the freedom of tampons. The only thing that would make them better for me is if the had a wingless version, (I\'ve never really needed wings on my pads,) and a smaller, light flow day version. They are slightly longer (and wider in the rear) than the average pad but for me that is an improvement as I have felt that many pads available were too short, meaning I had to be careful how I sat/reclined when using one. Girls with heavy flows may still find these inadequate but as a moderate flow girl I find these to be better than the regular maxi pad. Did I mention They\'re so much more comfortable?

You could use this product for hours, and it seemed to keep me more fresh than others. The shape confirms better to your undergarments,than the other pads, in my opinion.

I guess that just depends on the type of flow you have, because they do seem to absorb well for me and other people.  However, I can see why they wouldn\'t be very absorbant for some people, because it seems to take a tad longer to absorb than other pads.  So I guess it just depends on the person\'s flow.For me, it\'s no better or worse than any other pad that I\'ve worn, absorbant-wise.  It\'s just more expensive.  I do, however, HATE ultra-thin pads because I think they feel like wearing paper.  But these don\'t feel like that.The thing that leaves me scratching my head is the almost-triangular SHAPE of the pad.

They worked very well, but the wings could be a bugger to get set right sometimes especially if the folded or something while you put them on.As an alternative, I do recommend cloth pads (there are some really great ones available out there.) They wash up really easy in my experience and you don\'t have to worry about chemicals. I also end up having less leaks, less itchiness etc when using cloth pads.Another alternative that I highly recommend is a menstrual cup. I have a seriously heavy flow and menstrual cups work wonderfully. (I\'m talking about the silicone kind that you wash and reuse)They hold about twice as much flow as a tampon and I wear cloth pads or liners for back up. I can wear a menstrual cup comfortably but I\'m unable to wear tampons. Most tampons are also full of icky chemicals.Natracare is a good brand of disposable menstrual protection that doesn\'t have all the icky chemicals if you just can\'t bring yourself to try the other things or if you need something disposable sometimes."

I tried these and found that for my needs they actually make much better pantyliners than pads.

It always ended up turning toward my body, which meant that there was some pulling in areas I\'d rather not be pulled. I tried the pads a few different times, but was never sold.

These wells increase the total surface area that liquid is in contact with the absorbent material and so the liquid not only passes through the surface layer faster, but it also gets absorbed faster by the inner material.Overall, this product does exactly what it claims to do.  Highly recommended for those prone to sudden heavy flow and those with minor incontinence. Pricey but worth it."

So please do NOT think this is only targeted toward girls with extra heavy flow.  If you\'re like me and always get so paranoid about leakage at night that you end up lying stiff straight on your bed and always sleep badly during your period, then THIS IS FOR YOU.I stumbled across this one by accident, as not all stores carry this particular size (at least not a couple of years ago).  Ever since then there is not a single day in my house that I don\'t have a pack of this stored in my cabinet, it\'s THAT essential.As I said before, I tend to sleep really badly during my period because i\'m so paranoid of moving at night and allowing leakage onto my sheets (which are a pain to wash out!)  Let\'s just say my crankiness during that time isn\'t all attributed to hormones!  After I started using this one though, aside from the usual cramps and back soreness, nothing else would affect my sleep.This pad is almost like twice the size of a normal day-time heavy pad, or 1.5x size of the old overnight pad I used to use.  The best thing about this, is that not only is it super long so that it covers all the way up to the top of your butt crack, it also has extra wing in that back area that spreads out and allows for more protection.  If you ever had issues where the old overnight is long enough, but liquid would leak on the side when you sleep on your side, then this will get rid of that problem.It is a huge pad though (my friend, who never used it before, when she saw me buying it she thought it was as big as a diaper x___x ) but I wouldn\'t want any thinner pad (even in the same shape and size) if only because the thinner it is, the less i feel protected.  And no matter what, I always want to be protected from leakage, not to mention being able to sleep better!also i only use this for the first 2-4 days or until the flow gets slow so that leakage won\'t really happen any more.  during the day or during the trailing part of my period, i switch back to regular sized pads."

My husband and I are trying it out for his eczema. And I heard it can work to help coprophagic dogs, so we are giving some to our dog. This is the best aloe vera drink available. It is expensive, but worth it!"

He did not say any changes after taking it.How ever we are happy that it does work on younger kid, which is our main concern.We did recommend same product for my friends family who have less than 6 years old kids.I still need to use it, I will update my review if it does have any benefits on adults."
