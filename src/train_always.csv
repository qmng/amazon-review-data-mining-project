123,123,20111106,B0029NYQ2E,1,"November 6, 2011",A3P3J6QFE7K230,What the heck is this?!,"Pinch me-- I must be dreaming! No, seriously! I was at Target a few weeks ago looking for pads when I noticed that Always Infinity was on sale. Ever since they debuted I had basically avoided them like the plague because they\'re more expensive than Always Ultrathins with wings and I had a sneaking suspicion that the product was more hype than substance. But another customer saw me mulling the purchase over and insisted that I buy it. \'Oh, it holds a lot!\' she gushed (no pun intended). \'Trust me!\'Okay, so I did. I bought a box of \'heavy flow\' Infinity plus another box of Ultrathins for \'back up.\' And thank God I did! These pads have got to be the weirdest and most ineffectual maxis I have ever tried. When I first opened one up, I was horrified. First of all, the \'pad\' isn\'t at all like the cotton pad you would expect from a feminine napkin. The material is some kind of \'compressed material\', very similar in feel, flatness and texture to one of those oldskool white spongy Doctor Scholl\'s inserts. It even had the same type of holes in it (at the front of the pad). Making matters worse, there were some goofy markings in the back of the pad, making it look more like some futuristic landing strip at a spaceport than a maxi pad.And the entire thing was tiny. It was so small I had to double check to make sure which size pad I had gotten. But nope, this was indeed the heavy flow pad I was trying out.At any rate, I tried it out and holy frijoles, the adhesive was so weak, the wings couldn\'t attach properly. So I kept pressing them again and they flopped back out like they went, \'OH, NO SHE DIDN\'T! SHE DID NOT TRY STICKING US TO HER UNDERWEAR!\' By this point, my patience was wearing thin, but I had a box of these and was determined to try them out. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Within an hour I could see that flow was leaking/ rolling past the perimeters of the pad. I decided not to chance the pads as my period went into its heavy flow stage and went with my regular Ultrathin Overnights. Then when my flow went light again, I tried the Infinity again for one night. Woke up the next morning and saw that after pooling in the middle, the very little flow I\'d had hopped, skipped, and rolled past the futuristic spaceport landing strip markings in the back of the pad and then found its \'happy place\' in the back of my underwear. Nice.Needless to say, I wasn\'t happy with these  and will still keep using Ultrathins. There\'s one plus side-- if I experience shoe pain in the future and there are no Dr. Scholl\'s inserts to be had, I can use these instead."

What a difference!  The pad is thin, yet very absorbent.  The wings are perfect, and the material is the softest that I have ever come in contact with. I have many skin allergies, but this product doesn\'t cause a reaction.  I\'m hooked!"

They are not soft like most pantiliners I\'ve used, but are very stiff.  They are extremely wide.  So wide, in fact, they  tend to curl under along the edges as they are worn.  I ordered through the subscribe and save program. Should have tried them first.  I will definitely be canceling that subscription."

My wife bought this for me to see if it would help one or both problems.  I was only able to take it for ten days, at 4 oz, twice a day before I started to have a generalized itchy rash on my arms and legs.  I stopped on day 11 when I figured it out: i am probably allergic to aloe.  Sure enough, the rash went away.  Maybe if I had more time, it could have helped me, but there was no noticeable difference in any of my digestive problems for those 10 days.  Tasted like water, so pleasant enough, but it just didn\'t do what I hoped."

Yes, in all those descriptors, I somehow missed a key word...The female of the species reports that these are good overall: very absorbent, appropriately adhesive, lightly scented and successfully deodorizing - but too long for her, for whom they bunched up."
132,132,20110721,B0029NYQ2E,1,"July 21, 2011",A396XW4T0FKPM6,"AWUFUL - leaks, wet, yuk!","This product deserves no stars.  First of all, I have been a long-time Always pad user, and very happy the wing products.  Thought I would try the Infinity model, to see what the hype was about.  BIG MISTAKE!  The pad LEAKS, LEAKS, runs off the top and bottom (but doesn\'t seem to leak through the pad).  I believe there was another reviewer who writes about a water test, where a significant amount of the fluid ran off rather than absorbing into the pad.  Infinity is definitely not comparable in protection to the Always Wings Super or Overnight variety, which NEVER leaks from any angle.  Second, Infinity feels \'wet\' against the skin, which is absolutely unacceptable when wearing for several hours.  Third, for the cost - get the superior absorbancy pad, the standard wings-style Always super or overnight protection.  I guess if you have very light periods, then the Infinity will work for you.  Anything other than very light - I\'d recommend the Always Wings varieties."

They\'re very long, so they prevent leaks quite well. They\'re great for overnight or for the daytime. They\'re very thin, so it doesn\'t feel like you\'re wearing a diaper all day. And they are very absorbent, and they do wick moisture away from your body very quickly. I don\'t have to worry with these. This is a great product at a great price, and with the subscribe and save, it\'s an ever better deal. And it\'s not like you won\'t go through them."

There is only strip of paper over the wings to deal with and you don\'t have to worry about pulling it off until the pad is already secure. I do prefer the scented pads, but these are quite absorbent without feeling heavy, so it\'s an easy trade-off.  These are by far the most thoughtfully packaged pads as well.  You simply open at the tab and pull off the pad.  Genius.I think the equivalent Stayfree pads feel fresh longer and last a little longer, but these pads feel thinner."

I\'m 5\'3\' and 120lbs.  These are longer than all the others (even the other Always overnights in the green and orange package) and are more flared towards the back to provide better coverage.  Perfect for getting a full night\'s sleep without having to worry about waking up and changing.  They are thicker so some people may not like that, but it works for me."

One thing she hates is wings and this one is wing-free. That\'s a huge plus right off the bat! When she used them, she appreciated the way they locked away the fluid in the pad. But as someone who is a \'heavy\' flower, she said this may not be for you as an overnight pad. They need to be longer to accommodate overnight flow. Overall, not too bad."

Problems I\'ve had with other pads: too long, too short, too thick, not wide enough. These seem to be the right length, thickness, and absorbency. I like that you can buy more than one at a time through Amazon, as it is convenient to just have them shipped as you need them."

I\'m not normally a pad fan, but the extra coverage made sure that I wasn\'t having to scrub panties by hand. I am due to deliver my 2nd in the next month, and trust me these will be the only pad I bother with. I cannot count how many I pitched in the trash before we found these."
209,209,20110624,B0029NYQB0,5,"June 24, 2011",A2VDQUOEN5SYKD,The only pantyliner good enough for my muff,"Hi there! I\'ve always had a problem with being, shall we say... extra juicy. :) So, pantyliners are a staple item at my house. When it came down to choosing between Always & Carefree, a quick whiff of the package determined the clear winner. Carefree possessed an awful, overpowering floral scent that made me want to gag. It was the same stench that I had detected in many public restrooms, combined with *other* odors I dare not mention. OTOH, Always had a fresh, light, clean scent that was not the least bit cloying. Always is like a gentle breeze, whereas Carefree is comparable to a full-blown F5 tornado... with the lifeless carcasses of a few livestock caught up in the funnel. Always is simply the best choice for any woman/girl who seeks good absorption combined with a *slight* fragrance. The problem with highly-scented pantyliners is that, when combined with bodily fluids, they emit some extremely revolting fumes (exactly what I smelt in the public restrooms). Besides, who wants a pantyliner that will undermine your perfume? Who wants to hear \'Hey, what\'s that smell coming from your crotch\'? This will never be a problem with Always. But, scent factor aside, I also love these because they are thin, stay in place reasonably well (with the exception of profuse sweating), absorb a moderate amount of moisture... and I really dig the light blue wrappers (I hate pink; another reason why I\'m put-off by Carefree). :PConclusion: These pantyliners rule. Stock up before I buy them all."

The directions of Front was a nice feature. The fact that they have wrap on the pads helps that you can store them in your purse or desk.

I was a little afraid that the \'odor lock\' stuff would be irritating or obtrusive but I did not find it to be such at all. I found these to be a good length and thickness and not prone to leaks. And with the Subscribe and Save option it\'s a good buy considering it\'s a brand name product. I will purchase these again."

They aggravated all my symptoms and made them worse.  I was in a supplement store and the clerk recommended aloe vera to which I said \'No way, I tried it already\'.  He said \'Oh, you tried the other stuff.  Let me introduce you to George\'s\'.My life improved dramatically almost immediately.  All the symptoms disappeared or diminished.  I even tried going off the stuff after a week and the symptoms returned.  Since then I keep a couple of gallons around all the time.  If I forget to use it my body lets me know in 3 or 4 days and I go back on it.  I only have to drink 1 or 2 ounces a day.These people who are saying this is water or that it doesn\'t work are suspect as far as I am concerned.  Do they work for the competition?  Do they have a beef with George\'s?  Did they take it correctly?  What else are they taking or eating and drinking?  Do they think the FDA would let George\'s get away with selling water?  You know how much the FDA would love to put the supplement business out of business!  They have tried hard enough.I know it works and I have recommended it to many others who are happy drinkers of George\'s Aloe Vera juice now.  Too bad I can\'t give it 6 stars.

I bought these only because of the price, but have been pretty satisfied.Nope, they don\'t have wings, but I experienced very little pad migration or movement.  These have stayed fairly secure; exactly where I place them.These pads are also decent absorbers.  I absolutely hate the cheapies that leave you uncomfortable during heavy flow, after a short period of time.  I don\'t remember having issues with these.  Good absorbers are sometimes too darn bulky, but I don\'t remember wearing these with close fitting pants and freaking out.I can also say these work pretty well for younger girls with less placement experience, which I wondered about when purchasing wing-less pads.In summary, while I can\'t say that I paid real close attention to this pad\'s performance when using, I can say that I don\'t remember making a mental note not to buy these again, no matter what the price was.

I often get what the chinese call \'Liver Yang Rising\', which results in a lot of hot tempered conditions.  Aloe Vera is very Yin tonifying, and it\'s always brought me great balance.  I love it.I was in the Vitamin Store, and saw this George\'s aloe.  I always buy the Lily of the Desert stuff, but this caught my eye, and I bought it. The price was similar in comparison.  I thought, what the heck, I\'ll give it a try.I\'m about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, and I now realize that I notice NONE of the beneficial Yin tonifying effects that traditional Aloe Vera Juice gives you.  Pretty much none whatsoever.  This Aloe tastes like distilled water.  Has no taste whatsoever.  A good part of Aloe\'s medicine is in the bitter.  All medicines in nature have a bitter tasting element to them.  Bitter is healing.  When you remove the bitter, I\'m not so sure it\'s healing anymore.I was reading through the testiominals on here, and they all seem stomach related.  Perhaps it has a beneficial effect on stomach woes, but since I don\'t have any, it did nothing for me.  It had no effect on my Liver Yang Rising, and I feel like the cooling, Yin tonifying effects just aren\'t there with this aloe.Not a big deal, wasted some money, but I\'m going right back to Lily of the Desert."

The only thing I wish I could change about them are the wings. I much prefer a product without wings, but with the Infinity I\'ll accept them. Prior to finding Infinity I always bypassed winged pads. I highly recommend them even if they are a little pricier than other products. They are worth it."

It\'s the only pad I\'ll use now.  They work great!  They are more absorbent than previous, thicker pads, but I wouldn\'t use them on super heavy days, or overnight.  They absorb quickly and keep you feeling drier and the wings are wonderful for providing extra protection.  I just wish that pad makers would stop making the outside wrapper so bright in color.  It\'s hard to be discreet with a bright green wrapper announcing to the world that you have your period.JUST A NOTE: I didn\'t write this review - my wife did."

So, after much research, I kept coming back to Aloe Vera Juice. George\'s was recommended for it\'s taste and texture. I\'ve been using it for a month. It took about a good week or so to really kick in, but I haven\'t experienced any heartburn, reflux, etc. I wasn\'t expecting it to work as well as it does. I would recommend this to everyone with any type of digestive issues. It\'s not instantanious, but it is so worth it when it does work. I drink 2 oz in the morning and 2 oz at night. It has the exact same feel, taste and texture as water. I have a real issue with taste and texture and this didn\'t bother me at all!!!! I\'ll keep you posted if there are any changes, good or bad."

I was hoping that the technology had come a long way since my early teen years, and it indeed has. My first reaction was that the pad was a lot longer than similar products I\'ve used, but this turned out to be a good thing.  The pad was extremely comfortable to wear, not at all bulky, and the wings did not keep coming unstuck as with similar products.  Absorption was excellent.  I will definitely buy this product again in the future, as opposed to some cheap brand or whatever is on sale."

They worked very well, but the wings could be a bugger to get set right sometimes especially if the folded or something while you put them on.As an alternative, I do recommend cloth pads (there are some really great ones available out there.) They wash up really easy in my experience and you don\'t have to worry about chemicals. I also end up having less leaks, less itchiness etc when using cloth pads.Another alternative that I highly recommend is a menstrual cup. I have a seriously heavy flow and menstrual cups work wonderfully. (I\'m talking about the silicone kind that you wash and reuse)They hold about twice as much flow as a tampon and I wear cloth pads or liners for back up. I can wear a menstrual cup comfortably but I\'m unable to wear tampons. Most tampons are also full of icky chemicals.Natracare is a good brand of disposable menstrual protection that doesn\'t have all the icky chemicals if you just can\'t bring yourself to try the other things or if you need something disposable sometimes."

I love Always, and have always used this brand, but now I will never use anyother class from Always except the Infinity. These Always infinity does its job! I use to use the bulky kind the first few days, as I am extremely heavy, then the regular thin ones the last couple days, but they would irritate me so bad! I would literally have a \'diaper rash\' down there. But one day I sent my husband to the store to buy me some, and he brought me the Infinity. I was at first disappointed because they were so thin! I did not expect them to work so darn well! My husband was so scared that it wouldnt work and that I would be upset with him for buying the wrong ones, but I am now soooo glad he did. I will never use anyother ones besides these Infinity.Mainly because they are so soft. It feels like those packing styrophome thin sheets that they wrap around the TV screen when you first open the box. That type of smooth and cushiny type feel, just thicker than this sheet. And when I finally ran out, I had to borrow my moms other thins pads (not the infinity) and I only used it for two days and it irritated me again. So if you have that problem, get these.

I usually don\'t like improvements because to me that is usually code for taking away something good about the product in order to make a cheaper product to produce and cut back on the quality.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with how well the new technology worked to absorb away from your body. Even on my heaviest days I didn\'t have any leaks and I didn\'t feel bulky as I sometimes can feel. The new design has a wider back and channels that help with faster absorption. The only problem that I have with this product is that the adhesive is not strong enough on the wings, but besides that I think I can finally say I\'ve found an improvement I like. Great job Always."

I\'ve been using Always pads for years now because I found them to be the most comfortable and effective option on the market, but even their overnight pads couldn\'t keep up with my body on heavy days, not to mention the crime scene-style sheet stains that would greet me in the morning if I rolled onto my back while sleeping.  With these, though, I can sleep without fear!  The pad is very long and provides great coverage for the back of the underpants, where blood tends to flow, especially while lying on one\'s back.  If you\'re used to tampons or super-thin pads, I\'m sure one of these will feel like a diaper, but as someone used to needing to wear overnight pads, I find them quite comfortable and not at all bothersome.

The length is just right - as a smaller person, I find the length of some pads too great, so have to pick and choose carefully among brands to find one that fits.  Unscented is also important to me - I hate the perfume used in so many brands - usually it is way too strong and screams to everyone who comes within 10\' of you: \'Period!\'.

Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up.

Always Infinity is designed to draw moisture to the bottom of the pad, leaving the top virtually dry! It\'s amazing.

They are comparable to other wipes, but as others have noted on reviews, they are quite narrow.  This allows one to get one good front to back swipe if holding the wipe lengthwise over the hand. May need two depending on amount of cleaning desired. I bought these mainly to have a portable wipe for work, when forced to use public restrooms (never know if there will be TP once you get in the stall!), or any other time away from home. 4 stars only because I do not particularly care for the added fragrance, and would prefer an adult \'baby wipe\' that is more gentle for sensitive areas.

They are of the thin absorbent variety, which avoids the diaper feeling.  The adhesive sticks well, which is always important.  The new wing design is better shaped to fit the contours of panties than flat wings.  While there are special channels and different shaped openings in the top layer, I am not convinced that the actual effect is significantly different than with other thin absorbent pads. The shape is wider at the back which is good for overnight use.  And while not really significant, the packaging is prettier.

Heavy and extra heavy pads were never absorbent enough. The similar sized (i.e. extra thick) pads would not stay fitted properly and caused leaks. The thicker pads I tried also twisted around to adhesive side up which was both very uncomfortable and caused them to not absorb correctly, so was also messy. I am concerned about toxic shock syndrome so I do not use tampons. I tried every brand of \'overnight\' or \'extra heavy\' pads out there at the time and none of them were up to it. I found these about three years ago and have not tried another heavy flow overnight pad since.With these Always brand Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings I never have to use more than one at a time. I\'ve never had leaks when using these pads and I don\'t have problems with them twisting around to adhesive side up. If you have extremely heavy menstrual flow then you should try these pads.It is true that they are extremely long and very thick. The pad length is such that some cuts of underwear will be too small (or short) in the back if you place the pad correctly. This causes the pad to overhang or stick out of the back of the underwear. This is remedied easily, but can be inconvenient. If this is something that you cannot stand then you should not get these pads.Regarding price, currently Amazon is offering a two pack for about 12 dollars. I\'ve seen big differences in price depending on where you get them (between 12 -20 for one pack)this is the lowest price I have seen so far (about 6 dollars for one pack)."

I don\'d mind the bulkiness of it, nor do I mind the length of it.Side Bar: But one thing I do have to note is that my menstrual started getting lighter since being diagnosed with anemia and taking iron pills daily. A heavy period is not normal, so for those experiencing a heavy cycle, check with your doc.A lot of my symptoms (extreme cramping, heavy clotting, heavy flow, etc), besides PMS, have subsided since taking iron pills, working out and eating more healthy foods. I keep these pads on deck and only use these pads maybe once during my cycle on my most heavy day, which isn\'t nearly as heavy as it once was. So they have lasted me for quite a while.Sorry for the side bar, but I had to add that in there in case some of you have been wondering why you are having such heavy cycles.At any rate, this product works!

That aside the problem with this pad is that while designedfor heavy flow, it actually is not a good pad to depend upon when you have heavy flow. The fatal flaw is that all liquid hits the pad at a specific spot, but goes under what you can visibly see. So in other words, when you check the panit may seem as though there is only a little bit of fluid. However, once you remove the pad you seethat all of the fluid is kept away from sight under the initial layer of cotton. The reason this isproblematic is that it interfere with your ability to correctly judge when the pad is actually FULL.And if you misjudge that, the pad will overflow!Typically all other pads you can visible see how much fluid is on it  and can easily determine when itneeds to be changed. But with infinity, while it may hold a lot, it\'s to scary to trust. To get an accurate understanding of how full the pad actually is, you need to look at the back. I think thispad is best used for average flow. and heavy flow should be left to any other pads in their line thatdon\'t use this \'hide the fluid\' technology."

They are classified as super absorbency, and they fit the bill.  I would recommend using only when maximum protection is needed.  They work very well, but do present a little bulk.  However, you can feel confident while wearing that you are protected.  They don\'t have the side \'wings,\' which is a plus for me, as I don\'t like that in a pad.  Recommended for heavy coverage."

Last week, my neighbor had like gallons of that shuff coming out of her.  All the damn Maxi pads in the world wouldn\'t clean that mess up!  I tried to lure a deer into the house to lick it all up, since deer eat nasty stuff, but the deer couldn\'t even clean up all that menstral blood!  So I had to shoot the deer, which left even more blood, deer brain splatter, and mess all over the floor.  My neighbor lady went to the store to get more Maxi pads to clean it all up, but when she was gone, I decided it was best to just burn her house down.  But I didn\'t know that my pet squirrel (and best friend and lover) was in her house and it got burned up in the fire, so now I have to train a new squirrel to be my lover.Shame on you Maxi Pads!"

But with no wings, it\'s hard to feel confident in this product for heavy-flow days. And it\'s so bulky that at first I thought I\'d been sent some bladder-control pads by mistake.

I tried these and found that for my needs they actually make much better pantyliners than pads.

These came as a sample in one of those packages. What an excellent marketing ploy. I did not think they could improve Always Ultrathins but they have.COMFORTAlways Infinity are oh so soft, thin and dry. Compared to Ultrathins, Inifinity feels more like tissue paper. They keep me drier than Ultrathins by somehow drawing the moisture away from me. With Ultrathins I feel dry. With these, I feel drier. I feel like I don\'t have any pads on.PROTECTIONI will not buy pads without wings. Always Infinity has double wings. Not sure if the double wings are actually better than single wings, but wings are wings and they do protect the sides of the panties just like the Ultrathin with Wings do.The back of the overnight Infinity is longer and wider than the front of the pad for that leakage that seeps backwards. So far, I have not had any accidents. The Infinity regular size, of course, doesn\'t have this added length in the back. I find the regular size adequate for daytime protection.Always Infinity are the most absorbant pads I\'ve ever used. Don\'t know what technology they have, but he moisture is pulled away from me and locked inside. When I change them, I feel they could still absorb so much more. With Ultrathins, I usually think they are at the end of their life.PROS:+wings+thin+keeps moisture away+most absorbant+soft and comfortable+overnights are longer and wider in backCONS:-NONE! Don\'t know how they\'ll improve these!SUMMARYAt the risk of sounding like I work for the company (I don\'t have any ties, trust me), try these. You\'ll be a convert.UPDATE:  Yes, I\'ve been using these ever since I\'ve been introduced to them.  The different lengths correspond exactly to what I need -- regular, heavy and overnight.  There\'s even a little note on each one telling me which side goes forward.  Still haven\'t found any cons."

They are so uncomfortable. Maybe it\'s cause I am only 5\'0\' and only 120 lbs. I guess you have to be a BIG, BIG woman to appreciate these pads!

I no longer have to worry about staying in one position all night and what not to avoid staining my clothes or bed.I\'m a medium pant size, so these Always pads cover back and front without problem and they\'re also wide enough in the center. But Always also came out with a Maxi pad for women size 14 and up which is a great idea too. Not all women have the same feminine needs so why do they have to stick to one-size-fits-all pad?

Generally, I go for pads that are long and have wings. These particular pads are not the kind I usually go for but I decided to give them a shot. I was actually pleasantly surprised with these!Let\'s talk about the positives first. I generally can\'t go through a period without ruining at least one pair of underwear. I can say that with these, I didn\'t soil my underwear at all. Not even one drop. Also, I\'ve found that pads that don\'t have wings tend to move around a bit but these stayed firmly in place.Now for a couple of negatives. First, as I said above, I like pads with wings. When I wear pads without wings, I\'m always afraid that the pad is going to shift and I\'m going to bleed right through my pants. Although I didn\'t have a problem with these pads, I wish they had wings just for the peace of mind. Second, I don\'t think the light scent did anything to control the odor.Overall, these work pretty well in absorbing and staying put.

This is more comfortable than the comparable maxis that also make sure you don\'t have accidents.- Odor control is good, barely discernable (if you don\'t notice any odor, it\'s all good!)- Wide, so even without wings you don\'t get accidents.I\'ve had no accidents with these, and they\'re even good when you come home from the hospital after having a baby and don\'t want to use the monster-sized pads they give you."

I usually always find them on sale and with a coupon and if I don\'t have either of those the regular price isn\'t bad either. I put a picture up for those who do not know what it looks like.

They don\'t fall apart or anything and don\'t have a weird scent. They are actually quite absorbent for pantiliners (more than most pantiliners I have used). This double pack lasts forever. Keep in mind that these are not individually wrapped. I didn\'t realize that when I purchsed them, but it\'s not a big deal because there is a lot less packaging this way.The only thing I would say I don\'t like is that they don\'t feel as soft and cottony as some other brands. Like all the other Always products, they have kind of a fake plastic feel to them. Since these are small though they don\'t bother me like their pads do."

188,188,20101125,B0029NYQ6A,4,"November 25, 2010",A2NETQRG6JHIG7,NO LONGER WILL YOU NEED TWO!,"Always Maxi Pads Overnight Extra Heavy Flow --Each pad comes individually wrapped in a very silky lavender plastic wrapper that can be used to dispose of the used pad.  No it\'s not thin.  It isn\'t supposed to be.The pad is a GREAT 15\' LONG.  Offering more protection where the flow goes which is toward our buttocks than any other on the market.  I for one am tired of connecting two pads to get any semblance of protection.  Even light flow doesn\'t go straight down, not if you have thighs which meet.  Some of you are complaining that its too big, well there are plenty more petite pads on the market if you indeed need a smaller pad but for those with a heavy flow and for women above a size 14 who have a big booty we need to APPLAUD THIS PAD for finally arriving for us.  I don\'t know why the industry didn\'t realize a century ago that you shouldn\'t be trying to make pads the same dimension when women range from 4\'9\' to 6\'7\'.  A 6-7\' long pad doesn\'t even protect the most direct fluid route if you\'re a larger lady. Lying down, flow goes awry even more so and for a pad to actually deserve the title OVERNIGHT it needs to come with a nice old old fashioned belting system (just a little strip folks) and truly be more like 22\' inches long.  We need a pad to reach from tummy to back of your waist if it is to prevent all staining and allow us to go to sleep without worry.  These pads don\'t do that and I wish they did.I still say manufacturers have no idea what a heavy flow is but I\'m afraid these are as good as its gets when it come to holding a lot blood. Good for postpartum.  If you have adenomyosis, fibroids, endometriosis, are in peri-menopause or GOD FORBID ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS, I\'m afraid even this pad will need frequent changing.  Do Diapers work as an alternative?  The answer is \'not so well\' as they are made of textiles meant to absorb a dilute fluid not a thick fluid.  Until Proctor and Gamble gets it right the natural green brand of diapers- TUSHIES in its largest size helps some with overnight woes.  If you are a tiny woman you might even be able to actually get one on completely, unwieldy to use (nothing to hold them on).  Alas they are kind to sensitive skin.Back to these pads...For comfort no one ever beats ALWAYS.  They have made the best \'tops\', the surface that touches your skin, for over 2 decades.  In other words they feel great and do stay dry.  These don\'t have the texture of their new Infinity line but instead have that sort of plastic lace top Always came out with back in the late 70s early 80s. I wish that they applied the Infinity odor control and material to THIS SIZE.  Layer the INFINITY textile over this pad.  That combination of materials I think would be a SMASH HIT!  Listen to MEEEE P&G.A word about those darned wings.  All they do is channel moisture toward your groin and hold it there against your skin to make you chafe.  They never stay in place.  They don\'t spare your pretty panties anything.  Take them away!  I tuck them under [or scissor them off].This pad has an adhesive strip protector sheet on top, and another on its back. I welcome that.  When was the last time you saw a women wash her hands BEFORE entering a stall?  You\'re handling a pad with your paws covered with every bacteria from elevator buttons, escalator rails, filthy knobs, currency, tickets, and other person\'s hands and then putting all those bad particles there.  That TOP protective sheet lets you get the pad on without transferring all that mayhem to your groin. That area needs to be handled as sterile-y (is that a word?) as you handle your eyes but no one seems to ever say that.  I wish pads were marked STERILE and were indeed that pristine.INCONTINENCE, these are useless for that purpose.  Add Always Max Protection Dri Liners.  They are as thin as a sheet of paper.  And as teeny as they are (really short) they do hold liquid and boost the performance of any pad they are added to.  Their adhesive is strong, stronger even than on these full size pads. They do not come with any kind of wrapper.I\'m switching back to Always from Natracare.  Went there to avoid chemicals and because there was a sort of quiet underground buzz abut Always is just not being sterile enough in their manufacturing and indeed causing infections but with heavy use Natracare\'s SUPER is irritating and their Nighttime Extra Long is woefully not up to par but if you want less of a pad than these they just might be right for you.  I\'m hoping P&G is making these in at least a CLEAN environment despite the fact that you never see the term STERILE in a sanitary product description.  I think it ought to be there especially for tampons.I DO RECOMMEND THESE FOR HEAVIER FLOW DAYS but unless your body is neater than mine you\'ll still stain sheets until manufacturers really bring the pad to waist.  That\'s just the simple unattractive truth of the matter.Finally the pads are WHITE, my flash may be making them look pink or purple.SOAP dot com with their great 15-20% off coupons and Amazon are running neck and neck on price.For Natracare the best price I\'ve found is at Lucky Vitamin  The Nighttime Extra Long was $3.45 for 10."

They stick well and handle wear and tear (like lots of walking) with no trouble. They\'re pretty thin and easy to carry around.I find this length to be best.

I too have fibroids and a major bleeding problem - clots, which are very hard to absorb.  I have to sleep with a towel under me and try to discreetly sit on a folder at work if I go to a meeting, it\'s so embarrassing.  Also with the fibroids and polycystic ovaries I have a questionable cycle and will skip months then bleed for weeks at a time (yes I know I need to just have the surgery lol).  I needed the pads stat so I bought them locally and woke up several times with no leaks for the first time in 10 or so years. I feel like today I can run errands without worrying about my tan leather interior, restaraunt chairs or spotting.  This is major, especially for a person who has had a month long period.  The amazon pricing with super saver shipping offers is a much better deal than my local store so I will be back here to buy in bulk.  I also bought the Always overnight super sonic maxi based on reviews and will try that out and leave a review.Thank you Always, thank you Amazon, and thank you reviewers!**UPDATE**  Back on here to buy more of this product, at a better price than my local store.  Still love them and have referred several friends who were also heavy period sufferers.  We all love them.  Also, try the overnight extra heavy flow with wings!  This pad must be at least 14\' long, great for my needs and especially plus size women.  The overnight feels a tad diaper-ish to wear by day, but still works if you need it.  The fit is great on both, I don\'t experience as much bunching and they stay in place. So glad to have my stress level reduced related to spotting and I don\'t have to wear black clothes every day!"

The flimsiness makes it so the adhesive doesn\'t stand a chance at your backside.  Worthless!RESEARCHERS, PRODUCT DEVELOPERS, AND MARKETERS AT P&G:  Go back to your former SUPERIOR product line!

They are super thin (like paper), the thinnest I have ever seen.  In my opinion, they are only for protecting you from a tampon leak (I\'m sorry for the visual, but it\'s true) or if you have regular discharge.

So please do NOT think this is only targeted toward girls with extra heavy flow.  If you\'re like me and always get so paranoid about leakage at night that you end up lying stiff straight on your bed and always sleep badly during your period, then THIS IS FOR YOU.I stumbled across this one by accident, as not all stores carry this particular size (at least not a couple of years ago).  Ever since then there is not a single day in my house that I don\'t have a pack of this stored in my cabinet, it\'s THAT essential.As I said before, I tend to sleep really badly during my period because i\'m so paranoid of moving at night and allowing leakage onto my sheets (which are a pain to wash out!)  Let\'s just say my crankiness during that time isn\'t all attributed to hormones!  After I started using this one though, aside from the usual cramps and back soreness, nothing else would affect my sleep.This pad is almost like twice the size of a normal day-time heavy pad, or 1.5x size of the old overnight pad I used to use.  The best thing about this, is that not only is it super long so that it covers all the way up to the top of your butt crack, it also has extra wing in that back area that spreads out and allows for more protection.  If you ever had issues where the old overnight is long enough, but liquid would leak on the side when you sleep on your side, then this will get rid of that problem.It is a huge pad though (my friend, who never used it before, when she saw me buying it she thought it was as big as a diaper x___x ) but I wouldn\'t want any thinner pad (even in the same shape and size) if only because the thinner it is, the less i feel protected.  And no matter what, I always want to be protected from leakage, not to mention being able to sleep better!also i only use this for the first 2-4 days or until the flow gets slow so that leakage won\'t really happen any more.  during the day or during the trailing part of my period, i switch back to regular sized pads."

Finally tired of wearing an overnight level absorbancy pad and a tampon just to be on the safe side, I decided to find another option. I saw a package of Always Overnight Extra Heavy Flow Maxi pads at my local Wal-Mart, and I thought it wouldn\'t hurt to try them out. W-o-w. First of all, this is a VERY long pad. It is about the length of two Always Ultra-Thin Overnight pads stuck together, and it pretty much expands from the top of my underwear to the back of them. Another helpful feature is that this pad contains two sets of wings--one in the middle like traditional pads and another set at the back. While, these pads DEFINITELY prevent leaks, I have a few complaints about this product. First of all, I\'ve noticed that when you remove the pad, it leaves a thin adhesive strip on your underwear that is hard to remove. So, though these pads keep you from having accidents, I still do not recommend that you wear your good underwear while using them.  Also, it is pretty hard to descreetly carry these in your purse, as they are VERY large. But other than that, I feel that they are an amazing product. Surprisingly, these pads don\'t feel like a diaper when I am wearing them, so that is a plus. However, I feel that women who are any smaller than a size twelve or fourteen might find them to be quite bulky, so I would take that into consideration. Also, if you are a woman who is already sticking two maximum coverage pads together just to feel comfortable, this maxi pad has about the same effect, so it will not be anything new to you. But overall, I will purchase these in the future."

I was staying at my sister\'s for a few days when I got my period unexpectedly, and she doesn\'t use these. So, when I had to use her regular pads, I was in hell for a day and half until I could go buy some of the Infinity pads. But, lesson learned. I stash one or two in every place I can in case of emergencies (ex: travel bags, different purses, cosmetics bag, you name it) so I never have to stress out again. It is just so comfortable, I sometimes forget that I\'m on my period and wearing a pad (leading to a danger of remembering to change).

Even the softest toilet paper doesn\'t compare to how gently this cleans and refreshes. I prefer Always to other brands because some of the others would dry up and others seemed soggy so, after using it, I had to crouch there for a while to air dry before pulling up my panties. Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient.The tub isn\'t too tacky looking and fits the wipes perfectly. It also keeps them from drying out. Once in awhile I\'ll accidentally pull out two wipes from the plastic sleeve, which is like facial tissue nearly impossible to get back in and never worth the effort. I\'ll lay the wipe on top of the pack and it will still be moist the next time I open the tub to use it."

Maybe it does and it\'s just not working, but I\'ve never experienced such a smelly pad in such a quick amount of time. When the menstrual blood hits the air it produces a smell and we all know it. You need something to counteract that smell and these pads seem to do nothing for that. You\'d better be changing these pads half-hourly if you want to avoid the period smell.

These wells increase the total surface area that liquid is in contact with the absorbent material and so the liquid not only passes through the surface layer faster, but it also gets absorbed faster by the inner material.Overall, this product does exactly what it claims to do.

However, I can see why they wouldn\'t be very absorbant for some people, because it seems to take a tad longer to absorb than other pads.  So I guess it just depends on the person\'s flow.For me, it\'s no better or worse than any other pad that I\'ve worn, absorbant-wise.  It\'s just more expensive.  I do, however, HATE ultra-thin pads because I think they feel like wearing paper.

147,147,20111102,B0029NYQ38,5,"November 2, 2011",A3S15YGZ6W6EV2,Better than any alternative that I\'ve found.,"I found these pads to be the best option for \'stuff\', by far. They are soft, absorbent, and are superb at keeping me clean and fresh. They cost a bit more than other alternatives, although I think it\'s well worth the confidence I have, knowing that I\'ll never have a problem when I use these.One gotcha:  Keep quiet if you bring a box of these to work and keep them in your desk. Less-prepared co-workers will beg, borrow and (usually) steal them once they discover how well they work.  This brings up the cost per use (for you) up by a whole lot.  I suggest hiding the contents of the box in an old Pampers wrapper.  This will keep all your co-workers far away from your \'stuff.\'"

We were happy with their performance under such \'conditions.\' We have two pad-wearing females in our house and I have to say, we go through the sanitary napkins. As always, this is the best brand. Always brand seems to do the best job providing protection from embarrassing messes and odors."

It\'s a bit hard to review the product itself since picking a pad is very much a personally preference, but I can vouch for these absorbancy and amazing thinness. Unless I\'m dragging myself through my heaviest, most unpleasant of days they get the job done: no leaks, no misses around the edges, even when I\'m tossing and turning in my sleep. Sorry if that\'s a bit TMI!"
