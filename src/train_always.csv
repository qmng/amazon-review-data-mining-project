265,267,20120322,B003CP15AE,4,"March 22, 2012",AQ1F3NP2G15S5,"Absorbent and dry; does not chafe, keeps everything hidden.","These sanitary pads are the best, they are highly absorbent and keeps you dry, there is no embarrassing odors, and it does not chafe.  A bulk pack is also now available at Warehouse stores,  I took one star off because the 4 pack is still expensive, all in all this is a great feminine protection product."
51,51,20101008,B001LK6QJW,1,"October 8, 2010",A1FVO9ZB49ZCXA,Tiny!,"I am a small person and these liners are TINY. They are not long and they are not wide either. I\'m talking DINKY. The description says \'Larger than our regular pad for overnight protection\' - I am scared to know how small their \'regular pad\' is, if this this considered the large size.I just spent $10.32 on them but I will have to go out to get some normal sizes. Don\'t waste your money!!!"
242,243,20100212,B0029NYQME,5,"February 12, 2010",A2O421DTA8J0RW,Lower price than the local stores,"This is a nice offering from Amazon. It\'s four packages each with 22 pads each. Doing the math in comparison to my local stores, buying these from Amazon with the free shipping is a whole lot cheaper."
299,302,20110907,B003CP15AE,5,"September 7, 2011",A3FBMSWBJ202SF,Comfortable and effective,"It is very absorbent and feels comfortable to the skin. On hot and humid days, it is still comfortable.The wings are long enough to catch some fluids, unlike the short ones.So, comfort and effectiveness both score high for me. I have been an Always user for quite some time. This line is one of my favorites."
329,332,20111123,B004J36GES,3,"November 23, 2011",ATYUQROTHLNYV,"Fine, I guess","Remember the old days of feminine hygiene, when pads were thick and scented and had no wings? When you could really FEEL like it was that time of the month?  Well, now you can relive those days, but better! With modern technology!These pads are durable, absorbent, stick well, and have a nice soft outer layer. But... well, they\'re bulky and wingless. I wasn\'t very comfortable, and I got leaks, but that\'s the nature of the design. If that\'s what you\'re looking for, these are a good choice. Though I wonder what you have against wings and super-thin pads."
117,117,20120424,B0029NYQ2E,5,"April 24, 2012",ADY4OCBSMNVKE,"Heavy Flo, great product",I have tried many different pads throughout the years and Infiniti by Always has been the best. My periods usually only last a couple of days but are heavy. I never seem to have any problems with it leaking or staining my clothing. They are very absorbent and very comfortable.
272,274,20111019,B003CP15AE,5,"October 19, 2011",A2ZMMQ4W17EK2N,Better price buying the 2 (32ct) boxes at 14.64 with a $1.00 off coupon,"Just wanted to fill you all in on this, you can purchase these in the 32(ct) boxes for only 14.64, you get 2 (32ct) boxes for that price of $14.64 plus a $1.00 off coupon through amazon. Just search amazon a little more and you should find them. Who wouldn\'t want to save $8.00? lolYes they are still sold through amazon so yes it is a way better deal. Hope this helps some of you out. & yes the product is amazing I must add."
300,303,20110907,B003CP15AE,5,"September 7, 2011",AID96A35CQO18,Hard to go wrong with Always!,"I will preface this review by saying I am already an Always customer. Although I\'m a loyal Always user, I had never tried their Infinity line of pads - honestly, I didn\'t know if they were that much better than their regular line to spend the extra bucks.Right away, I was shocked when opening the wrapper to see that the pad appears full of holes (over-my-head engineering towards absorbency, I suppose -- or perhaps aerodynamics? Ha!). Anyway, there IS a liner underneath, but it still looks a bit frightening. I bravely wore one, and yes, the absorbency and dryness was slightly better than the current Always products I use. The holes did their job.However, my favorite part of the Infinity pad is the wing design! I never would have thought much about it (wings are wings, I thought), but the Infinity pad has a scalloped \'B\' edge to its wing. I had more successful \'sticking\' of the Infinity\'s wing than I\'ve ever had with a normal curved \'D\' edged wing. Usually the wings (though very important and necessary to me in a pad), cause the most stress and hassle when applying! Part of it sticks, part of it doesn\'t and curls upward, leaving sticky spots exposed. Not comfortable. So, the \'B\' shaped edge of the Infinity pad was a plus!Overall, I would definitely use the Infinity pads again, but probably only if I had a coupon to defray the extra cost. Either way, I trust Always\' products for confident protection!"
150,150,20110607,B0029NYQ38,4,"June 7, 2011",A1H89NF4KKB97P,Good Pad for heavy days,I have been using Always Infinity for a year now.  I like the way it absorbs and keep the top layer pretty dry.  What I didn\'t like is the chemical smell that it had when I first started buying them (the ones I\'ve bought recently doesn\'t have this smell anymore).  Also I don\'t like how it is not that breatheable.  But overall it is a good pad and I will continue to use them.Pros: Thin  Super absorbancy  Top layer remains pretty dryCons: Not as breatheable  Chemical Smell
42,42,20100925,B001LK6Q92,5,"September 25, 2010",A2EKAKJ37ZXTAN,Outstanding!,My wife tried these because the ones she was using couldn\'t catch the overnight flow.  Specially when she got out of bed.These are so good she no longer has to put anything on the bed to protect it from overnight leaks or run to the bathroom when she stood up in the morning.Simply the best!
43,43,20100107,B001LK6Q92,5,"January 7, 2010",A2I1B7GHNP1JTA,Always a great product,I would buy no other brand and the price and free shipping through amazon make it a smart purchase.
9,9,20110913,B001G7QSGQ,5,"September 13, 2011",A230YPVP1QMFDQ,Review???,"My wife told me to order these, and I did!  She must approve of the product, because I\'ve done it three times now..."
399,403,20090611,B005P0SMW8,1,"June 11, 2009",ALMMQW5C8OKP9,Not impressed,"Well, I tried this for heartburn and acid reflux.  It worked for a couple of weeks, then not so much.  I didn\'t really mean to get this huge jug,itmust have been in my shopping cart, and when I purchased something else, it was included.  Hate that! Must be more careful next time."
131,131,20110806,B0029NYQ2E,5,"August 6, 2011",AWKKF1MOSV5SL,amazingly absorbent!,"I\'ve had my period since I was very young and I have always had a heavy flow. It was so hard not to prevent leaks with other pads. I would have to change my pad every 2 hours to prevent leaking . I loved always pads so I decided to see what all the commotion with always infinity was about. The pads are super absorbent and I can get more than 4 hours with it (which has never happened!). The pad can hold a lot of liquid. I would recommend this for anyone with heavy periods, who doesn\'t like to always wear tampons, but still has an active lifestyle!"
286,289,20110916,B003CP15AE,3,"September 16, 2011",A1OA2ZW406NQXM,"Excellent Absorption for the Size, But No Smell Protection","I do believe that the new Always Infinity pads have the best absorption rate around for their size, but I\'m still partial to another brand and I\'ll explain why. First, I do not like scented pads and this is unscented, which is good. What is bad is that it doesn\'t seem to have any baking soda or odor absorbers. Maybe it does and it\'s just not working, but I\'ve never experienced such a smelly pad in such a quick amount of time. When the menstrual blood hits the air it produces a smell and we all know it. You need something to counteract that smell and these pads seem to do nothing for that. You\'d better be changing these pads half-hourly if you want to avoid the period smell. I would not wear this type of pad outside the home due to my insecurities about the lack of smell protection and the need to change them so frequently (due to smell) which is inconvenient. I\'m very picky about smells. If I can smell it, then others can too - no good."
201,201,20111101,B0029NYQ9W,5,"November 1, 2011",A1WW7MRCX1Z4QO,Price is unbeatable,"I received this item on time. the item itself is of good quality, each liner is very thin and of ideal length, also wrapped individually, which is convenient and hygienic. As I said before the price is unbeatable, compare to smaller packs in the nearest stores and pharmacies."
53,53,20091023,B001LK6QJW,4,"October 23, 2009",A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,Dependable protection,"Always thin pantiliners are great for those very light spotting days -- mild protection without the bulk and humidity, if you know what I mean.  I like them because they hold in place well, they protect my clothing.  They are individually wrapped, which makes them more portable; and they are so lightweight and comfortable, I don\'t even know they are there.  That\'s important, because some brands are stiff and feel a bit like cardboard.  I prefer the unscented variety but scented is fine."
282,285,20110921,B003CP15AE,5,"September 21, 2011",A1X4L7AO1BXMHK,Improvement over the regular line,"I actually really liked this product.  The inner core of the pad was much more effective than other Always products I have used in the past.  It didn\'t feel bulky and I never felt it twist or shift.  The wings worked well and stayed in place.  I felt the key was the absorption and how it kept everything in place, never tore or felt uncomfortable.  The price is a bit higher than the regular pads however."
313,316,20110823,B003CP15AE,4,"August 23, 2011",A2ZKQC0XCIIAEM,They are what they are,"Ive never been a big fan of pads, they feel like diapers to me. Having said that sometimes there is a need to wear them like at night on a real heavy day along with a tampon. These are Fantastic for this, they dont have any irritating scent but at the same time dont allow for any female type odor to leak out. Very absobant and comfortable, a good thing to have around in case of emergencies.I will probably keep some of these in my house from here on out. Highly recommended even if u arent someone who uses pads. Well done Always!!"
204,204,20110717,B0029NYQ9W,5,"July 17, 2011",AEV8CKWVX20CU,Lots of Liners!!!,I have been using these liners for years. Simply the BEST!Perfect size: I do not always have my handbag on me... so the Always Thin liners are so discreet. In my pocket and out of sight. Sometimes I forget that I even have it on me. Hee hee.Perfect for everyday use: These liners are sooo super thin that I never notice its presence. I love them!Thank god that they come in the \'unscented\' liners. All that added \'scent\' or \'perfume\' is so unnecessary.These supersede Carefree liners and the store brand liners.Every female should try them!!!
130,130,20110903,B0029NYQ2E,5,"September 3, 2011",A2ZMMQ4W17EK2N,The best switch ever,"Have been using these for over a year now, & I love them. Even though they are expensive I always luck up on a coupon when I need more. Now that i have found these on amazon I will start buying them from here instead of from the store. Since if I buy these in the store I would be paying $14.00 for two boxes. Great save, great deal, great product."
210,210,20101211,B0029NYQB0,5,"December 11, 2010",A21K28EQ023UUU,my favorites,"these are very thin, glue well to the underwear, stay put...not visible.....I use them when I wear regular panties, not thongsbeen using these for years now, the best out there"
304,307,20110906,B003CP15AE,5,"September 6, 2011",A3HETHW2XD3DWH,Barely know they\'re there,"These ALWAYS pads are everything they claim to be.  With stay put wings, they don\'t shift, and the design is so thin you will forget you\'re even wearing a maxi pad.  These are unscented and come in a package of 16.  They are extremely absorbent and easy to dispose in a handy green wrapper when you are changing.  I hate bulk, but on heavy flow days there is sometimes no choice.  Now thanks to INFINITY pads, I have a choice, and my number one choice is Always Infinity."
55,55,20090908,B001LK6QJW,3,"September 8, 2009",A39FXOW0UFENSL,Not what I thought it was,These are too small for my needs.  I thought I was getting something bigger.  Be careful to check your purchases thouroughly before buying!
307,310,20110902,B003CP15AE,5,"September 2, 2011",ATYUQROTHLNYV,"The best, no question","I don\'t want to get into to all the grody details of my expertise in this topic, and I bet you don\'t want me to either. Trust me: if you need serious protection, look no further. Always Infinity is the best.  The pads absorb quickly, feel dry, and hold a huge amount. They stick well and handle wear and tear (like lots of walking) with no trouble. They\'re pretty thin and easy to carry around.I find this length to be best. The shorter ones sometimes leak, and the longer one is so huge it gets a bit uncomfortable and icky. But the whole Infinity line is great.I wind up reversing the front and back, because that\'s what works for me."
380,384,20111008,B005P0SMW8,5,"October 8, 2011",A1MRHRKQS745KB,Works for a multitude of problems!!!,"-I had acid reflux which had been seriously aggravated when I fell and struck my upper abdomen on a hard object causing a hiatal hernia.-I have Celiac disease which is a malfunction of the small intestines and causes a lot of undigested food to pass into the large intestines where it putrefies and causes all sorts of problems including bowel irregularity.-I had inflammation in my muscles and joints.-All of these things combined caused me to be miserable and tired much of the time and seriously impacted my ability to eat many things and just get things done.I tried the \'other\' so called fantastic brands that taste very sour.  They aggravated all my symptoms and made them worse.  I was in a supplement store and the clerk recommended aloe vera to which I said \'No way, I tried it already\'.  He said \'Oh, you tried the other stuff.  Let me introduce you to George\'s\'.My life improved dramatically almost immediately.  All the symptoms disappeared or diminished.  I even tried going off the stuff after a week and the symptoms returned.  Since then I keep a couple of gallons around all the time.  If I forget to use it my body lets me know in 3 or 4 days and I go back on it.  I only have to drink 1 or 2 ounces a day.These people who are saying this is water or that it doesn\'t work are suspect as far as I am concerned.  Do they work for the competition?  Do they have a beef with George\'s?  Did they take it correctly?  What else are they taking or eating and drinking?  Do they think the FDA would let George\'s get away with selling water?  You know how much the FDA would love to put the supplement business out of business!  They have tried hard enough.I know it works and I have recommended it to many others who are happy drinkers of George\'s Aloe Vera juice now.  Too bad I can\'t give it 6 stars.  This is a small price to pay for so many benefits."
355,358,20110912,B004J36GES,5,"September 12, 2011",AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,Well-designed product,"This is from my wife: pad is comfortable and long enough to catch any excess. I barely felt it wearing it. It says lightly scented but I didn\'t smell anything at all, which is OK by me. Recommended."
70,70,20100212,B00284B5AK,5,"February 12, 2010",A703NBX12U2JX,Just right!,"Always Dri-liners work perfectly without being too bulky. It fits nicely and stays put.Overall, I\'m very pleased with this product."
66,66,20110217,B00284B4PQ,5,"February 17, 2011",A16C62QMEB8MWS,Finally!  Genius,"It\'s a little weird writing a review about maxipads, but I feel that so few get endorsed and there\'s so many different brands out there.  I have to say that I LOVE THESE!  They are super thin (like paper), the thinnest I have ever seen.  In my opinion, they are only for protecting you from a tampon leak (I\'m sorry for the visual, but it\'s true) or if you have regular discharge.  The amazing thing is that you can adjust the shape if you want them to be thong style or regular panty liner.  It\'s way better than stashing 2 different types of items in your purse.  They are so thin that you dont even realize you have them on."
317,320,20110822,B003CP15CC,3,"August 22, 2011",A11ZKKYHH2S68V,They\'re not that amazing,"I have read reviews saying that the Always Infinity do not absorb anything.  I guess that just depends on the type of flow you have, because they do seem to absorb well for me and other people.  However, I can see why they wouldn\'t be very absorbant for some people, because it seems to take a tad longer to absorb than other pads.  So I guess it just depends on the person\'s flow.For me, it\'s no better or worse than any other pad that I\'ve worn, absorbant-wise.  It\'s just more expensive.  I do, however, HATE ultra-thin pads because I think they feel like wearing paper.  But these don\'t feel like that.The thing that leaves me scratching my head is the almost-triangular SHAPE of the pad.  Perhaps a man designed it, because the shape makes absolutely no sense at all whatsoever."
341,344,20110929,B004J36GES,5,"September 29, 2011",AY91MQZZR750W,\'Always\' a great product,I\'ve been a regular purchaser of Always products for many years. They work as promised and are the best pads I\'ve ever tried. With the wraparound wings and long length there\'s no need to worry about leaks. Adding odor-lock and a light fragrance to the pads makes a great product even better.
314,317,20110328,B003CP15AE,5,"March 28, 2011",ADG3MQEKSX116,Amazing...,"Its kind of embarrassing to write a review on pads, but this is how good they are...They make me want to tell every girl out there.  I would give them 6 stars if could.  If you use pads, these are the *only* ones to get.  The material is very different from the normal ones but its super absorbent.  Plus its thinner and softer.  I will never go back to regular ones!"
271,273,20111020,B003CP15AE,4,"October 20, 2011",A1LGB9RZX3SR0P,Great Product,"I\'ve only ever consistently used Always brand pads, so I was excited to try these new Infinity pads. It\'s the only pad I\'ll use now.  They work great!  They are more absorbent than previous, thicker pads, but I wouldn\'t use them on super heavy days, or overnight.  They absorb quickly and keep you feeling drier and the wings are wonderful for providing extra protection.  I just wish that pad makers would stop making the outside wrapper so bright in color.  It\'s hard to be discreet with a bright green wrapper announcing to the world that you have your period.JUST A NOTE: I didn\'t write this review - my wife did."
34,34,20100722,B001GCTTJY,5,"July 22, 2010",A3NG1RH09BPOO,Woman\'s thing,"I purchased these because I didn\'t feel like going into the store.  For the service of being delivered right to my door I would purchase these again.  But if I do go into the stores, Walmart has these for a cheaper price.  The service was great though because these were shipped to me immediately."

When I saw George\'s Aloe Vera I had high hopes for it as it had 5 stars which was very impressive and the price was much lower. One thing they claim is that it tastes like water. I\'ve confirmed this fact, however I\'ve also concluded that it smells like water, has the same consistency as water, transparency and even evaporates and doesn\'t leave any film at all, just like water. I\'ve found no improvements with this product however with the other aloe I did. My conclusion, this is really a good deal for this much aloe, but I think it\'s because it\'s not aloe, it\'s actually water. Expensive water."
153,153,20100731,B0029NYQ38,5,"July 31, 2010",AO2AFR6B5GOSW,BEST EVER!,"These are super absorbent, and I\'ve never had a problem with leaking like I have with other types."

Product arrived in a timely fashion and as described.  This product, IMHO is the best overnite protection available.  Nothing I\'ve ever used before these worked as well, absorbed as much or was easy on my skin as these. Would buy again and again."
229,230,20111009,B0029NYQEC,4,"October 9, 2011",A181SUU47ABBT6,In Between Cycles and Light Days,"Although these are \'panty liners\', I use them between cycles and also use them on my light days. I think for a panty liner they work really well. You can hardly feel them, they give me the confidence knowing I won\'t be surprised by mother nature, are easily packed into a purse or bag for on the go. I gave them 4 stars as opposed to 5 because, although they are soft (in my opinion) they aren\'t as soft as Always \'Infinicel Technology\' pads, which I also love - but thats a different review!"

It\'s very comfortable and I\'ve never had any problem with leaks. This pad does such a good job of wicking away the flow that you are in danger of not knowing when it is time to change. How can something this thin be so absorbent?  The science behind this pads performance won them a prestigious Edison Award. I will never use anything else."
158,158,20120123,B0029NYQ6A,3,"January 23, 2012",A55QPGGF1YAJJ,I like it but it needs to be thicker and longer....,I have a very heavy flow. At night during my heavy days I have to where two purple pads. During the day when I have my heavy days I where the Pink Maximum with wings first then on top of that I have to put one Overnight Purple pad. Always needs to improve some more on the purple pads. They need to be much thicker especially in the middle and longer. Can anyone let me know where I could buy in bulk and on sale the Purple overnight pads with wings and the Pink Maximum with wings? Thanks I would appreciate it if someone can help me with this.
137,137,20100515,B0029NYQ2E,5,"May 15, 2010",A2PPKOUDNFPD3,Shocked!,"I got a free sample of this to try, thinking it would be like any other Always pad (which is my favorite brand, after all), but boy was I wrong! When I first opened it, I was confused. I\'d never seen anything like it. It was so strangely light and yet didn\'t seem like it should be. The material made me think of memory foam, only super soft textured.With how thin it was at the top, I didn\'t think it would be impressive for my flow (I have endometriosis, so that means I always have to wear overnight or better, maximum protection pads to keep up with my super flow, sometimes in addition to a tampon, which I hate wearing). Well, it worked great and it really felt like I didn\'t have anything on.I decided to actually buy the product this period to see if it was just a fluke and put it to the test immediately with my worst time--overnight on my heaviest night. When even the best pads have failed me in the past.Not a drop off the pad. The wings held and only in one place did it even leave the center of the top (the entire bottom was filled). And I felt DRY. If I hadn\'t seen the bottom, I\'d have thought maybe there was no flow overnight.I tried another today and got that familiar \'overproducing\' feeling that always leads to pad failure. I went to the bathroom, expecting a mess and the pad had contained it completely. It hadn\'t approached any edges. I was shocked and amazed. I\'ve never had a pad work this well, in 15 years of super-heavy periods, that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage.What\'s more, I almost always get irritation on this day in my cycle. Nada. I am SOLD.So, to recap: it held more than any other pad I\'ve seen that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage. It left NO irritation on a heavy day. It worked overnight on my worst night. And I feel dry--it absorbs faster than anything I\'ve ever worn. I\'ve never felt compelled to review a product as strongly as this before, lol. Probably hormones ;)"

I\'m a size 14 and the pad goes from the front all the way to the back of my panties. It has wings in the front and the back. I no longer have to wear 2 pads put together, which the one in the back always ended up shifting. If you have a super heavy flow this is the pad for you. No more waking up to wet underwear or stained sheets looking like a murder scene because a regular overnight pad cant contain your flow. But don\'t just use them for overnight, great for daytime use as well. Highly recommended!"

I\'m concerned that a few people\'s loudly-stated assumption that the scent caused their infections may have convinced the company to drop them rather than have negative PR.Infections CAN happen, arguably more often if you\'re hypersensitive or do not keep reasonably clean. Liners should certainly be changed before aroma has a chance to develop, every few hours if necessary, but how much easier and more effective it is to swap out a liner than one\'s panties when you\'re on the go! And it\'s exactly when you\'re running all over in public that rhe extra security of this style is a gift!"

They are thin, the top stays pretty much dry/a bit damp, and they absorb a lot.

These are made from what I can only describe as a \'Dr. Scholl\'s-like\' material.  The pad is VERY comfortable and definitely breathes.  If you\'re an active female, or have an extremely heavy flow, then you should definitely be conscious of having to change out the pad throughout the day.  These Infinity pads are SUPER absorbent - what\'s seen on the surface of the pad is only about 1/3 of what\'s actually being held.  So please keep that in mind.  I normally have a heavy flow and sometimes had issues at night (I sleep on my belly) and that was always a big problem during \'my time\' when the pad I\'d use would leak.  Not at all the case with these!Always Infinity DOES tend to cost more than other brands, but if you keep an eye out (as I do) you can find a decent in-store sale.

I was impressed with the quality of the pad; definitely explains why it cost more. Its actually quite thin compared to other pads that claim \'heavy absorbency\' , and the texture/density reminds me of  a makeup applicator sponge. The double wings was a good idea, but like some of the reviewers have mentioned- it did not seems to stick as well to certain underwear, and if it can\'t be relied on to stick well on EVERY underwear in your drawer, well- the reliability issue is moot already! And reliability is important if your are out and about, in and out of chairs, meeting with people constantly, and can\'t always run to the restroom when you feel that doomsday leakage- b/c then,  please don\'t rely on this pad.  When I have a heavy day- its heavy like Niagara Falls heavy where it feels like 1/2 pint just unleashes in one split second (sorry for the graphics, but I\'m trying to make a point, and those who have my type of heavy will know exactly what I mean), and this little fella just did not do it for me on a busy day when I don\'t have a restroom to run to. The absorbency rate on this high-tech pad is TOO SLOW for my type of \'Unleash thy furry\' Heavy days, and it just seemed to spill over the side like a shallow raft that can not contain its occupants (while going over the edge of Niagara Falls).  Every time I wore it on a heavy day, my underwear was dirtied to the extent where an extra pair of underwear was necessary! Does it sound gross? Yes- it was.  It you want to avoid grossness, do avoid this pad!  I saved the pad for my guaranteed light days and was able to finish my high tech pads in that manner, but I would not buy this again. Too bad- it does look and feel promising.  Hope my frank and honest review helps out any undecided non-tampon users."

They wash up really easy in my experience and you don\'t have to worry about chemicals. I also end up having less leaks, less itchiness etc when using cloth pads.Another alternative that I highly recommend is a menstrual cup. I have a seriously heavy flow and menstrual cups work wonderfully. (I\'m talking about the silicone kind that you wash and reuse)They hold about twice as much flow as a tampon and I wear cloth pads or liners for back up. I can wear a menstrual cup comfortably but I\'m unable to wear tampons. Most tampons are also full of icky chemicals.Natracare is a good brand of disposable menstrual protection that doesn\'t have all the icky chemicals if you just can\'t bring yourself to try the other things or if you need something disposable sometimes."

I found this to be a huge plus, especially when worn overnight.  No chafing or irritation, even when worn while working out for about an hour.- Reliability: No leaks or staining even with heavy flow.  The channels on the pad help to lock in flow plus I found the pad stays in place very well, especially for a pad without wings.- Thickness: Here\'s where these pads lose some points.  A fellow reviewer compared these to a baby\'s diaper - I agree these are quite thick but willing to accept that for the positive factors above.  For overnight use the thickness of this pad isn\'t too big of a deal, but I wouldn\'t recommend wearing this pad under very tight fitting clothing (then again, maybe tight fitting clothes aren\'t such a good idea for the days you need a super maxi!)"

Even the softest toilet paper doesn\'t compare to how gently this cleans and refreshes. I prefer Always to other brands because some of the others would dry up and others seemed soggy so, after using it, I had to crouch there for a while to air dry before pulling up my panties. Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient.The tub isn\'t too tacky looking and fits the wipes perfectly. It also keeps them from drying out. Once in awhile I\'ll accidentally pull out two wipes from the plastic sleeve, which is like facial tissue nearly impossible to get back in and never worth the effort. I\'ll lay the wipe on top of the pack and it will still be moist the next time I open the tub to use it."

Even on my heaviest days I didn\'t have any leaks and I didn\'t feel bulky as I sometimes can feel. The new design has a wider back and channels that help with faster absorption.

I bought these mainly to have a portable wipe for work, when forced to use public restrooms (never know if there will be TP once you get in the stall!), or any other time away from home. 4 stars only because I do not particularly care for the added fragrance, and would prefer an adult \'baby wipe\' that is more gentle for sensitive areas.

Always Infinity is designed to draw moisture to the bottom of the pad, leaving the top virtually dry! It\'s amazing. It can be a bit misleading as the top looks dry and the bottom will be completely soaked however once you\'re aware of your flow it\'s not difficult to know when you\'re due for a change.

These came as a sample in one of those packages. What an excellent marketing ploy. I did not think they could improve Always Ultrathins but they have.COMFORTAlways Infinity are oh so soft, thin and dry. Compared to Ultrathins, Inifinity feels more like tissue paper. They keep me drier than Ultrathins by somehow drawing the moisture away from me. With Ultrathins I feel dry. With these, I feel drier. I feel like I don\'t have any pads on.PROTECTIONI will not buy pads without wings. Always Infinity has double wings. Not sure if the double wings are actually better than single wings, but wings are wings and they do protect the sides of the panties just like the Ultrathin with Wings do.The back of the overnight Infinity is longer and wider than the front of the pad for that leakage that seeps backwards. So far, I have not had any accidents. The Infinity regular size, of course, doesn\'t have this added length in the back. I find the regular size adequate for daytime protection.Always Infinity are the most absorbant pads I\'ve ever used. Don\'t know what technology they have, but he moisture is pulled away from me and locked inside. When I change them, I feel they could still absorb so much more. With Ultrathins, I usually think they are at the end of their life.PROS:+wings+thin+keeps moisture away+most absorbant+soft and comfortable+overnights are longer and wider in backCONS:-NONE! Don\'t know how they\'ll improve these!SUMMARYAt the risk of sounding like I work for the company (I don\'t have any ties, trust me), try these. You\'ll be a convert.UPDATE:  Yes, I\'ve been using these ever since I\'ve been introduced to them.  The different lengths correspond exactly to what I need -- regular, heavy and overnight.  There\'s even a little note on each one telling me which side goes forward.  Still haven\'t found any cons."

Generally, I go for pads that are long and have wings. These particular pads are not the kind I usually go for but I decided to give them a shot. I was actually pleasantly surprised with these!Let\'s talk about the positives first. I generally can\'t go through a period without ruining at least one pair of underwear. I can say that with these, I didn\'t soil my underwear at all. Not even one drop. Also, I\'ve found that pads that don\'t have wings tend to move around a bit but these stayed firmly in place.Now for a couple of negatives. First, as I said above, I like pads with wings. When I wear pads without wings, I\'m always afraid that the pad is going to shift and I\'m going to bleed right through my pants. Although I didn\'t have a problem with these pads, I wish they had wings just for the peace of mind. Second, I don\'t think the light scent did anything to control the odor.Overall, these work pretty well in absorbing and staying put.

For me, I\'d buy it again on sale but I still prefer my ultra thin maxi pads of a different brand.  I also think pads with wings offer more protection for side leaks."

I was at Target a few weeks ago looking for pads when I noticed that Always Infinity was on sale. Ever since they debuted I had basically avoided them like the plague because they\'re more expensive than Always Ultrathins with wings and I had a sneaking suspicion that the product was more hype than substance. But another customer saw me mulling the purchase over and insisted that I buy it. \'Oh, it holds a lot!\' she gushed (no pun intended). \'Trust me!\'Okay, so I did. I bought a box of \'heavy flow\' Infinity plus another box of Ultrathins for \'back up.\' And thank God I did! These pads have got to be the weirdest and most ineffectual maxis I have ever tried. When I first opened one up, I was horrified. First of all, the \'pad\' isn\'t at all like the cotton pad you would expect from a feminine napkin. The material is some kind of \'compressed material\', very similar in feel, flatness and texture to one of those oldskool white spongy Doctor Scholl\'s inserts. It even had the same type of holes in it (at the front of the pad). Making matters worse, there were some goofy markings in the back of the pad, making it look more like some futuristic landing strip at a spaceport than a maxi pad.And the entire thing was tiny. It was so small I had to double check to make sure which size pad I had gotten. But nope, this was indeed the heavy flow pad I was trying out.At any rate, I tried it out and holy frijoles, the adhesive was so weak, the wings couldn\'t attach properly. So I kept pressing them again and they flopped back out like they went, \'OH, NO SHE DIDN\'T! SHE DID NOT TRY STICKING US TO HER UNDERWEAR!\' By this point, my patience was wearing thin, but I had a box of these and was determined to try them out. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Within an hour I could see that flow was leaking/ rolling past the perimeters of the pad. I decided not to chance the pads as my period went into its heavy flow stage and went with my regular Ultrathin Overnights. Then when my flow went light again, I tried the Infinity again for one night. Woke up the next morning and saw that after pooling in the middle, the very little flow I\'d had hopped, skipped, and rolled past the futuristic spaceport landing strip markings in the back of the pad and then found its \'happy place\' in the back of my underwear. Nice.Needless to say, I wasn\'t happy with these  and will still keep using Ultrathins. There\'s one plus side-- if I experience shoe pain in the future and there are no Dr. Scholl\'s inserts to be had, I can use these instead."

So they have lasted me for quite a while.Sorry for the side bar, but I had to add that in there in case some of you have been wondering why you are having such heavy cycles.At any rate, this product works! Go out and get it and keep it in stock for your just in case days!"

Finally tired of wearing an overnight level absorbancy pad and a tampon just to be on the safe side, I decided to find another option. I saw a package of Always Overnight Extra Heavy Flow Maxi pads at my local Wal-Mart, and I thought it wouldn\'t hurt to try them out. W-o-w. First of all, this is a VERY long pad. It is about the length of two Always Ultra-Thin Overnight pads stuck together, and it pretty much expands from the top of my underwear to the back of them. Another helpful feature is that this pad contains two sets of wings--one in the middle like traditional pads and another set at the back. While, these pads DEFINITELY prevent leaks, I have a few complaints about this product. First of all, I\'ve noticed that when you remove the pad, it leaves a thin adhesive strip on your underwear that is hard to remove. So, though these pads keep you from having accidents, I still do not recommend that you wear your good underwear while using them.  Also, it is pretty hard to descreetly carry these in your purse, as they are VERY large. But other than that, I feel that they are an amazing product. Surprisingly, these pads don\'t feel like a diaper when I am wearing them, so that is a plus. However, I feel that women who are any smaller than a size twelve or fourteen might find them to be quite bulky, so I would take that into consideration. Also, if you are a woman who is already sticking two maximum coverage pads together just to feel comfortable, this maxi pad has about the same effect, so it will not be anything new to you. But overall, I will purchase these in the future."

I often get what the chinese call \'Liver Yang Rising\', which results in a lot of hot tempered conditions.  Aloe Vera is very Yin tonifying, and it\'s always brought me great balance.  I love it.I was in the Vitamin Store, and saw this George\'s aloe.  I always buy the Lily of the Desert stuff, but this caught my eye, and I bought it. The price was similar in comparison.  I thought, what the heck, I\'ll give it a try.I\'m about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, and I now realize that I notice NONE of the beneficial Yin tonifying effects that traditional Aloe Vera Juice gives you.  Pretty much none whatsoever.  This Aloe tastes like distilled water.  Has no taste whatsoever.  A good part of Aloe\'s medicine is in the bitter.  All medicines in nature have a bitter tasting element to them.  Bitter is healing.  When you remove the bitter, I\'m not so sure it\'s healing anymore.I was reading through the testiominals on here, and they all seem stomach related.  Perhaps it has a beneficial effect on stomach woes, but since I don\'t have any, it did nothing for me.  It had no effect on my Liver Yang Rising, and I feel like the cooling, Yin tonifying effects just aren\'t there with this aloe.Not a big deal, wasted some money, but I\'m going right back to Lily of the Desert."

I will never use anyother ones besides these Infinity.Mainly because they are so soft. It feels like those packing styrophome thin sheets that they wrap around the TV screen when you first open the box. That type of smooth and cushiny type feel, just thicker than this sheet.

Heavy and extra heavy pads were never absorbent enough. The similar sized (i.e. extra thick) pads would not stay fitted properly and caused leaks. The thicker pads I tried also twisted around to adhesive side up which was both very uncomfortable and caused them to not absorb correctly, so was also messy. I am concerned about toxic shock syndrome so I do not use tampons. I tried every brand of \'overnight\' or \'extra heavy\' pads out there at the time and none of them were up to it. I found these about three years ago and have not tried another heavy flow overnight pad since.With these Always brand Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings I never have to use more than one at a time. I\'ve never had leaks when using these pads and I don\'t have problems with them twisting around to adhesive side up. If you have extremely heavy menstrual flow then you should try these pads.It is true that they are extremely long and very thick. The pad length is such that some cuts of underwear will be too small (or short) in the back if you place the pad correctly. This causes the pad to overhang or stick out of the back of the underwear. This is remedied easily, but can be inconvenient. If this is something that you cannot stand then you should not get these pads.Regarding price, currently Amazon is offering a two pack for about 12 dollars. I\'ve seen big differences in price depending on where you get them (between 12 -20 for one pack)this is the lowest price I have seen so far (about 6 dollars for one pack)."

My son has a severe peanut allergy, and apparently with allergies comes eczema (skin condition that causes open sores).  We\'ve used steroids with limited results, and we don\'t like using it very much nor does my son as it\'s a pretty strong medicine.For some reason, my memory was triggered and I remembered my Japanese mother growing aloe plants and using them on us when we had an injury or received a burn (happens when you grow up on a farm).  I wasn\'t thinking of prevention, but healing his open sores that were getting pretty bad--on his arms, behind his legs, on his feet, and on his inner thighs.  (He is entering his teenage years, and is obviously very sensitive about his skin.  The kids at school always ask why he wears long pants, and not shorts like they do in school and after school).Long story short, I came across \'George\'s Aloe\' and thought what the heck, can\'t hurt.  It\'s a natural product and worth a try.  I also read that Aloe is a natural antihistimine.  We\'ve been using it for a week on our son, and the results are very positive.  It hasn\'t prevented the outbreaks, but it has diminished them noticeably.  I would say upwards of 80% improvement.  The spring is the worst time for my son, and it\'s been very manageable.  My wife and I have noticed a significant improvement in his condition and he drinks a small glass of George\'s Aloe every morning.  I tried it, and it indeed does take like water.  Read the directions, though, as you don\'t need much.I\'ve since supplemented the \'internal\' treatment with an external treatment of the actual aloe plant rubbed on the outside of his body (arms, legs, feet, etc.).  You basically just cut off a very small part of the leaf, and it\'s a gel inside.  I rub that on his sores, pimples, and hives and paired with the Aloe juice, has had a dramatic effect, a definite improvement for the better.  My son is much more relaxed of late, and very happy with the results.  It\'s not perfect by any means, but he itches a LOT less and he doesn\'t have the open weeping sores that he had before.  Again, it\'s not perfect, but a huge improvement.I think for others in the same situation, it\'s worth a try.  I would just make sure there isn\'t some sort of allergy to it--but I\'ve never heard of an allergic reaction to Aloe.Finally, my wife has tried a lot of remedies on my son: lotions, aforementioned steroids, hot showers followed by vaseline to keep the moisture in, etc., and none of them has had the same noticeable positive effect as Warren Laboratories \'George\'s Aloe\'.A very enthusiastic and strong 5 Stars for this product.I hope you find a use for it, too."

I have been on Nexium for 5+ years & get a little concerned about taking it for so long, even though my gastroenterologist says it\'s fine. I have not been able to go one day without taking Nexium until I started drinking George\'s Aloe. A friend of mine heard about George\'s Aloe from her holistic pharmacist. George\'s Aloe has no taste or texture - it\'s like drinking water. I drink about 2 oz. every other day - the days I don\'t take Nexium.Another side benefit is that my hair is thicker. My beautician noticed that my hair wasn\'t falling out like it used to, and we attributed it to George\'s Aloe.One of the reasons I decided aloe might work for me is because when I was visiting St. John, USVI, I went on an island tour. Our tour guide pulled to the side of the road & showed us an aloe plant. He said that when their babies get sick, they put a little aloe in their baby bottles & they get better.

Even the softest toilet paper doesn\'t compare to how gently this cleans and refreshes. I prefer Always to other brands because some of the others would dry up and others seemed soggy so, after using it, I had to crouch there for a while to air dry before pulling up my panties. Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient."

I too have fibroids and a major bleeding problem - clots, which are very hard to absorb.  I have to sleep with a towel under me and try to discreetly sit on a folder at work if I go to a meeting, it\'s so embarrassing.  Also with the fibroids and polycystic ovaries I have a questionable cycle and will skip months then bleed for weeks at a time (yes I know I need to just have the surgery lol).  I needed the pads stat so I bought them locally and woke up several times with no leaks for the first time in 10 or so years. I feel like today I can run errands without worrying about my tan leather interior, restaraunt chairs or spotting.  This is major, especially for a person who has had a month long period.  The amazon pricing with super saver shipping offers is a much better deal than my local store so I will be back here to buy in bulk.  I also bought the Always overnight super sonic maxi based on reviews and will try that out and leave a review.Thank you Always, thank you Amazon, and thank you reviewers!**UPDATE**  Back on here to buy more of this product, at a better price than my local store.  Still love them and have referred several friends who were also heavy period sufferers.  We all love them.  Also, try the overnight extra heavy flow with wings!  This pad must be at least 14\' long, great for my needs and especially plus size women.  The overnight feels a tad diaper-ish to wear by day, but still works if you need it.  The fit is great on both, I don\'t experience as much bunching and they stay in place. So glad to have my stress level reduced related to spotting and I don\'t have to wear black clothes every day!"

Finally, Always Infinity came along, and I\'ve been thrilled!Infinity Heavy Flow is perfect for  when I\'m having a heavy flow or need prolonged protection at night, when I need my pad to provide me with plenty of absorption.  The wings keep the pad secure, they actually wrap around and stick to my panty and the softness keeps me comfortable.  I like not thinking about my pad.  I also like that the pad is designed to be wider in the back.  I\'ve had experiences where my flow completely missed the pad, due to it being too short.  Length is very important if you\'re sitting or laying down for long periods of time.  Also, this is a good pad if you\'re a plus-sized lady.  What length size you choose also depends on your weight too, not just your flow.Out of the various pads that I\'ve purchased, I find that the Infinity series is a bit more expensive, but it is worth the extra change for the comfort and security.  Always Infinity Regular was my go to pad, but now, since trying out the Infinity Heavy Flow, I think I\'ll start using these for nighttime. A big plus, is that this brand comes in unscented, yea!

Also, although I got these through the Vine program (free), the price through Amazon is very reasonable and if you\'re like and you have Prime, free shipping!"

My husband and I are trying it out for his eczema. And I heard it can work to help coprophagic dogs, so we are giving some to our dog. This is the best aloe vera drink available. It is expensive, but worth it!"
