They are definitely much larger (width and length) than any liners I have ever used, and they are very absorbent, so you continue to feel fresh.  I hope they never stop making them."
48,48,20110208,B001LK6QJW,5,"February 8, 2011",A2IEK7OUWM4NJQ,Always Pantliner Thin (Unscented),"Hi,These are tiny and barely noticeable. I love them. What I do for my light days is overlap them to make a wide, yet very thin pantiliner. Works like a charm! And it will not leak if you stretch you panties flat while overlapping them. I promise they are not a waste and they will save your panties! I love them b/c I can\'t feel them at all, even with 2 overlapping!And only buy the unscented- the scented one smells like you are on your period! I have been using this for over a year and never had a leaking issue!"

Doing the math in comparison to my local stores, buying these from Amazon with the free shipping is a whole lot cheaper."
398,402,20090614,B005P0SMW8,5,"June 14, 2009",A2QXMEWCYVS50W,A must have!,"This is a product it would do everyone well to have as a staple in their homes.  It offers instant relief from stomach discomfort yet tastes like good spring water.  I prefer it chilled and keep some always ready in my fridge.  It also works as a topical for cuts or irritations.Our first experience with the product was after radiation burns when my husband was in treatment.  As the saliva glands had been destroyed and he needed to cary a water bottle all the time, we were told about George\'s Aloe Vera (none other will work as well). This became his saving grace.There are many many uses, it\'s pure and has taken awards for its excellence.  I try not to be without it and have ordered it for friends and family, especially those who have been ill.Ordering via Amazon.com has always been the best way to get the product as it is not available locally.  Every vendor has been exceptional in getting it to me."
327,330,20111128,B004J36GES,5,"November 28, 2011",A6VSWJVTWEOII,Comfortable and reliable,"I got these for Amazon Vine and was a little worried I wouldn\'t have much to say in a review, but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this product is. I was a little afraid that the \'odor lock\' stuff would be irritating or obtrusive but I did not find it to be such at all. I found these to be a good length and thickness and not prone to leaks. And with the Subscribe and Save option it\'s a good buy considering it\'s a brand name product. I will purchase these again."

I don\'t usually use the Long Super variety of Always, but since the birth of my third baby my cycle has been a bit out of control.  These are great because they provide ultimate coverage and absorbancy!!!"

Last week, my neighbor had like gallons of that shuff coming out of her.  All the damn Maxi pads in the world wouldn\'t clean that mess up!  I tried to lure a deer into the house to lick it all up, since deer eat nasty stuff, but the deer couldn\'t even clean up all that menstral blood!  So I had to shoot the deer, which left even more blood, deer brain splatter, and mess all over the floor.  My neighbor lady went to the store to get more Maxi pads to clean it all up, but when she was gone, I decided it was best to just burn her house down.  But I didn\'t know that my pet squirrel (and best friend and lover) was in her house and it got burned up in the fire, so now I have to train a new squirrel to be my lover.Shame on you Maxi Pads!"
232,233,20110216,B0029NYQEC,5,"February 16, 2011",A2ZJ835WQ7JNGT,best pantyliner,"This pantyliner is perfect for me because it is very absorbent, but is the size of a regular pantyliner, instead of a pad.  I use them daily between cycles.  These pantyliners have actually prevented yeast infections for me, which I was getting every several months with other pantyliners that were not as absorbent.  They always adhere very well for me.  All the stores where I shop stopped carrying the regular size, so I am so happy that Amazon carries these, and for a much better price than I was paying!  Always Dri-liners also makes a Long pantyliner, which is wider and longer.  I use those too when I need more coverage, like for light days of my cycle."
410,414,20070423,B005P0SMW8,5,"April 23, 2007",AKFGW8HE7STY2,Great for Digestion,"I have heartburn troubles from time to time and was looking for an alternative to medication.  I have tried other aloe products and was looking for one I could get for a better price.  I love this stuff.  The taste is almost like water, not strong at all and keeps me free of indigestion, heartburn, etc.  I am not real good a drinking a little everyday, so when I have problems, I will drink half a cup or put it in my water to drink all day.  This product is great and will help to clean your system too."
153,153,20100731,B0029NYQ38,5,"July 31, 2010",AO2AFR6B5GOSW,BEST EVER!,"These are super absorbent, and I\'ve never had a problem with leaking like I have with other types."
352,355,20110915,B004J36GES,4,"September 15, 2011",A199FRO0YFMGED,"Good, but not as good the the ultra thin with wings","I normally use \'Ultra Long/Super with Wings, Unscented Thin Pads\' from the same maker. It fits my relatively active life style and protects well overnight. However the wings against the skin bother me a little.This maxi does not have wings and the pad itself is softer. So this is more comfortable. However the protection is not as good without wings, although it is still very absorbent. The odor-lock is a plus."
101,101,20120328,B0029NYQ1K,5,"March 28, 2012",A3R5HY5P3JETXZ,the best out there,"Amazing! They\'re so soft and feel like memory foam. Other pads feels sticky or plasticy and drive me crazy, but these are the BEST. Only pads ill ever use now. They\'re so thin, yet they absorb so well and stay dry. Worth every penny."
207,207,20111022,B0029NYQB0,5,"October 22, 2011",A3S3VSXEFXBMRC,Great,"Finally I found great scented liners, I was so tired haunting for the scented ones. And there it is! This is a great liner. It stays on the panty, the scent is subtle, it\'s thin, but does the job. I am pleased."
219,220,20100621,B0029NYQCO,5,"June 21, 2010",A2T135XHAH82S4,good product and price from amazon,Good product and price from Amazon (especially with \'subscribe and save\')...Very convenient with delivery...and did I mention much cheaper than in stores???  Very nice service from Amazon!
45,45,20110902,B001LK6QJW,5,"September 2, 2011",A2VZLBO77LM4EX,Brand-loyal to Always\' products,These Always liners are great and well-priced. The liners are individually wrapped so you can keep them discreetly in your purse - or toiletries bag when traveling.
403,407,20080531,B005P0SMW8,5,"May 31, 2008",A2QXMEWCYVS50W,Good Golly George!,"This Aloe Vera is like spring water. It\'s very easy to use and has been very healing.  Our first knowledge of George\'s was a referral from a friend when my husband was undergoing radiation and dealing with the burns to his mouth. Since then I\'ve ordered gift bottles for family and friends also undergoing treatment.  Certainly it\'s not curative, but is soothing and helps deal with the side effects.  I think it\'s a good idea for general use, whether used as a topical or for drinking.  I prefer it cold but it doesn\'t need to be refrigerated. I think it\'s an amazing, easy to use product and highly recommend it for whatever reason."
57,57,20120202,B001LK6XG8,1,"February 2, 2012",A3HRKDM9S54FAO,Hate These!,"The only positive thing I can say about these is they are long.  They are not soft like most pantiliners I\'ve used, but are very stiff.  They are extremely wide.  So wide, in fact, they  tend to curl under along the edges as they are worn.  I ordered through the subscribe and save program. Should have tried them first.  I will definitely be canceling that subscription."
225,226,20120318,B0029NYQEC,3,"March 18, 2012",ARRCMSQU4BX91,great product but bad packaging,as the title: great product; but it\'s pretty inconvenient to use without individual packaging. I\'ll buy again if they improve the packaging.
292,295,20110915,B003CP15AE,5,"September 15, 2011",A2L6QS8SVHT9RG,Recommended for overnight use,"I highly recommend these for overnight or daily use (especially for heavy days), as these thin yet absorbant pads stay in place and works great:  comes in individually wrapped packages (one each), making this perfect to carry in a side pocket in your purse.  These are great to have around: Always is a name brand that speaks for itself in this market, in terms of quality product that works and does what it is supposed to do: this item is reasonably priced and would definitely recommend!"
253,255,20120405,B003CP1590,4,"April 5, 2012",AHUJB9FTS71RE,"No leakage, not uncomfortable","As awkward as it is to review an item like this, I have to say that these are the only pads I will use. Problems I\'ve had with other pads: too long, too short, too thick, not wide enough. These seem to be the right length, thickness, and absorbency. I like that you can buy more than one at a time through Amazon, as it is convenient to just have them shipped as you need them."

I\'m 5\'3\' and 120lbs.  These are longer than all the others (even the other Always overnights in the green and orange package) and are more flared towards the back to provide better coverage.  Perfect for getting a full night\'s sleep without having to worry about waking up and changing.  They are thicker so some people may not like that, but it works for me."
342,345,20110926,B004J36GES,4,"September 26, 2011",A2VX9MWJ8LEIN1,Does what it is supposed to do,"These are thick comfortable pads, prevents leaks and does the job during those uncomfortable days. It provides the security that some people need, but th drawback is that it does not have wings, so making the pads less secure sometimes.  But for some people who don\'t like the wings, these are good, comfortable, secured pads."
217,218,20110423,B0029NYQCO,2,"April 23, 2011",A3MECKA1VPDL65,new formula?,I dont know if the product has been changed or if I just got the wrong thing but I have been using this product for years and the order I recently recieved has been horribly uncomfortable. Normall it absorbs great but this batch does not absorb at all causing me to be itchy.
378,382,20111112,B005P0SMW8,5,"November 12, 2011",A4BRTHMNNVXHU,Great Product,"I tried this product to releave my heartburn symptoms as nothing else seem to work.  After drinking it for about 3 weeks my heartburn was gone.  I have been drinking this for over a year now.  Some days I have mild heartburn but for the most I am heartburn free.  If you have this problem, I would recommend trying it."

350,353,20110915,B004J36GES,5,"September 15, 2011",A2B7BUH8834Y6M,"thin on size, thick on absorption","I\'ve always been paranoid about \'leaking\' in public or ruining upholstered furniture, etc. during that special time. I\'ve been a big fan of Always branded pads since they first came out. Nice channels direct flow to be absorbed before spilling over and they stay in place. I\'ve previously always gotten the thicker \'over night\' and \'extra long\' versions because of my over-the-top leak paranoia... but I gave these thinner pads a go and I did not have any incidents. I\'ve always avoided scented feminine products, because the last thing I\'d want to do  is attract attention to an area that needs no spectators or inquisitors. These pads really are \'lightly scented\' - just pleasant and not the over-powering all-familiar scent that is present in public bathrooms."

My dad has gotten cancer in his esophagus from years and years of untreated acid reflux. I didn\'t want to have the same results as he did. So, after much research, I kept coming back to Aloe Vera Juice. George\'s was recommended for it\'s taste and texture. I\'ve been using it for a month. It took about a good week or so to really kick in, but I haven\'t experienced any heartburn, reflux, etc. I wasn\'t expecting it to work as well as it does. I would recommend this to everyone with any type of digestive issues. It\'s not instantanious, but it is so worth it when it does work. I drink 2 oz in the morning and 2 oz at night. It has the exact same feel, taste and texture as water. I have a real issue with taste and texture and this didn\'t bother me at all!!!! I\'ll keep you posted if there are any changes, good or bad."
125,125,20111023,B0029NYQ2E,1,"October 23, 2011",A28N6SRQ4C22ME,Waste of money.,"I tried this product because I was intrigued by the commercial.  Wish I hadn\'t ... the adhesive doesn\'t stick to anything but itself, so the pad bunches, AND it doesn\'t absorb worth anything.  I ruined the clothes I was wearing for the first time in many years because these things don\'t absorb as quickly or as much as Always Ultra-Thin pads.  Plus, they\'re more expensive than the Ultra-Thins.  Bottom line: don\'t bother."
202,202,20111027,B0029NYQ9W,3,"October 27, 2011",ANPK7LEN4WSFP,"Eh - only so, so","Pros: comfortable, plenty of adhesive so they stay in place, very small package, stuck directly to outside plastic covering, so no additional strip to removeCons: TOO thin, barely absorbent. I need to change them twice as often as other liners. Extra garbage (since they are individually wrapped)I like the idea and the presentation, unfortunately not really doing their job. Going to switch back to regular liners."

She found the pads to be less bulky and still absorb quite a bit.  The only issue she had with them was that the adhesive didn\'t hold up as well as she hoped and the product tended to move around somewhat.  When asked whether she would purchase said product, she replied that she prefers this brand, but not necessarily this particular product."

Product arrived in a timely fashion and as described.  This product, IMHO is the best overnite protection available.  Nothing I\'ve ever used before these worked as well, absorbed as much or was easy on my skin as these. Would buy again and again."
323,326,20120119,B004J36GES,5,"January 19, 2012",A167KPMW1NBZJW,Great Quality,"These are the best Always brand product I have ever used. I never was a big fan of Always pads because of that plastic lining that covered the pads. I quit buying them for many years because of that plastic lining. But thankfully THESE pads do not have that. It\'s a nice soft cottony-like covering that is highly absorbent and comfortable, yet feels DRY! These pads have a desirable thickness level; not too thick, not too thin. Just right. They are very long so they are excellent for people who wear them overnight and sleep on their back (as I do). They wear well through the day, and even during very heavy menstruation, I have never had one of these leak. I have become concerned a few times when they kind of bunched up in the middle, but it did not affect their performance at all. These are really great quality and I definitely recommend them."

I was self-conscious the entire day because I felt that it was bunching up my underwear, and when I put my hand behind me I could feel the indention because the pad was just so long. Besides that, it seemed fine. I just absolutely could not stand the bunching and how incredibly long and high up my butt it went. Totally uncomfortable. Wish I would have asked for a sample before investing in two boxes from Amazon."
171,171,20110930,B0029NYQ6A,5,"September 30, 2011",A2FV5YQV866PVF,Excellent Overnight Protection,"This is a review of a \'feminine product\' so there may be \'too much information\' for some readers.Before I tried this particular overnight pad, I would have to double layer the \'thin\' or \'regular\' thickness overnight pads in order to not bleed through during the night. Heavy and extra heavy pads were never absorbent enough. The similar sized (i.e. extra thick) pads would not stay fitted properly and caused leaks. The thicker pads I tried also twisted around to adhesive side up which was both very uncomfortable and caused them to not absorb correctly, so was also messy. I am concerned about toxic shock syndrome so I do not use tampons. I tried every brand of \'overnight\' or \'extra heavy\' pads out there at the time and none of them were up to it. I found these about three years ago and have not tried another heavy flow overnight pad since.With these Always brand Overnight Extra Heavy Flow with Wings I never have to use more than one at a time. I\'ve never had leaks when using these pads and I don\'t have problems with them twisting around to adhesive side up. If you have extremely heavy menstrual flow then you should try these pads.It is true that they are extremely long and very thick. The pad length is such that some cuts of underwear will be too small (or short) in the back if you place the pad correctly. This causes the pad to overhang or stick out of the back of the underwear. This is remedied easily, but can be inconvenient. If this is something that you cannot stand then you should not get these pads.Regarding price, currently Amazon is offering a two pack for about 12 dollars. I\'ve seen big differences in price depending on where you get them (between 12 -20 for one pack)this is the lowest price I have seen so far (about 6 dollars for one pack)."

Simply the BEST!Perfect size: I do not always have my handbag on me... so the Always Thin liners are so discreet. In my pocket and out of sight. Sometimes I forget that I even have it on me. Hee hee.Perfect for everyday use: These liners are sooo super thin that I never notice its presence. I love them!Thank god that they come in the \'unscented\' liners. All that added \'scent\' or \'perfume\' is so unnecessary.These supersede Carefree liners and the store brand liners.Every female should try them!!!

Excellent coverage and leak protection, especially for plus size ladies. I also highly recommend them for women suffering from urinary incontinence and/or interstitial cystitis for everyday wear. I would think cotton undies would work the best with these and be the most comfortable.  Two could be carried discreetly in a purse, inside a small zippered makeup case. After half a century this is one of very few products that in my opinion are perfectly designed."

I\'ve used them for two months and have found them to be non-obsorbent. They\'re also too slender, except in the back. I can\'t count how many accidents I\'ve had while wearing them. I would never buy them again. I\'m sticking with Always Ultra Thins and the regular thick pad in the blue bag."

If you suffer from accidents just like me (for example the bedsheets have blood where I was laying on because I was dripping from the back of my underwear), then this product is for you. I will almost always suffer from this accident, but because the product was long, it covered almost to the back of my panty preventing this from happening. I can\'t really comment on the odor-lock but from what I can tell, it smell a bit less I would guess. But again, I don\'t go out of my way to check if one pad is smellier after use than another since flows vary every menstrual cycle.This product is good if you are accident-prone (you leak from the back when you are sitting because of a heavy flow)"
91,91,20101206,B0029NYPY8,5,"December 6, 2010",AL77KF4YQVL78,Fresh and Clean,"Always Feminine Wipes are one of my favorite luxuries. Even the softest toilet paper doesn\'t compare to how gently this cleans and refreshes. I prefer Always to other brands because some of the others would dry up and others seemed soggy so, after using it, I had to crouch there for a while to air dry before pulling up my panties. Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel.

They are soft, absorbent, and are superb at keeping me clean and fresh.

Less-prepared co-workers will beg, borrow and (usually) steal them once they discover how well they work.  This brings up the cost per use (for you) up by a whole lot.

I too have fibroids and a major bleeding problem - clots, which are very hard to absorb.  I have to sleep with a towel under me and try to discreetly sit on a folder at work if I go to a meeting, it\'s so embarrassing.  Also with the fibroids and polycystic ovaries I have a questionable cycle and will skip months then bleed for weeks at a time (yes I know I need to just have the surgery lol).  I needed the pads stat so I bought them locally and woke up several times with no leaks for the first time in 10 or so years. I feel like today I can run errands without worrying about my tan leather interior, restaraunt chairs or spotting.  This is major, especially for a person who has had a month long period.  The amazon pricing with super saver shipping offers is a much better deal than my local store so I will be back here to buy in bulk.  I also bought the Always overnight super sonic maxi based on reviews and will try that out and leave a review.Thank you Always, thank you Amazon, and thank you reviewers!**UPDATE**  Back on here to buy more of this product, at a better price than my local store.  Still love them and have referred several friends who were also heavy period sufferers.  We all love them.  Also, try the overnight extra heavy flow with wings!  This pad must be at least 14\' long, great for my needs and especially plus size women.  The overnight feels a tad diaper-ish to wear by day, but still works if you need it.  The fit is great on both, I don\'t experience as much bunching and they stay in place. So glad to have my stress level reduced related to spotting and I don\'t have to wear black clothes every day!"

I thought, what the heck, I\'ll give it a try.I\'m about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, and I now realize that I notice NONE of the beneficial Yin tonifying effects that traditional Aloe Vera Juice gives you.  Pretty much none whatsoever.  This Aloe tastes like distilled water.  Has no taste whatsoever.  A good part of Aloe\'s medicine is in the bitter.  All medicines in nature have a bitter tasting element to them.  Bitter is healing.  When you remove the bitter, I\'m not so sure it\'s healing anymore.I was reading through the testiominals on here, and they all seem stomach related.  Perhaps it has a beneficial effect on stomach woes, but since I don\'t have any, it did nothing for me.

They should remark the packages to be small, medium, and long version.  In addition, the pads themselves are super flimsy to the point where they instantly bunch and become uncomfortable.  The flimsiness makes it so the adhesive doesn\'t stand a chance at your backside.  Worthless!RESEARCHERS, PRODUCT DEVELOPERS, AND MARKETERS AT P&G:  Go back to your former SUPERIOR product line!

I found this to be a huge plus, especially when worn overnight.  No chafing or irritation, even when worn while working out for about an hour.- Reliability: No leaks or staining even with heavy flow.  The channels on the pad help to lock in flow plus I found the pad stays in place very well, especially for a pad without wings.- Thickness: Here\'s where these pads lose some points.  A fellow reviewer compared these to a baby\'s diaper - I agree these are quite thick but willing to accept that for the positive factors above.  For overnight use the thickness of this pad isn\'t too big of a deal, but I wouldn\'t recommend wearing this pad under very tight fitting clothing (then again, maybe tight fitting clothes aren\'t such a good idea for the days you need a super maxi!)"

Although I\'m a loyal Always user, I had never tried their Infinity line of pads - honestly, I didn\'t know if they were that much better than their regular line to spend the extra bucks.Right away, I was shocked when opening the wrapper to see that the pad appears full of holes (over-my-head engineering towards absorbency, I suppose -- or perhaps aerodynamics? Ha!). Anyway, there IS a liner underneath, but it still looks a bit frightening. I bravely wore one, and yes, the absorbency and dryness was slightly better than the current Always products I use. The holes did their job.However, my favorite part of the Infinity pad is the wing design! I never would have thought much about it (wings are wings, I thought), but the Infinity pad has a scalloped \'B\' edge to its wing. I had more successful \'sticking\' of the Infinity\'s wing than I\'ve ever had with a normal curved \'D\' edged wing. Usually the wings (though very important and necessary to me in a pad), cause the most stress and hassle when applying! Part of it sticks, part of it doesn\'t and curls upward, leaving sticky spots exposed. Not comfortable. So, the \'B\' shaped edge of the Infinity pad was a plus!Overall, I would definitely use the Infinity pads again, but probably only if I had a coupon to defray the extra cost. Either way, I trust Always\' products for confident protection!"

I\'ve confirmed this fact, however I\'ve also concluded that it smells like water, has the same consistency as water, transparency and even evaporates and doesn\'t leave any film at all, just like water.

I was staying at my sister\'s for a few days when I got my period unexpectedly, and she doesn\'t use these. So, when I had to use her regular pads, I was in hell for a day and half until I could go buy some of the Infinity pads. But, lesson learned. I stash one or two in every place I can in case of emergencies (ex: travel bags, different purses, cosmetics bag, you name it) so I never have to stress out again. It is just so comfortable, I sometimes forget that I\'m on my period and wearing a pad (leading to a danger of remembering to change).

I\'ve always had a problem with being, shall we say... extra juicy. :) So, pantyliners are a staple item at my house. When it came down to choosing between Always & Carefree, a quick whiff of the package determined the clear winner. Carefree possessed an awful, overpowering floral scent that made me want to gag. It was the same stench that I had detected in many public restrooms, combined with *other* odors I dare not mention. OTOH, Always had a fresh, light, clean scent that was not the least bit cloying. Always is like a gentle breeze, whereas Carefree is comparable to a full-blown F5 tornado... with the lifeless carcasses of a few livestock caught up in the funnel. Always is simply the best choice for any woman/girl who seeks good absorption combined with a *slight* fragrance. The problem with highly-scented pantyliners is that, when combined with bodily fluids, they emit some extremely revolting fumes (exactly what I smelt in the public restrooms). Besides, who wants a pantyliner that will undermine your perfume? Who wants to hear \'Hey, what\'s that smell coming from your crotch\'? This will never be a problem with Always. But, scent factor aside, I also love these because they are thin, stay in place reasonably well (with the exception of profuse sweating), absorb a moderate amount of moisture... and I really dig the light blue wrappers (I hate pink; another reason why I\'m put-off by Carefree). :PConclusion: These pantyliners rule.

So please do NOT think this is only targeted toward girls with extra heavy flow.  If you\'re like me and always get so paranoid about leakage at night that you end up lying stiff straight on your bed and always sleep badly during your period, then THIS IS FOR YOU.I stumbled across this one by accident, as not all stores carry this particular size (at least not a couple of years ago).  Ever since then there is not a single day in my house that I don\'t have a pack of this stored in my cabinet, it\'s THAT essential.As I said before, I tend to sleep really badly during my period because i\'m so paranoid of moving at night and allowing leakage onto my sheets (which are a pain to wash out!)  Let\'s just say my crankiness during that time isn\'t all attributed to hormones!  After I started using this one though, aside from the usual cramps and back soreness, nothing else would affect my sleep.This pad is almost like twice the size of a normal day-time heavy pad, or 1.5x size of the old overnight pad I used to use.  The best thing about this, is that not only is it super long so that it covers all the way up to the top of your butt crack, it also has extra wing in that back area that spreads out and allows for more protection.  If you ever had issues where the old overnight is long enough, but liquid would leak on the side when you sleep on your side, then this will get rid of that problem.It is a huge pad though (my friend, who never used it before, when she saw me buying it she thought it was as big as a diaper x___x ) but I wouldn\'t want any thinner pad (even in the same shape and size) if only because the thinner it is, the less i feel protected.  And no matter what, I always want to be protected from leakage, not to mention being able to sleep better!also i only use this for the first 2-4 days or until the flow gets slow so that leakage won\'t really happen any more.  during the day or during the trailing part of my period, i switch back to regular sized pads."

Always is just the right amount, moist enough to clean and refresh while dry enough that I don\'t have to wait before finishing my transaction.I\'m not sure how much is too much information, but let me just say that the comfort these provide is worth it if you suffer from hemorrhoids. They\'re so miserable to clean with scratchy, sand papery toilet paper whereas with Always they\'re a breeze. I know that Preparation H makes their own wipes specifically for that purpose but they\'re so expensive for the one ingredient that they put on the wipes: witch hazel. It\'s so cheap to buy a bottle of witch hazel and squeeze a dollup onto the Always wipe before using it. I only need to use the witch hazel when they\'re really acting up. Usually the wipe is sufficient.The tub isn\'t too tacky looking and fits the wipes perfectly. It also keeps them from drying out. Once in awhile I\'ll accidentally pull out two wipes from the plastic sleeve, which is like facial tissue nearly impossible to get back in and never worth the effort. I\'ll lay the wipe on top of the pack and it will still be moist the next time I open the tub to use it."

It is long and has wings so you do not worry about any leakage. It is very light and it is designed such that you feel dry ALWAYS.

And they are very absorbent, and they do wick moisture away from your body very quickly. I don\'t have to worry with these.

First of all, I have been a long-time Always pad user, and very happy the wing products.  Thought I would try the Infinity model, to see what the hype was about.  BIG MISTAKE!  The pad LEAKS, LEAKS, runs off the top and bottom (but doesn\'t seem to leak through the pad).  I believe there was another reviewer who writes about a water test, where a significant amount of the fluid ran off rather than absorbing into the pad.  Infinity is definitely not comparable in protection to the Always Wings Super or Overnight variety, which NEVER leaks from any angle.  Second, Infinity feels \'wet\' against the skin, which is absolutely unacceptable when wearing for several hours.  Third, for the cost - get the superior absorbancy pad, the standard wings-style Always super or overnight protection.  I guess if you have very light periods, then the Infinity will work for you.  Anything other than very light - I\'d recommend the Always Wings varieties."

Finally tired of wearing an overnight level absorbancy pad and a tampon just to be on the safe side, I decided to find another option. I saw a package of Always Overnight Extra Heavy Flow Maxi pads at my local Wal-Mart, and I thought it wouldn\'t hurt to try them out. W-o-w. First of all, this is a VERY long pad. It is about the length of two Always Ultra-Thin Overnight pads stuck together, and it pretty much expands from the top of my underwear to the back of them. Another helpful feature is that this pad contains two sets of wings--one in the middle like traditional pads and another set at the back. While, these pads DEFINITELY prevent leaks, I have a few complaints about this product. First of all, I\'ve noticed that when you remove the pad, it leaves a thin adhesive strip on your underwear that is hard to remove. So, though these pads keep you from having accidents, I still do not recommend that you wear your good underwear while using them.  Also, it is pretty hard to descreetly carry these in your purse, as they are VERY large. But other than that, I feel that they are an amazing product. Surprisingly, these pads don\'t feel like a diaper when I am wearing them, so that is a plus. However, I feel that women who are any smaller than a size twelve or fourteen might find them to be quite bulky, so I would take that into consideration. Also, if you are a woman who is already sticking two maximum coverage pads together just to feel comfortable, this maxi pad has about the same effect, so it will not be anything new to you. But overall, I will purchase these in the future."

When I first opened it, I was confused. I\'d never seen anything like it. It was so strangely light and yet didn\'t seem like it should be. The material made me think of memory foam, only super soft textured.With how thin it was at the top, I didn\'t think it would be impressive for my flow (I have endometriosis, so that means I always have to wear overnight or better, maximum protection pads to keep up with my super flow, sometimes in addition to a tampon, which I hate wearing). Well, it worked great and it really felt like I didn\'t have anything on.I decided to actually buy the product this period to see if it was just a fluke and put it to the test immediately with my worst time--overnight on my heaviest night. When even the best pads have failed me in the past.Not a drop off the pad. The wings held and only in one place did it even leave the center of the top (the entire bottom was filled). And I felt DRY. If I hadn\'t seen the bottom, I\'d have thought maybe there was no flow overnight.I tried another today and got that familiar \'overproducing\' feeling that always leads to pad failure. I went to the bathroom, expecting a mess and the pad had contained it completely. It hadn\'t approached any edges. I was shocked and amazed. I\'ve never had a pad work this well, in 15 years of super-heavy periods, that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage.What\'s more, I almost always get irritation on this day in my cycle. Nada. I am SOLD.So, to recap: it held more than any other pad I\'ve seen that wasn\'t designed for postpartum usage. It left NO irritation on a heavy day. It worked overnight on my worst night. And I feel dry--it absorbs faster than anything I\'ve ever worn. I\'ve never felt compelled to review a product as strongly as this before, lol. Probably hormones ;)"

This is more comfortable than the comparable maxis that also make sure you don\'t have accidents.- Odor control is good, barely discernable (if you don\'t notice any odor, it\'s all good!)- Wide, so even without wings you don\'t get accidents.I\'ve had no accidents with these, and they\'re even good when you come home from the hospital after having a baby and don\'t want to use the monster-sized pads they give you."

No it\'s not thin.  It isn\'t supposed to be.The pad is a GREAT 15\' LONG.  Offering more protection where the flow goes which is toward our buttocks than any other on the market.  I for one am tired of connecting two pads to get any semblance of protection.  Even light flow doesn\'t go straight down, not if you have thighs which meet.  Some of you are complaining that its too big, well there are plenty more petite pads on the market if you indeed need a smaller pad but for those with a heavy flow and for women above a size 14 who have a big booty we need to APPLAUD THIS PAD for finally arriving for us.  I don\'t know why the industry didn\'t realize a century ago that you shouldn\'t be trying to make pads the same dimension when women range from 4\'9\' to 6\'7\'.  A 6-7\' long pad doesn\'t even protect the most direct fluid route if you\'re a larger lady. Lying down, flow goes awry even more so and for a pad to actually deserve the title OVERNIGHT it needs to come with a nice old old fashioned belting system (just a little strip folks) and truly be more like 22\' inches long.  We need a pad to reach from tummy to back of your waist if it is to prevent all staining and allow us to go to sleep without worry.  These pads don\'t do that and I wish they did.I still say manufacturers have no idea what a heavy flow is but I\'m afraid these are as good as its gets when it come to holding a lot blood. Good for postpartum.  If you have adenomyosis, fibroids, endometriosis, are in peri-menopause or GOD FORBID ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS, I\'m afraid even this pad will need frequent changing.  Do Diapers work as an alternative?  The answer is \'not so well\' as they are made of textiles meant to absorb a dilute fluid not a thick fluid.  Until Proctor and Gamble gets it right the natural green brand of diapers- TUSHIES in its largest size helps some with overnight woes.  If you are a tiny woman you might even be able to actually get one on completely, unwieldy to use (nothing to hold them on).  Alas they are kind to sensitive skin.Back to these pads...For comfort no one ever beats ALWAYS.  They have made the best \'tops\', the surface that touches your skin, for over 2 decades.  In other words they feel great and do stay dry.  These don\'t have the texture of their new Infinity line but instead have that sort of plastic lace top Always came out with back in the late 70s early 80s. I wish that they applied the Infinity odor control and material to THIS SIZE.  Layer the INFINITY textile over this pad.  That combination of materials I think would be a SMASH HIT!  Listen to MEEEE P&G.A word about those darned wings.  All they do is channel moisture toward your groin and hold it there against your skin to make you chafe.  They never stay in place.  They don\'t spare your pretty panties anything.  Take them away!  I tuck them under [or scissor them off].This pad has an adhesive strip protector sheet on top, and another on its back. I welcome that.  When was the last time you saw a women wash her hands BEFORE entering a stall?  You\'re handling a pad with your paws covered with every bacteria from elevator buttons, escalator rails, filthy knobs, currency, tickets, and other person\'s hands and then putting all those bad particles there.  That TOP protective sheet lets you get the pad on without transferring all that mayhem to your groin. That area needs to be handled as sterile-y (is that a word?) as you handle your eyes but no one seems to ever say that.  I wish pads were marked STERILE and were indeed that pristine.INCONTINENCE, these are useless for that purpose.  Add Always Max Protection Dri Liners.  They are as thin as a sheet of paper.  And as teeny as they are (really short) they do hold liquid and boost the performance of any pad they are added to.  Their adhesive is strong, stronger even than on these full size pads. They do not come with any kind of wrapper.I\'m switching back to Always from Natracare.  Went there to avoid chemicals and because there was a sort of quiet underground buzz abut Always is just not being sterile enough in their manufacturing and indeed causing infections but with heavy use Natracare\'s SUPER is irritating and their Nighttime Extra Long is woefully not up to par but if you want less of a pad than these they just might be right for you.  I\'m hoping P&G is making these in at least a CLEAN environment despite the fact that you never see the term STERILE in a sanitary product description.  I think it ought to be there especially for tampons.I DO RECOMMEND THESE FOR HEAVIER FLOW DAYS but unless your body is neater than mine you\'ll still stain sheets until manufacturers really bring the pad to waist.  That\'s just the simple unattractive truth of the matter.Finally the pads are WHITE, my flash may be making them look pink or purple.SOAP dot com with their great 15-20% off coupons and Amazon are running neck and neck on price.For Natracare the best price I\'ve found is at Lucky Vitamin  The Nighttime Extra Long was $3.45 for 10."

That aside the problem with this pad is that while designedfor heavy flow, it actually is not a good pad to depend upon when you have heavy flow. The fatal flaw is that all liquid hits the pad at a specific spot, but goes under what you can visibly see. So in other words, when you check the panit may seem as though there is only a little bit of fluid. However, once you remove the pad you seethat all of the fluid is kept away from sight under the initial layer of cotton. The reason this isproblematic is that it interfere with your ability to correctly judge when the pad is actually FULL.And if you misjudge that, the pad will overflow!Typically all other pads you can visible see how much fluid is on it  and can easily determine when itneeds to be changed. But with infinity, while it may hold a lot, it\'s to scary to trust. To get an accurate understanding of how full the pad actually is, you need to look at the back. I think thispad is best used for average flow. and heavy flow should be left to any other pads in their line thatdon\'t use this \'hide the fluid\' technology."

The other pads wouldn\'t really absorb everything, making me feel gross and unhygienic. And I\'m not even talking about after leaving the pad on for that long.

But I dreamed of something softer, something that wasn\'t rubbing against me and causing me irritation.  Finally, Always Infinity came along, and I\'ve been thrilled!Infinity Heavy Flow is perfect for  when I\'m having a heavy flow or need prolonged protection at night, when I need my pad to provide me with plenty of absorption.  The wings keep the pad secure, they actually wrap around and stick to my panty and the softness keeps me comfortable.  I like not thinking about my pad.  I also like that the pad is designed to be wider in the back.  I\'ve had experiences where my flow completely missed the pad, due to it being too short.  Length is very important if you\'re sitting or laying down for long periods of time.  Also, this is a good pad if you\'re a plus-sized lady.  What length size you choose also depends on your weight too, not just your flow.Out of the various pads that I\'ve purchased, I find that the Infinity series is a bit more expensive, but it is worth the extra change for the comfort and security.  Always Infinity Regular was my go to pad, but now, since trying out the Infinity Heavy Flow, I think I\'ll start using these for nighttime. A big plus, is that this brand comes in unscented, yea!  I don\'t have to worry about irritation due to deodorants that don\'t mask anything.  If you haven\'t tried this brand, do so, you will notice the comfort, immediately."

Many years ago, I found pads by Always that were geared for women who wear sizes 14 and up -- and have since had difficulty being able to consistently find them.The difference is that the pads for sizes 14 and up are longer and offer more protection. I found that Overnight pads are about the same length, and can be helpful in a pinch. But this review is not about the pads.Over the last few years, I have been fortunate enough to lose some weight, and with it, find myself with a generally lighter flow. Pads can get costly, especially when they are barely used, and I found the Always Pantyliners, which did me decently well.The last time I needed pads and liners, I found myself (newly unemployed) in sticker-shock at the drugstore. Sometimes, I guess we forget just how much the odds and ends cost when we\'re not thinking about money. So I came to Amazon, and in looking for my products, found the Always Pantyliner - made for sizes 14 and up.

It is especially good for those of us who experience a fairly heavy flow and for overnight protection. They have a pleasant, light scent and an \'odor-lock\'.  The \'odor- lock\' seemed to work well and I did not feel like I smelled of a perfumy cover-up either.Overall, I would buy these maxi pads again.  They did a good job!"

It\'s not the bulkiest pad out there but not the thinnest either. I liked the length personally and felt it kept a drier feel to the skin than most pads.Item smell was light and not over powering.  Plus it seemed to help control the smell of contents.Bottomline, this is one of those products that people usually stick with brands they know they\'ve grown to trust from trial and error.  For me, I\'d buy it again on sale but I still prefer my ultra thin maxi pads of a different brand.  I also think pads with wings offer more protection for side leaks."

They are soft, comfortable (even at night), unscented, and they have wings.  The length is just right - as a smaller person, I find the length of some pads too great, so have to pick and choose carefully among brands to find one that fits.  Unscented is also important to me - I hate the perfume used in so many brands - usually it is way too strong and screams to everyone who comes within 10\' of you: \'Period!\'.

They are super thin (like paper), the thinnest I have ever seen.  In my opinion, they are only for protecting you from a tampon leak (I\'m sorry for the visual, but it\'s true) or if you have regular discharge.  The amazing thing is that you can adjust the shape if you want them to be thong style or regular panty liner.  It\'s way better than stashing 2 different types of items in your purse.

My first reaction was that the pad was a lot longer than similar products I\'ve used, but this turned out to be a good thing.  The pad was extremely comfortable to wear, not at all bulky, and the wings did not keep coming unstuck as with similar products.  Absorption was excellent.

These wells increase the total surface area that liquid is in contact with the absorbent material and so the liquid not only passes through the surface layer faster, but it also gets absorbed faster by the inner material.Overall, this product does exactly what it claims to do.  Highly recommended for those prone to sudden heavy flow and those with minor incontinence. Pricey but worth it."

Generally, I go for pads that are long and have wings. These particular pads are not the kind I usually go for but I decided to give them a shot. I was actually pleasantly surprised with these!Let\'s talk about the positives first. I generally can\'t go through a period without ruining at least one pair of underwear. I can say that with these, I didn\'t soil my underwear at all. Not even one drop. Also, I\'ve found that pads that don\'t have wings tend to move around a bit but these stayed firmly in place.Now for a couple of negatives. First, as I said above, I like pads with wings. When I wear pads without wings, I\'m always afraid that the pad is going to shift and I\'m going to bleed right through my pants. Although I didn\'t have a problem with these pads, I wish they had wings just for the peace of mind. Second, I don\'t think the light scent did anything to control the odor.Overall, these work pretty well in absorbing and staying put. Although I generally don\'t go for these kinds of pads, it did what it was supposed to do."

First, I do not like scented pads and this is unscented, which is good. What is bad is that it doesn\'t seem to have any baking soda or odor absorbers. Maybe it does and it\'s just not working, but I\'ve never experienced such a smelly pad in such a quick amount of time. When the menstrual blood hits the air it produces a smell and we all know it. You need something to counteract that smell and these pads seem to do nothing for that. You\'d better be changing these pads half-hourly if you want to avoid the period smell. I would not wear this type of pad outside the home due to my insecurities about the lack of smell protection and the need to change them so frequently (due to smell) which is inconvenient. I\'m very picky about smells. If I can smell it, then others can too - no good."

I was at Target a few weeks ago looking for pads when I noticed that Always Infinity was on sale. Ever since they debuted I had basically avoided them like the plague because they\'re more expensive than Always Ultrathins with wings and I had a sneaking suspicion that the product was more hype than substance. But another customer saw me mulling the purchase over and insisted that I buy it. \'Oh, it holds a lot!\' she gushed (no pun intended). \'Trust me!\'Okay, so I did. I bought a box of \'heavy flow\' Infinity plus another box of Ultrathins for \'back up.\' And thank God I did! These pads have got to be the weirdest and most ineffectual maxis I have ever tried. When I first opened one up, I was horrified. First of all, the \'pad\' isn\'t at all like the cotton pad you would expect from a feminine napkin. The material is some kind of \'compressed material\', very similar in feel, flatness and texture to one of those oldskool white spongy Doctor Scholl\'s inserts. It even had the same type of holes in it (at the front of the pad). Making matters worse, there were some goofy markings in the back of the pad, making it look more like some futuristic landing strip at a spaceport than a maxi pad.And the entire thing was tiny. It was so small I had to double check to make sure which size pad I had gotten. But nope, this was indeed the heavy flow pad I was trying out.At any rate, I tried it out and holy frijoles, the adhesive was so weak, the wings couldn\'t attach properly. So I kept pressing them again and they flopped back out like they went, \'OH, NO SHE DIDN\'T! SHE DID NOT TRY STICKING US TO HER UNDERWEAR!\' By this point, my patience was wearing thin, but I had a box of these and was determined to try them out. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Within an hour I could see that flow was leaking/ rolling past the perimeters of the pad. I decided not to chance the pads as my period went into its heavy flow stage and went with my regular Ultrathin Overnights. Then when my flow went light again, I tried the Infinity again for one night. Woke up the next morning and saw that after pooling in the middle, the very little flow I\'d had hopped, skipped, and rolled past the futuristic spaceport landing strip markings in the back of the pad and then found its \'happy place\' in the back of my underwear. Nice.Needless to say, I wasn\'t happy with these  and will still keep using Ultrathins. There\'s one plus side-- if I experience shoe pain in the future and there are no Dr. Scholl\'s inserts to be had, I can use these instead."

I like them because they hold in place well, they protect my clothing.  They are individually wrapped, which makes them more portable; and they are so lightweight and comfortable, I don\'t even know they are there.  That\'s important, because some brands are stiff and feel a bit like cardboard.  I prefer the unscented variety but scented is fine."

Seriously, though, these pads are the best available right now for those of us who are tired of the monthly hassles of staining sheets while sleeping and pants while sitting for long periods of time.  I\'ve been using Always pads for years now because I found them to be the most comfortable and effective option on the market, but even their overnight pads couldn\'t keep up with my body on heavy days, not to mention the crime scene-style sheet stains that would greet me in the morning if I rolled onto my back while sleeping.  With these, though, I can sleep without fear!  The pad is very long and provides great coverage for the back of the underpants, where blood tends to flow, especially while lying on one\'s back.  If you\'re used to tampons or super-thin pads, I\'m sure one of these will feel like a diaper, but as someone used to needing to wear overnight pads, I find them quite comfortable and not at all bothersome.

These came as a sample in one of those packages. What an excellent marketing ploy. I did not think they could improve Always Ultrathins but they have.COMFORTAlways Infinity are oh so soft, thin and dry. Compared to Ultrathins, Inifinity feels more like tissue paper. They keep me drier than Ultrathins by somehow drawing the moisture away from me. With Ultrathins I feel dry. With these, I feel drier. I feel like I don\'t have any pads on.PROTECTIONI will not buy pads without wings. Always Infinity has double wings. Not sure if the double wings are actually better than single wings, but wings are wings and they do protect the sides of the panties just like the Ultrathin with Wings do.The back of the overnight Infinity is longer and wider than the front of the pad for that leakage that seeps backwards. So far, I have not had any accidents. The Infinity regular size, of course, doesn\'t have this added length in the back. I find the regular size adequate for daytime protection.Always Infinity are the most absorbant pads I\'ve ever used. Don\'t know what technology they have, but he moisture is pulled away from me and locked inside. When I change them, I feel they could still absorb so much more. With Ultrathins, I usually think they are at the end of their life.PROS:+wings+thin+keeps moisture away+most absorbant+soft and comfortable+overnights are longer and wider in backCONS:-NONE! Don\'t know how they\'ll improve these!SUMMARYAt the risk of sounding like I work for the company (I don\'t have any ties, trust me), try these. You\'ll be a convert.UPDATE:  Yes, I\'ve been using these ever since I\'ve been introduced to them.  The different lengths correspond exactly to what I need -- regular, heavy and overnight.  There\'s even a little note on each one telling me which side goes forward.  Still haven\'t found any cons."

307,310,20110902,B003CP15AE,5,"September 2, 2011",ATYUQROTHLNYV,"The best, no question","I don\'t want to get into to all the grody details of my expertise in this topic, and I bet you don\'t want me to either. Trust me: if you need serious protection, look no further. Always Infinity is the best.  The pads absorb quickly, feel dry, and hold a huge amount. They stick well and handle wear and tear (like lots of walking) with no trouble. They\'re pretty thin and easy to carry around.I find this length to be best. The shorter ones sometimes leak, and the longer one is so huge it gets a bit uncomfortable and icky. But the whole Infinity line is great.I wind up reversing the front and back, because that\'s what works for me."
103,103,20120102,B0029NYQ1K,3,"January 2, 2012",A23JALFR65FD5Z,Not that great.,"I normally love always, it is my brand of choice. These pads are way to narrow to protect a size 6/7 underwear. i am not a big person, 135 pounds, but the pad stuffing does not extend to cover both sides of my underwear? It also has a funny smell when opening it. I do bleed heavy but I also wear tampons in conjunction and they still don\'t help with the protection of overflow. I say stick with the normal ones, much better."
284,287,20110920,B003CP15AE,2,"September 20, 2011",A11EXFO14WEJM1,always Infinity pads are mostly useless,My wife tried these and had a number of complaints. She definitely would not recommend them let alone order more.- Not better or more absorbant than regular pads she normally uses- You have to pay special attention to the front and back.- Glue backing paper some times tears off instead of cleanly pealing off - annoying- Definitely not for heavy flow- Relatively expensive
356,359,20110911,B004J36GES,4,"September 11, 2011",AZZ5ASC403N74,A true \'super\' product,"These pads are probably the longest I\'ve ever used.  They are classified as super absorbency, and they fit the bill.  I would recommend using only when maximum protection is needed.  They work very well, but do present a little bulk.  However, you can feel confident while wearing that you are protected.  They don\'t have the side \'wings,\' which is a plus for me, as I don\'t like that in a pad.  Recommended for heavy coverage."
120,120,20111220,B0029NYQ2E,5,"December 20, 2011",A3MB95ZAZ3BTQH,best ones ever,"These are the best pads I have ever used. I used to purchase them at my local costco but they stopped selling these so i turned to amazon, they are still cheaper here than in stores."
122,122,20111109,B0029NYQ2E,5,"November 9, 2011",A38AHVJOFWP1ZX,Very Comfortable!,"I was skeptical (remembering those original plastic Always pads), but I got a free sample of these.  What a difference!  The pad is thin, yet very absorbent.  The wings are perfect, and the material is the softest that I have ever come in contact with. I have many skin allergies, but this product doesn\'t cause a reaction.  I\'m hooked!"
12,12,20120406,B001G7QUYQ,1,"April 6, 2012",A7NI5MXWOLLJX,Always Ultra Long/Super Without Wings,"All I can say is Ultra Long is correct...exactly how big is the woman that\'s supposed to wear those things!!! Even the largest of women would find those things ridiculous, and I\'m not a large woman at all...they\'re almost too big for my underwear, and they don\'t adhere to anything. This is one of the worst Always products I\'ve ever bought."
252,254,20110213,B003CP156I,4,"February 13, 2011",AQUNTTXC0K19Q,best pantiliners ever!,"A lot of pantiliners tend to be cheaply made and not very absorbent, so on summer/humid days it doesn\'t help keeping it dry down there at all.This pantiliner is super absorbent and soft to the skin. It keeps you dry even during intense exercise. And because it\'s so absorbent, when your period ambushes you, you wont suffer from an embarrassing leakage. It could actually hold off until you can get to the restroom to change to a legit pad/tamponThe reason i gave it four stars is that these aren\'t individually wrapped, so you can\'t just toss them in your purse and run. I keep a clean ziplock bag for that.Overall highly recommend!"
255,257,20111226,B003CP1590,5,"December 26, 2011",A3M07Z6CC8VBM6,The Best Protection!,"Love this product! These have the best overall protection, and they\'re not bulky! I\'ve tried other brand names and generic brands...they just don\'t compare. Don\'t waste your time and money on the generic brands that claim they are just as good or better. It\'s worth the extra dollar or two for the good stuff!"

We have used the Always Overnight Maxi pads in her diapers for years now, and she has never had a problem with them-- in other words, they absorb well while keeping her clean and dry."

Lol"
277,280,20110928,B003CP15AE,5,"September 28, 2011",A18FUHNBP90IB4,Great Product,This is a great product to have for very special days. I like the wings that we large enough to attach. The directions of Front was a nice feature. The fact that they have wrap on the pads helps that you can store them in your purse or desk. There are so many product to choose from and this company has taken the extra step.
83,83,20090814,B0029NYPXO,4,"August 14, 2009",A1TRZMZ22NMDZU,Best for Travel,"These are single-pack wipes that provide extra cleansing when dry toilet paper isn\'t enough. They are comparable to other wipes, but as others have noted on reviews, they are quite narrow.  This allows one to get one good front to back swipe if holding the wipe lengthwise over the hand. May need two depending on amount of cleaning desired. I bought these mainly to have a portable wipe for work, when forced to use public restrooms (never know if there will be TP once you get in the stall!), or any other time away from home. 4 stars only because I do not particularly care for the added fragrance, and would prefer an adult \'baby wipe\' that is more gentle for sensitive areas. Also wish they would offer a refillable tub option for home, because I do like the product; however, would like less packaging waste when unnecessary."

They were comfortable, even for someone like me who typically uses thin pads.  I\'m pretty picky when it comes to feminine products, but this is a product I wouldn\'t hesitate to purchase."
