Read if you want to find the new product that is the same ingredients as the old product formula!Pantene is trying to say this Shine Enhance conditioner is like the Old Restorative Time Renewal. IT IS NOT. If you are looking for the old formula then you need to buy the Pantene Pro-V Restore Beautiful Lengths FRIZZ CONTROL CONDITIONER. I had the tube from the old formula and found the ingredients in that and the ingredients in the Frizz Control Conditioner ARE THE SAME. I tried to email and call Pantene but they obviously don\'t know their own products and continue to give inaccurate information.AS FOR THE OLD FORMULA SHAMPOO:If you want the Old formula Restorative Time Renewal Shampoo then you will want to buy the NEW BEAUTIFUL LENGTHS SHINE ENHANCE SHAMPOO.I am trying to help because many of my family members and I used the old formula and were worried when they changed things. I have compared the ingredients and no matter what Pantene customer service tells you....these products I listed are the actual replacements. Try them you will see.OLD REVEIW:One of the best conditioners you will ever use for damaged hair. I am a professional stylist and have not found any line that works like Pantene Restoratives Time Renewal. Pantene has stopped making many of their products. What a shame. They said consumers were confused by all the choices. Call and complain. Their products were superior and did what they claimed. IF IT AIN\'T BROKE DON\'T FIX IT!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don\'t like using serums because they involve combing my hair with my fingers to saturate each strand, leaving it stringy and flat once it dries. Detangling sprays are the way to go. I\'ve used a lot of different brands in the past, and really you can\'t go wrong with many of them. But this one is special because it\'s specifically for my hair type. My hair has never looked so curly before. I wash my hair, spray the detangler lightly (too heavy and your hair will look greasy within a few hours), distribute it with my fingers, and leave it to dry. It turns out perfect every time. Without it my hair is just a frizzy mess.The second ingredient is a silicone called amodimethicone. I\'ve heard some bad things about silicones, but I think people are just paranoid about cheap hair ingredients. I don\'t notice any excessive drying or build-up in my hair, so I\'m not worried about it.The smell is awesome, too.

338,346,20100525,B004IS92L8,2,"May 25, 2010",A3BAOIC7JMCY6R,"Ehhhh, just ok!","This is a normal conditioner that I think a lot of people would use as an everyday addition to there hair maintainance. There is nothing truly special about it. The scent is very \'right off the shelf of the drug-store\'. It smells like every other bottle of pantene to me, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing. It is what it is!The conditioner doesn\'t seem to phase my completely unruly, pin straight, fine yet dense hair. I have the strangest hair. Some days it feels very thick and voluminous and others it feels very flat and light. I want a conditioner that adds a nice density to my fine strands but doesn\'t cause my scalp to get oily after a few hours. This doesn\'t do the trick for me.I am also turned off by the fact that this is NOT sls free. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the cheapest method for a company to get it\'s product lathering or textured a certain way and it is literaly the same stuff they use in car wash soaps and degreasing chemicals for car engines. In the same way as it dissolves the grease on the car engines, sodium lauryl sulfate also dissolves the oils on your skin, which can cause a drying effect, which in turn might cause an overproduction of oils, as is my case. It is also well documented that it denatures skin proteins, which causes not only irritation, but also allows environmental contaminants easier access to the lower, sensitive layers of the skin.Products with SLS are not only dangerous for the skin but they can also effect a person\'s hormones and lead to various forms of cancer. So, in the long run, it is better to invest the five bucks you would pay for a tube of this stuff and get something that is CLEARLY marked SLS-FREE. That said, for those less conscious or interested in the harm that SLS can cause...this conditioner will probably be a staple in your shower. It smells fresh and does it\'s job OK for that everyday-pantene price.It\'s not something I would ever buy or endorse though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A little nickel size dab worked into your hair and let in for 20-60 seconds works well.That seems to leave hair soft and conditioned, without any buildup, etc.  The conditioner does not appear to flatten your hair, which some products that make claims of \'adding volume\' are apt to do.I do notice it giving my hair a little bounce and perhaps a little volume, but nothing out of the norm.

I used Pantene in the past, but I\'ve been using Suave for Men for several years now.  This product produces more lather than the Suave and seems to get my hair cleaner using much less shampoo.  So, while it might cost more per bottle, the value to me is greater with this.When I first started using this, it did seem to make my hair feel more dried out, which might just be because the Suave that I use also has a conditioner in it.  So, I now use a separate conditioner from time to time.  I took away one star for that, but if you already use a separate conditioner, then that\'s not an issue.It really does seem to give my hair more volume.  Perhaps it\'s simply cleaner than it was when I used the Suave, but I tend to think that it\'s doing what it claims to do. The scent is just fine to me, also.  So, I recommend giving it a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m not a nut about my hair and, frankly, it ends up in a pony tail a lot of days. That being said, this is perfectly good conditioner. It doesn\'t seem to weigh my hair down and, the one day I took the time to blow dry it and wear it down, it stayed fairly smooth and looked about as well as it always does. Did this conditioner actually make my hair look or feel \'fuller and thicker\' well, not really, and I didn\'t really expect it to either. Did it smooth and condition my hair? Yeah, and that\'s what I expected it to do. I wouldn\'t pay extra for this conditioner (above regular Pantene prices), but I wouldn\'t hesitate to choose it again either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But thanks to the new Pantene Medium-Thick Hair solutions line, we finally have our own choices in hair care!I have very thick, long hair. I grow it out over several years and then have it all cut off and donate it to Locks-for-Love (an organization which makes human hair wigs for children with medical conditions who have lost their own hair). But just because I donate my hair doesn\'t mean I don\'t also want it to look great while I\'m still using it. :)Like many other people I dye my hair, curl it, flat iron it, style it, blow-dry it, and sometimes just like to put it up in a hair clip. I have always been in need of a shampoo and conditioner that was made for those with thick hair, and Pantene has finally created it!This Pantene Pro-V Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner (and the shampoo from the same line) work wonders for making my hair super soft and manageable. It calms the straggler hairs yet still allows hair to be manageable for styling with curling irons without going flat. It gives hair just a touch of shine, but in no way makes it greasy. The scent is not overpowering in any way, and it makes hair so soft you can brush right through it while soaking wet.This 33.80 oz bottle is HUGE. I had no idea exactly how large it was until it came. This is not the bottle you find on the shelves of your local grocery store or Wal-Mart/Target. This is Sams Club/Costco size. It\'s about as long as a loaf of bread! This bottle is over 2 lbs of conditioner, so even those of us with a lot of hair will find it takes a long while to use it all.* * * This is NOT a line for those with thin or fine hair * * *I always end up seeing posts/reviews from those who say they have thin/fine hair and shampoos/conditioners like this make their hair limp and lifeless. Yes, if you have hair that you would consider \'thin\' or \'fine\', this will just weight it down. This line is made for those who have an abundance of hair and are wanting to get it smooth, soft and under control. Please check out one of the other lines for those hair types. This is not the one your looking for.If your hair is long, thick, poofy, coarse, or any other variation of these, I highly recommend trying the Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions line. It\'s the best line of hair care I have found that offers products for these hair types.

It was suggested that I find a mousse, so I found this one at the store. I put this in my hair while still wet, then blow dry upside down for a bit. Then blow dry with a round brush to get the style I want. I was really impressed how my hairstyle actually kept its shape and body throughout the entire day in dry or damp weather (though it flattens out if it gets rained on), and even when I wake up in the morning. Best of all it isn\'t crusty and doesn\'t make my hair feel heavy or oily. This is my first experience with a mousse hair product, so I can\'t compare it to other brands.

I bought this spray with my daughter in mind. Her hair is often unruly and is pretty curly. I wanted something that I could put in right after her baths so that she didn\'t have a frizzy halo effect. I tried it on her immediately and can\'t say I noticed much difference. The odor is pleasant and the fine mist spray was adequate. It rinsed easily off of my hands, which is a major plus.The real test was my hair. I sprayed it down and just twisted it into several quick twists that I secured with bobby pins. I forgot about it for 2 hours and then removed the pins. Wow. My hair was so curly, more than I\'ve ever achieved even with a curling iron. The gel spray really held them without my hair feeling too crunchy or full of product. I  quickly gave myself a Medusa-style \'do with the curls going straight up off my scalp. I fluffed and frizzed it up. The volume of it was almost scary. Then I thought I\'d really test the gel spray. A few spritzes on my giant bunch of curls and immediately they unfrizzed and were easier to tame without losing all the volume.Ilove how versatile my hair suddenly feels. This gel was really fun to use when I felt the whim to change things up. I think it\'s inspired me to keep trying out something difference, since my hair has been straight and flat year after year. For the price, its definitely worth a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There\'s a certain segment of the population that perceives a certain elegance, an elan, if you will (or if you won\'t), a panache and flair to products named with a bon mot. Pantene... it sounds elegant(though it has no French meaning--not that it matters) and, by the way, it works pretty darn well.That\'s the most important thing here, Pantene \'FIne Hair SOlutions Flat to Volume\' Conditioner does what it says it will do: Add s bit of of volume (or the appearance of volume) by coating your hair strands, and adding sheen by aligning them.  IT reduce tangles, does not have an unpleasant smell, and basically has a reasonable price. Yes, you can go cheaper, and you might as well give those a try.While we\'re talking about language, what\'s with the name \'Flat to Volume\' --is it an awkward shorthand for \'Your hair looks flat, see, and this stuff will give it VOLUME. Therefore, Flat to Volume!\'  IT might annoy you for a few seconds, or perhaps this is Pantenese, and I\'m the one who should know better.Pantene comes out of the bottle fairly thick, so use just a little. Spread it around your hair, and it becomes much less viscous. I\'d recommend also that you rinse thoroughly.  I thought I detected a slight allergic reaction on my part (some itching) compared to not using it, but this is a tenuous connection and may have nothing to do with the product.  However, like all beauty/cosmetic products, it\'s probably better to buy ONE of these first to determine whether you have any adverse reactions.  Bottom line: I\'d buy it again, but it didn\'t blow me away either.  If you\'re not happy with the conditioner you use now and you tend towards the thin hair end of the follicle spectrum, then this is certainly worth a try. Bon chance a vous!

But the past few months I had given up on wearing my hair curly because I was tired of all the bad products out there. They either did nothing to combat my frizzies, left my curls looking thin and \'scrunchy\', or left my hair just totally flat, which is quite the accomplishment because I have very long, thick hair with a lot of natural volume.My prayers are answered with the Pantene Pro-V Curly line!! I usually always try & use organic products on my hair (without sulfites and stuff) so I was hesitant to try this. But I\'m so glad I did.

After my shower i wrapped my hair in a towel on top of my head, after about 10 minutes i undid the towel, then gently (i try not to toussle my hair around too much when its wet because i feel as if this makes it more frizzy) ran a moderate amount of mouse throughout my curls, separating them and making sure i coat all my hair.I let my hair air dry and occasionally twisted a few curls here and there with my finger and added a teenny tiny bit more mousse here and there where i thought it was starting to frizz up. My curls look extra curly, lots of volume, not crunchy at all & it helped with the frizz A LOT too. I used the hairspray VERY sparingly, i feel as if this is the only product in the line that may cause any sort of \'crunchiness\', so be careful with that one. Just don\'t use too much.I will use this line whenever i want to wear my hair curly (which will now be more often) but I will stick with my organic shampoos for all other times.Also, ***side note***, I was due for a trim when i tried this product so the ends of my hair were very frayed, and anyone with curly hair knows that just makes your hair look even MORE frizzy. So i used a dollop of \'nexxus pro mend  leave in treatment creme\' on my ends and...AMAZING! I know it doesn\'t really \'mend\' my split ends, but it does temporarily bind them together making them practically invisible (until i wash my hair again) and cuts down on almost all the frizz, so my ends look awesome. So i suggest adding that to your curly hair routine if you have split ends",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

227,231,20100613,B003JA3KDW,3,"June 13, 2010",A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,"OK conditioner, weird curling results","My hair has a natural wave that is easily coaxed into curls with a little gel or mousse and allowing to air dry.  The Pantene curly hair series conditioner doesn\'t condition my dry ends as much as other conditioners do, but at the same time it didn\'t make it worse as some products have, so I can\'t really complain.The conditioner is quite clingy in the shower, meaning it\'s really hard to massage into the entire length of my hair.  It wants to say where it was first applied, which is quite odd.  It rinses clean and smells nice.  I don\'t use more of it than I do any of Pantene\'s conditioners.When I use the conditioner and just let my hair air dry without product, my hair becomes what I suppose could be called \'curlier.\'  In fact, it\'s as though my hair gets separated out into a series of almost ringlet-like strands.  However, it\'s frizzy, and when I comb through my hair it loses those ringlet things and just becomes a fuzzy bunch of waves.  It is easily tamed by some (other brand) of mild leave-in conditioner and/or spray curl enhancer.  In comparison, I have some Pantene conditioner for dyed hair from their previous series and, while it doesn\'t leave my hair in those ringlet-curls, it also doesn\'t leave my hair frizzy either.When I use the curly hair series conditioner with product in my hair and let it air dry, the hair avoids the ringlet look and turns into what\'s more of an 80s perm, but not frizzy at all.  Combing it out produces a pretty nice series of controlled waves, but there is a tendency to frizz during the day.  Again comparing it with the Pantene conditioner for color-treated hair, it works about the same but provides more controlled waves than the color-treated version does.In all, I personally wouldn\'t buy the curl series conditioner.  Actually, I\'m not sure if I\'d buy any of their product as their current line exists.  See, I\'ve used many Pantene products over the years, and years ago I used Pantene curl products and liked them.  The conditioner was much better than this version; however, Pantene reformulates and repackages their products every few years, which not only means you lose the type of Pantene you liked to use, but also that it\'s hard to stick with Pantene as an overall brand.  I did (and do) continue to use Pantene, always buying whatever series had stronger conditioning than their ever-present Classic Care line.However, with this new series there is no high-conditioning product.  Right now they have Classic Care as they always do, plus curly, color treated, fine hair, medium-thick hair... well, my hair is 3 out of those 4, which do I choose?  I suspect everyone\'s hair falls into more than one of Pantene\'s categories.  It\'s possible there isn\'t a product in their current line-up for me to use, which means I\'ll have to wait 2-3 years until they reformulate yet again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I tried this shampoo out because I\'ve had some good experiences with Pantene in the past and thought there was a chance that it might buoy my hair up at least just a tad!It certainly smells very nice and cleans my hair very well.  Some shampoos are less effective for me to the extent that I have to wash my hair more than once a day if I don\'t want it to become very oily; this shampoo definitely kept that from happening.  It also doesn\'t seem to leave any residue or buildup.On the other hand, I definitely didn\'t leave the house with suddenly voluminous hair. It was its flat, shiny, normal self.  But, like the guy who kept asking God if he could win the lottery and never bought a ticket, I\'m guessing you\'d have to meet the product half way to get results.

I was looking for a new conditioner because the salon brand I loved, despite paying almost $50 for it, changed its formulation.  To my surprise, Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions is the one.  It smells nice going on, but avoids having a heavy, cloying scent that hangs around all day.  I can use a tiny amount (although that\'s par for the course with my hair).  Best of all, it does for my hair just what it says it will:  Allows my hair to maintain volume and hold its style.

My hair varies from one to six inches in length and after using the Pro-v conditioner; it was noticeably soft and manageable. No frizz to speak of. My wife\'s longer tresses like it too. She has wavy hair and her use of it produced similar results -- very soft, lots of body, no frizz. She was pleased.

I found myself wanting to constantly itch. I had to restrain myself from doing so in public.I guess if you really can\'t afford the more expensive stuff you could give patene a try. If I were you though, I would consider forking over just a bit more dough for something better. I decided to give Giovanni Max Volume a try and that stuff works great. My hair has volume and is incredibly soft and silky. Of course I got it on clearance at TJ Maxx so I\'m not sure if it\'s still in most stores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The color of the conditioner is white. After washing my hair with a bar of DIAL SOAP, as I have done every day for the past 25 years, I used this conditioner according to the instructions.

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B.

33,33,20100902,B001F51V3E,4,"September 2, 2010",AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,Light Conditioning and Neutral pH,"I like Pantene shampoo.  One of the reasons is that it\'s strong enough to really clean your hair but not so harsh that it dries your scalp.  In the past I\'ve had highlights and I\'ve used this shampoo without any detrimental effects.  Granted, if I colored my hair again I would use a shampoo made especially for treated hair (probably Pantene, since I\'m a creature of habit).As far as conditioning I have to say that it is very light.  For my daughter, for example, who has fine, straight, but remarkably easy-to-tangle hair, we still have to use a detangler.  So it\'s a lighter conditioning effect than if you used a separate conditioner.  Personally I like this because it doesn\'t \'weigh\' down my hair, just controls the humidity frizzes.OVERALL, a gentle, thorough cleanser with gentle conditioning that makes combing after shampooing easier.Pam T~mom-blogger",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s a good conditioner, but is it any better for my hair than say any other Pantene conditioner on the market?  I\'d have to say no.  I can\'t tell the difference between using this formulation or the regular Pantene.  My hair still requires me to put anti-frizz products in it, and it doesn\'t look any different after using this conditioner than another kind quite honestly.But that aside, the reason to buy this particular product is that this DOES leave hair soft and able to be combed right out of the shower (unlike some cheap conditioners) so that is why I give it 4 stars.  I don\'t believe there is any conditioner on the market currently that can truly manage the frizz of curly hair, and probably there never will be.  You will always have to follow your same routine and use additional product after your shower if you need to control the frizz inherent in curly hair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will add a comment to this review if I have a later reaction or other problems.It has made my straight, flat hair look somewhat fluffy; it appears to have more body. Note that this was achieved by merely shampooing, followed by partial drying with a towel; no blow dryer used.The shampoo seems somewhat concentrated, not watered down.  It left my hair and scalp feeling thoroughly clean.  Unlike some shampoos, it has not left my hair feeling as if it were coated with anything greasy or heavy; just clean hair.While shampooing, I noticed only a very subtle scent, that was not specifically feminine nor masculine. It did not leave a noticeable scent my the hair.  A day later, if I bury my sensitive nose in my hair, I can just barely detect a vaguely plant-like scent, gender-neutral.P.S.

Its texture isn\'t as thick as some others, such as Neutrogena\'s Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner (which is an excellent product), but it does its job. The product claims to \'moisturize, control frizz and define curls,\' and while the results aren\'t miraculous, one can expect the hair to feel and look smoother, moisturized, and less frizzy after conditioning with this product (compared with no conditioner). It seems to be my experience that, if I blow-dry my hair completely after conditioning with this product, the hair looks somewhat smooth, but full and light at the same time (not weighed down). However, if you\'d like some \'defined curls,\' you might want to air-dry your hair a little rather than blow-drying it completely. No matter what, if you have coarse fly-aways like mine, some other products may still be needed for a more \'polished\' look (hair gel, serum, or the like).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new formula is much gentler. It has a gel-like consistency, which won\'t weigh hair down or make it oily as a creamy formula would. This shampoo made my hair very, very clean. So clean, in fact, that I could probably drop back to shampooing it every other day instead of every day as I normally would. I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick.As for volumizing properties, my hair didn\'t go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it\'s making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer.The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day.

I did not notice any significant difference from this shampoo as opposed to any other.  Obviously, super clean hair has more volume and bounce than hair not in its first freshness.  I did also try it with a sample size of the conditioner and root lift and must say that the volume held, but again not significantly more so than when I use other light conditioners and root lift.

The matching shampoo was a terrible disappointment however (leaving my hair feeling unclean and coated in a non-slippery way) -- so I tried this conditioner with several other shampoos (both Pantene and non-Pantene sorts).  The best results came after  something like Pantene\'s old Ice Shine shampoo -- though still, only average smoothing and mild taming of my locks, which definitely felt over-coated even after a thorough rinsing.I second what an earlier reviewer said about silicone -- it\'s a shortcut for curly hair that seems to pay you back later in buildup and less-than-satisfactory results in the long run, and it\'s disappointing to find it in this product.I wouldn\'t go out of my way to recommend this conditioner, though I\'ll keep it on hand to use when I\'m out of everything else!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first thing I look for is a totally clear shampoo, because if you can see through it, it\'s not going to weigh down your fine hair, and this Pantene Pro-v is perfectly crystal clear. It has a lovely, very faint light citrus smell, which I like, as I don\'t like shampoo smells to clash with my favorite fragrances. It cleans really well and leaves your fine hair full of body and lift, which is exactly what a great fine hair shampoo should do.The main difference I noticed between my shampoo and this Pantene Pro-v is that Pantene Pro-v cleans really well, as in thoroughly super clean, leaving my hair much fuller with absolutely nothing weighing it down. When your hair is that clean, it\'s very important to use a good conditioner to replace lost moisture. Fine hair needs a very special type of conditioner that will not weigh hair down and flatten it, and the best conditioner I have ever found is one that rinses out minutes after it is put on after shampooing.This is a lovely light scented shampoo that cleans extremely well and leaves your fine hair feeling light, full and bouncy.

I was very excited to see a new Pantene product. Since the 1970s (?) I have found this line of shampoos and conditioners not only gives me volume that looks like I have double the hair I actually have (you should see it tonight), but also improves the health of my hair, preventing and seemingly repairing breakage and split ends. I used to be plagued with split ends and now they are a thing of the past. I like this volumizing product because it enables me to do braids, thick ponytails and upswept styles with various accessories. My hair is also totally straight, so this product and other Pantene products have eliminated the need for a body perm. I will probably buy the product again. The only thing that has always bothered me is that Procter and Gamble insists on animal testing and I have six recued pet rats (often they are lab rats). I really wish they would stop this as their products are good and Pantene products are some of the best on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past, when I haven\'t, I\'ve had the same problems mentioned in previous reviews. It\'s a LIGHT detangler, not a miracle product if your hair is typically a tangled mess in the morning.

From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers\' preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...well. Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers. \'Flat\' indeed!!I will now have to stock up on my regular Volume favorites at premium prices from elsewhere and try and find something else that works when that runs out.
