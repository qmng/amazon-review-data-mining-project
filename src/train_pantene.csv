I didn\'t realize this was the Curly formula when I ordered it.  My last gem was Sunsilk Volume, which has been reformulated (probably not a word) and my hair now feels like straw.  I gave this a shot and was pleasantly surprised.  It left my hair feeling like it was actually conditioned; silky.  While I have seen this on the shelves for 5.99, it\'s frequently on sale for 3.99, and I\'ll probably be purchasing again. "

This product used to be called something like Frizz control smoothing balm and was packaged differently.  I am so glad Pantene did not take it off the market, but simply changed the name and packaging.  This balm is one of the few products I have found that actually works and I am one of those people that has tried almost every anti-frizz product out there.  It even works better than most expensive products.  It also blends in well, so you aren\'t left with sticky or wet feeling hair. "

I was disappointed when it arrived and it was Curls to Straight.  I hadn\'t realized I wanted Dry to Moisturized Conditioner, they are both part of the Curly Hair series.I was so frustrated with the packaging and label which I thought was misleading, I called Pantene.  I told them about my confusion (and that I obviously didn\'t read the entire name) and they actually sent me coupons to buy the correct product.I have curly hair & I want to have curly hair but I was out of conditioner so I used the Curls to Straight.  I thought my hair was untangled and smooth just like I like it.  I did not find that it straightened my curls.  Maybe they expect you to use it with other products and try to straighten your hair (like blow dry it straight)?  I used it for a couple of weeks before the coupons arrived and I replaced it with the other product.  By the end of the 2 weeks my hair did seem more relaxed but I\'m not sure if part of that is the winter dry weather (my hair is much curlier in the humid weather).I appreciate the customer service of the company especially since it was my mistake.

Read if you want to find the new product that is the same ingredients as the old product formula!Pantene is trying to say this Shine Enhance conditioner is like the Old Restorative Time Renewal. IT IS NOT. If you are looking for the old formula then you need to buy the Pantene Pro-V Restore Beautiful Lengths FRIZZ CONTROL CONDITIONER. I had the tube from the old formula and found the ingredients in that and the ingredients in the Frizz Control Conditioner ARE THE SAME. I tried to email and call Pantene but they obviously don\'t know their own products and continue to give inaccurate information.AS FOR THE OLD FORMULA SHAMPOO:If you want the Old formula Restorative Time Renewal Shampoo then you will want to buy the NEW BEAUTIFUL LENGTHS SHINE ENHANCE SHAMPOO.I am trying to help because many of my family members and I used the old formula and were worried when they changed things. I have compared the ingredients and no matter what Pantene customer service tells you....these products I listed are the actual replacements. Try them you will see.OLD REVEIW:One of the best conditioners you will ever use for damaged hair. I am a professional stylist and have not found any line that works like Pantene Restoratives Time Renewal. Pantene has stopped making many of their products. What a shame. They said consumers were confused by all the choices. Call and complain. Their products were superior and did what they claimed. IF IT AIN\'T BROKE DON\'T FIX IT!

I have tried sooooo many products, many expensive and many non-expensive.  I have very fine hair and most products make my hair feel yucky.  This is the first spray gel product that I have tried that has not made my hair feel heavy and hard.  It still feels soft and manageable.  Other products will clock out after a few hours or not work at all.  This gel is also lightweight enough that I can use it everyday and not have a lot of product buildup!  Thank you Pantene!Love!! "
235,239,20100606,B003JA3KDW,4,"June 6, 2010",A3S96B2GBP04N2,Too much perfume but satisfied with it\'s performance,"Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works as advertised. It\'s a nice thick conditioner which controls the frizz and helps to detangle your hair in the shower.My hair type is thick and coarse and naturally wavy and tends to frizz. I usually use a leave in glossing cream after I wash my hair to detangle my hair without breakage and to keep my hair from becoming a frizzy mess.I live in Texas and right now the summer is coming on and it\'s hot and humid so it\'s the perfect recipe for my hair to frizz.The first time I used this conditioner was after swimming and there was no way I could run a comb through my hair without help.  After shampooing with my normal shampoo I was able to detangle my hair using the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner in the shower with no breakage. The conditioner is thick so it coats my hair well while in the shower but it doesn\'t feel as if the conditioner rinses completely out of the hair.However after stepping out of the shower and toweling off the conditioning results weren\'t there and I still felt as I needed something to help comb my wet hair.I believe the reason for this is, is because of one of the ingredients used in this conditioner called \'Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\'.  Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone is a silicone which is used to coat the hair and is not water soluable so it creates the \'conditioning\' feel you feel when in the shower while the water is pouring over your head but once you step out of the shower it doesn\'t feel the same because it leaves a film behind which doesn\'t allow the hair to slide easily between each other.On the other hand the \'film\' Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone leaves behind is suppose to help control frizz which so far it has done well for me.I have used other Pantene daily conditioners before in the past and unless it was a treatment conditioner such as Pantene\'s \'Deep Fortifying\' conditioners then Pantene\'s daily conditioners are usually rather thin and never worked very well .If you have used Pantene\'s treatment conditioners then you have a general idea of the consistency and results of the Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner.The one thing I really did not like is the smell of this conditioner.  The perfume is much stronger with this product than with Pantene\'s other products. It\'s not over whelming but noticeable stronger than another of Pantene\'s product I currently own.I am sensitive to scents so what I feel is too much isn\'t always the case for someone else.  If you are someone who doesn\'t like a lot of perfume you may want to give this product a whiff the next time you are at a grocery store before you purchase it here from Amazon.I do not know if I will continue using this product. This is my third wash using this conditioner and so far I am happy with the results but I\'m sensitive to products which contain sulfates and with anything that leaves a film behind a strong cleaner is definitely needed to help remove build up between uses. If I notice that my non-sulfate shampoos are sufficient in cleaning between conditioning with this  than I\'ll probably stick to using this otherwise I\'ll probably return to my normal routine.In conclusion I give it a 4 stars because I believe that Pantene\'s Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works well for those battling frizzy hair and after my hair dried it was extremely soft but I don\'t care for the perfume because I feel it\'s too strong.I like to give a Pro and Con breakdown for each of my reviews so here is the list for this one.Pros1. Controls Frizz2. Thick conditioner which helps it stay put where neededCon1.  I don\'t care for the heavy perfume smell "

95,97,20110601,B003EGYDEQ,5,"June 1, 2011",A19Y3RIK8GJGQ5,My favorite detangler...,"A few words of caution though, you have to brush out the spray entirely, or it will leave behind a \'weird\' feeling. -Meaning don\'t spray AFTER you brush it. Thoroughly brush your hair, and use conservatively. I\'ve used this on my hair, following the suggestions, with no problems. In the past, when I haven\'t, I\'ve had the same problems mentioned in previous reviews. It\'s a LIGHT detangler, not a miracle product if your hair is typically a tangled mess in the morning. I still use this on my daughter\'s morning tangle-prone hair with good results. It also leaves behind a hint of Pantene scent, which is a nice change over the usually \'fruity\' smell of detanglers. "
82,84,20110203,B003EGSA3Q,5,"February 3, 2011",A2ICO9FHF7WATR,my favorite,I have fine curly hair and live in a very humid climate. Conditioners for curly hair usually aren\'t enough for me. This works the best for me of all the conditioners I have ever tried. Pantene changed the name a couple of years ago from Always Smooth to Medium-Thick but it\'s the same stuff and I hope they never try to tweak the recipe because I think it\'s perfectly formulated. It\'s so heavy it will make my curly hair almost lay straight which I love since I hate to use heat to style my hair. The fragrance is gone for me once I have rinsed it out and it is not unbearable like the other reviewer would suggest.

249,256,20101130,B003PAINPG,5,"November 30, 2010",A3LMKOY01HEE9A,Very Satisfied customer,I love Pantene Pro-V Relaxed and Natural for Women of Color Shampoo.  This is great shampoo with lots of moisturizers.  Many African American women\'s hair tend to be dry.  This works great for dryness.  It makes my hair feel very soft and manageable.  Thank you Pantene for this shampoo.  I will buy this product again. 
208,210,20100623,B003JA3KDW,4,"June 23, 2010",AZFHSPEZUPGD2,"Works well on fine, curly hair","This conditioner is working very well for my pre-teen daughter\'s long, fine, corkscrew-curly hair.  She requires a fairly \'slippery\' conditioner to help her get the tangles out, and it must have substantial moisturizing capability to avoid the frizzies.  This conditioner does both well.But we have used other Pantene conditioners for dry hair in the past, and they have also worked pretty well.  To tell the truth, I don\'t see much difference if she uses the \'Curly\' conditioner vs a regular Pantene moisturizing conditioner.  I would definately buy this product again, since it does work well for her, but only if the price is comparable to other Pantene conditioners.  I wouldn\'t pay extra for the \'curly\' on the label. "
3,3,20111019,B0014D08PO,5,"October 19, 2011",A39MEL9G0XZO8X,Fixes damaged hair wonderfully,I called pantene to complain that I couldn\'t find my favorite conditioner and they said that this was the same formula. So if you liked Pantene pro-v time renewal.. This is it!! This repairs 2yrs damage in 2 months!! 
383,392,20100614,B004ISB3AG,4,"June 14, 2010",A3G7BEJJCPD6DS,Same Old,"I\'ve used Pantene for a while and although this is supposed to be a re-formulated version, I really could not tell much of a difference. I liked the smell and my hair felt clean as usual, but other than the nifty new bottle, it was the same experience. I\'m giving it 4 stars since the shampoo does what it promises to do and works well just like the old version. "
190,192,20100923,B003JA3KDW,3,"September 23, 2010",AOP41SVJTXNBN,Average results at best,"I often turn to Pantene products when I can\'t stand (or can\'t afford) shelling out the $$ for salon products.  My hair is wavy to curly, very thick, and can feel quite coarse with the wrong weather or product.  I often suffer from frizziness or a lack of definition in my curls.This Pantene conditioner was average at best -- it smells nice, goes on easily, but leaves my hair feeling very coated -- in a slippery way, however, which is often nice with difficult to manage curly hair.  The matching shampoo was a terrible disappointment however (leaving my hair feeling unclean and coated in a non-slippery way) -- so I tried this conditioner with several other shampoos (both Pantene and non-Pantene sorts).  The best results came after  something like Pantene\'s old Ice Shine shampoo -- though still, only average smoothing and mild taming of my locks, which definitely felt over-coated even after a thorough rinsing.I second what an earlier reviewer said about silicone -- it\'s a shortcut for curly hair that seems to pay you back later in buildup and less-than-satisfactory results in the long run, and it\'s disappointing to find it in this product.I wouldn\'t go out of my way to recommend this conditioner, though I\'ll keep it on hand to use when I\'m out of everything else!

If you buy it here you can subscribe and save which helps.  A good value.  The entire family can use it, smells good but doesn\'t attract insects.  Love it! "
316,324,20100614,B004IS92L8,5,"June 14, 2010",A3T4OHEAHOJ700,Excellent for fine hair!,"Pantene typically has high quality products, and the Pro-v Fine Hair Flat To Volume conditioner is no exception.The product does not feel overly greasy, not does it have too water a consistency, as do some cheaper conditioners.  A little nickel size dab worked into your hair and let in for 20-60 seconds works well.That seems to leave hair soft and conditioned, without any buildup, etc.  The conditioner does not appear to flatten your hair, which some products that make claims of \'adding volume\' are apt to do.I do notice it giving my hair a little bounce and perhaps a little volume, but nothing out of the norm.  Its a conditioner and does what you\'d expect a good conditioner to do.As far as scent, it has a pleasant fragrance, a bit flowery but not overpowering at all. "

394,403,20100605,B004ISB3AG,5,"June 5, 2010",A3QNQQKJTL76H0,An excellent shampoo for those with a sensitive scalp,"I\'ve been using this shampoo every day for a week and am very impressed with it. For an unassuming non-specialty brand, it delivers excellent cleaning properties and better performance than many of the specialized brands I\'ve tried. My scalp is very sensitive and I have a hard time finding shampoo that does not leave my scalp dry and itchy. This Pantene Pro-V leaves my hair feeling clean and does not dry out my scalp like many other brands, even ones that claim to be moisturizing.It is clear with no FD&C dyes, pleasantly-scented (floral) and produces a thick, sastifying lather. I am a male with short-medium length hair. A dollop the size of a quarter is all I needed to work into a rich foam that covers my entire head. One bottle should last me more than 6 months at this rate, making this product an excellent value. Highly recommended. "
355,363,20100831,B004ISB3AG,4,"August 31, 2010",AQM0K7MBBT4AY,Decent shampoo.,"This shampoo smells good, gets your hair clean, etc. I used it for a little in order to review for Vine, and found it comparable to any other Pantene Pro-V product (I use all kinds of shampoo... generally just buy what\'s cheap at the time).Because I already have super-thick hair, I decided to give this shampoo to a female friend of mine with fine hair so she could try it out. She seemed happy with it -- no complaints, no raving about her sudden boost in volume either.One of the selling points of this shampoo is a focus on removing oils in the hair, which weigh it down. It\'d probably pay off to make sure you\'re conditioning after using this shampoo, even if you have relatively oily hair (as I do). You\'d be surprised how quick \'volume\' can turn into \'frizz\' if you let your hair dry out. I\'m a guy and don\'t really pay much attention to my hair, but even I know that.Right now this shampoo is going for around thirty bucks for a pack of 6 bottles. Not a steal, but not a ripoff either. Decent price for decent shampoo. "

Product Contains Heavy Perfume Scent.,"I am not a Pantene product user, however, I use a conditioner every day.  I was pleased with the results of the Pantene conditioner on my hair, but wish that Pantene didn\'t put so much perfume into this product.This Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Flat to Volume conditioner gives my layered, shoulder length hair a nice shine.  It doesn\'t leave a noticeable residue, so my hair also feels bouncy and light.The only negative is the conditioner\'s heavy perfume scent. The perfume scent is very strong out of the bottle, and lasts the entire day on my hair.  Some might consider this a nice thing, but for those who are scent sensitive, the heavy perfume scent is too much.  It is not a necessary component of the product, so I personally wish Pantene would make a non-scented version.4 stars because of the heavy perfume scent. It is so strong that I will not be a repeat user. "

It really did not matter on the brand: Paul Mitchell, Redkin, Matrix, Aveda or Nexxus, the results were all pretty disappointing, as all products delivered similar, unsatisfactory results.I never tried ANY Pantene products, although my husband has used their shampoo and conditioner for years.  When I finally tried Pro-V Fine Hair shampoo, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, my hair is still fine, but it feels and looks fuller for longer than it did after using other products. My hair is color treated, and I think my hair look smoother and feels softer as well.The shampoo has a nice, but not overpowering smell, and the price is very reasonable compared to salon brand products. There are always coupons for Pantene products in the newspapers as well for additional savings.  If you are looking to try something new for your limp or fine hair, this product is worth a try.

I chose Pantene because of the price per ounce and its claim to preserve color.  It develops a really nice lather, and a very light smell that does not linger long after showering/bathing.  I have not experienced any back acne that can occur (and has occurred for me) with different shampoos and conditioners.I had my hair colored before using this shampoo, and noticed every time I would wash my hair it looked like I was rinsing freshly colored hair!  Thus spurring me to look into wash my hair with some form of color protecting shampoo/conditioner.  I started using this product right after I got my hair relaxed and colored (first time ever trying to relax my loose curls), so I was extra concerned about damaged/dry hair.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again, as it has been just under 2 months, and I am now starting to notice the fading of color and my roots!  I have my hair colored 4 shades lighter than my natural color, with 5 shades and 3 shades lighter of highlights.  There was minimum hair breakage and loss after the span of these two months, and my relaxer is still going strong!I hope this helps for any other colored heads out there!  :) "

It is easy on the senses -- smells great, smooth, and not a lot of mess.  I put it in my hair after shampooing at the beginning of my shower -- then kept it on until I was done -- probably about five to ten minutes.

I am very happy with this product.Update:  After 2 weeks of using this I find I actually love it!  My hair stays straight and styled all day, and even the next day (I was running late one day and didn\'t have time to wash my hair before work and the style stayed through my work shift) I also forgot my jacket the other day while shopping and had to walk to and from the car in the rain several times and my hair didn\'t frizz or curl up.

This Pantene Pro-v Fine conditioner made the tangles go away easily.I left the conditioner in my hair for about 3 minutes after washing and then rinsed it out with warm water.  My hair felt softer right away.  After drying, it was easy to style either using a curling iron or just blowing dry.  The conditioner had a nice light fragrance that wasn\'t overpowering.

33,33,20100902,B001F51V3E,4,"September 2, 2010",AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,Light Conditioning and Neutral pH,"I like Pantene shampoo.  One of the reasons is that it\'s strong enough to really clean your hair but not so harsh that it dries your scalp.  In the past I\'ve had highlights and I\'ve used this shampoo without any detrimental effects.  Granted, if I colored my hair again I would use a shampoo made especially for treated hair (probably Pantene, since I\'m a creature of habit).As far as conditioning I have to say that it is very light.  For my daughter, for example, who has fine, straight, but remarkably easy-to-tangle hair, we still have to use a detangler.  So it\'s a lighter conditioning effect than if you used a separate conditioner.  Personally I like this because it doesn\'t \'weigh\' down my hair, just controls the humidity frizzes.OVERALL, a gentle, thorough cleanser with gentle conditioning that makes combing after shampooing easier.Pam T~mom-blogger "

There are definitely both better and worse shampoos out there, depending on what you spend.We both agreed that the most annoying part of it was the packaging.  The cap is hard to open, especially with wet hands.  The cap is also a weird recessed design that collects water, but then has drainage holes in it.

I run into this a lot and am always on the lookout for products that claim to help.  I was looking for a new conditioner because the salon brand I loved, despite paying almost $50 for it, changed its formulation.  To my surprise, Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions is the one.  It smells nice going on, but avoids having a heavy, cloying scent that hangs around all day.  I can use a tiny amount (although that\'s par for the course with my hair).  Best of all, it does for my hair just what it says it will:  Allows my hair to maintain volume and hold its style.  Because I try so many different products looking for those that will work for me, I currently have five different conditioners in my shower.

As others have commented, frequent washing is often the culprit in drying out curly hair and making it unmanageable, so this may be the trade-off with any curly hair maintenance regime.

It still looks good but in order to get much lasting control for these situations you must be willing to live with what my girlfriend refers to as \'crunchy\' hair. It can look a little dull and feel crispy, but gets the job done.It\'s a versatile product best used lightly when you know you\'ll have a relaxed outing.

Its texture isn\'t as thick as some others, such as Neutrogena\'s Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner (which is an excellent product), but it does its job. The product claims to \'moisturize, control frizz and define curls,\' and while the results aren\'t miraculous, one can expect the hair to feel and look smoother, moisturized, and less frizzy after conditioning with this product (compared with no conditioner). It seems to be my experience that, if I blow-dry my hair completely after conditioning with this product, the hair looks somewhat smooth, but full and light at the same time (not weighed down). However, if you\'d like some \'defined curls,\' you might want to air-dry your hair a little rather than blow-drying it completely.

It has a pleasant, sweet smell that could conceivably trick people into believing it is my natural aroma, rather than the all-too-typical artificial odor of pears and alcohol (which is likely to make people think I drank too much and got into the stash of pears).In terms of functionality, this conditioner did a great job taming my somewhat frizzy hair, although it was no match for the occasionally intense humidity of DC summers.

I also live with a finicky man so I knew that whatever I buy, he would use too. Lets just say, if they made a 4-in-1 anything, he\'d be the first to buy. So I decided to go with this low maintenance 2-in-1 Classic Care, we both have fine hair so I didn\'t want to pick anything that would weigh it down. Needless to say, every day has been a good hair day with great-smelling bounce, wave, and volume; and the man is happy because he has one step to worry about. I will say that dryness has been an issue, as my hair feels like straw. The biggest downside to Pantene is that it contains loads of sulfates, which is the same ingredient in many grease-cutting detergents. I will buy this shampoo again, because it is easy and produces good looking results, but I will most likely supplement with a higher cost shampoo that has lower sulfates and more softening ability. "

I have used every really good shampoo for fine hair for several decades, so I have many different shampoos to compare this one to.After using Pantene\'s Pro-v for a few days, I am extremely impressed with it having all the great qualities that I require from a really good fine hair shampoo. The first thing I look for is a totally clear shampoo, because if you can see through it, it\'s not going to weigh down your fine hair, and this Pantene Pro-v is perfectly crystal clear. It has a lovely, very faint light citrus smell, which I like, as I don\'t like shampoo smells to clash with my favorite fragrances. It cleans really well and leaves your fine hair full of body and lift, which is exactly what a great fine hair shampoo should do.The main difference I noticed between my shampoo and this Pantene Pro-v is that Pantene Pro-v cleans really well, as in thoroughly super clean, leaving my hair much fuller with absolutely nothing weighing it down. When your hair is that clean, it\'s very important to use a good conditioner to replace lost moisture. Fine hair needs a very special type of conditioner that will not weigh hair down and flatten it, and the best conditioner I have ever found is one that rinses out minutes after it is put on after shampooing.This is a lovely light scented shampoo that cleans extremely well and leaves your fine hair feeling light, full and bouncy.

I tried this shampoo out because I\'ve had some good experiences with Pantene in the past and thought there was a chance that it might buoy my hair up at least just a tad!It certainly smells very nice and cleans my hair very well.  Some shampoos are less effective for me to the extent that I have to wash my hair more than once a day if I don\'t want it to become very oily; this shampoo definitely kept that from happening.  It also doesn\'t seem to leave any residue or buildup.On the other hand, I definitely didn\'t leave the house with suddenly voluminous hair. It was its flat, shiny, normal self.  But, like the guy who kept asking God if he could win the lottery and never bought a ticket, I\'m guessing you\'d have to meet the product half way to get results.  I\'d be reluctant to say that it didn\'t help with volume at all until I\'d given the blowdrier and curling iron a shot.Until then, it\'s a good shampoo, it does its job, and I\'ll continue to use it.

I have since cycled through many different brands and discovered that the conditioner alone doesn\'t really make that much difference to how your hair looks.  But I never had anything against Pantene so I couldn\'t pass up this Vine freebie.  Those of use with long curly hair go through a lot of conditioner.

227,231,20100613,B003JA3KDW,3,"June 13, 2010",A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,"OK conditioner, weird curling results","My hair has a natural wave that is easily coaxed into curls with a little gel or mousse and allowing to air dry.  The Pantene curly hair series conditioner doesn\'t condition my dry ends as much as other conditioners do, but at the same time it didn\'t make it worse as some products have, so I can\'t really complain.The conditioner is quite clingy in the shower, meaning it\'s really hard to massage into the entire length of my hair.  It wants to say where it was first applied, which is quite odd.  It rinses clean and smells nice.  I don\'t use more of it than I do any of Pantene\'s conditioners.When I use the conditioner and just let my hair air dry without product, my hair becomes what I suppose could be called \'curlier.\'  In fact, it\'s as though my hair gets separated out into a series of almost ringlet-like strands.  However, it\'s frizzy, and when I comb through my hair it loses those ringlet things and just becomes a fuzzy bunch of waves.  It is easily tamed by some (other brand) of mild leave-in conditioner and/or spray curl enhancer.  In comparison, I have some Pantene conditioner for dyed hair from their previous series and, while it doesn\'t leave my hair in those ringlet-curls, it also doesn\'t leave my hair frizzy either.When I use the curly hair series conditioner with product in my hair and let it air dry, the hair avoids the ringlet look and turns into what\'s more of an 80s perm, but not frizzy at all.  Combing it out produces a pretty nice series of controlled waves, but there is a tendency to frizz during the day.  Again comparing it with the Pantene conditioner for color-treated hair, it works about the same but provides more controlled waves than the color-treated version does.In all, I personally wouldn\'t buy the curl series conditioner.  Actually, I\'m not sure if I\'d buy any of their product as their current line exists.  See, I\'ve used many Pantene products over the years, and years ago I used Pantene curl products and liked them.  The conditioner was much better than this version; however, Pantene reformulates and repackages their products every few years, which not only means you lose the type of Pantene you liked to use, but also that it\'s hard to stick with Pantene as an overall brand.  I did (and do) continue to use Pantene, always buying whatever series had stronger conditioning than their ever-present Classic Care line.However, with this new series there is no high-conditioning product.  Right now they have Classic Care as they always do, plus curly, color treated, fine hair, medium-thick hair... well, my hair is 3 out of those 4, which do I choose?  I suspect everyone\'s hair falls into more than one of Pantene\'s categories.  It\'s possible there isn\'t a product in their current line-up for me to use, which means I\'ll have to wait 2-3 years until they reformulate yet again. "

But after switching from my regular (cheaper) shampoo to this, I thought I had started to develop dandruff--which is not something I ever have. Every morning during my morning styling, my shoulders would be covered with flakes by the time that I was done.  So there must be something in the shampoo that is intended to add body to the hair shaft, but it doesn\'t seem to want to stick there.  Just to double-check, I went back to my old shampoo and the \'dandruff\' suddenly went away.  I never got a sense of fuller body, either.  I\'ll give the product two stars for trying, but I will not continue to use it. "

My hair didn\'t get so stiff I couldn\'t run a comb through it, and it held fairly well with the exception of the other evening when it was very damp out (lots of dew at an outside reception). My hair still had its style; just a wee bit flatter. It would have been a lot flatter without the root boost. Nothing would have kept the style short of spray glue!While it does not hold like hair spray, it does keep the roots slightly \'boosted\' so your hair isn\'t super flat.

I bought this spray with my daughter in mind. Her hair is often unruly and is pretty curly. I wanted something that I could put in right after her baths so that she didn\'t have a frizzy halo effect. I tried it on her immediately and can\'t say I noticed much difference. The odor is pleasant and the fine mist spray was adequate. It rinsed easily off of my hands, which is a major plus.The real test was my hair. I sprayed it down and just twisted it into several quick twists that I secured with bobby pins. I forgot about it for 2 hours and then removed the pins. Wow. My hair was so curly, more than I\'ve ever achieved even with a curling iron. The gel spray really held them without my hair feeling too crunchy or full of product. I  quickly gave myself a Medusa-style \'do with the curls going straight up off my scalp. I fluffed and frizzed it up. The volume of it was almost scary. Then I thought I\'d really test the gel spray. A few spritzes on my giant bunch of curls and immediately they unfrizzed and were easier to tame without losing all the volume.Ilove how versatile my hair suddenly feels. This gel was really fun to use when I felt the whim to change things up. I think it\'s inspired me to keep trying out something difference, since my hair has been straight and flat year after year. For the price, its definitely worth a try. "

I used Pantene in the past, but I\'ve been using Suave for Men for several years now.  This product produces more lather than the Suave and seems to get my hair cleaner using much less shampoo.  So, while it might cost more per bottle, the value to me is greater with this.When I first started using this, it did seem to make my hair feel more dried out, which might just be because the Suave that I use also has a conditioner in it.  So, I now use a separate conditioner from time to time.  I took away one star for that, but if you already use a separate conditioner, then that\'s not an issue.It really does seem to give my hair more volume.  Perhaps it\'s simply cleaner than it was when I used the Suave, but I tend to think that it\'s doing what it claims to do. The scent is just fine to me, also.  So, I recommend giving it a try. "

I use the hairspray, shampoo, conditioner, heat protectant spray, and volumizing gel. The volumizing gel does make a great difference versus shampoo and conditioner alone. Even though I didn\'t get the results I hoped for from this product, I still use it because Pantene altogether has made my hair stronger and much healthier! Good product, affordable system. "

Overall I was pleased with the shampoo and it literally left my hair squeaky clean. I\'m not sure if that\'s necessarily a good thing since according to my wife that squeak is caused when shampoo strips the oil from your hair.

This new formula is much gentler. It has a gel-like consistency, which won\'t weigh hair down or make it oily as a creamy formula would. This shampoo made my hair very, very clean. So clean, in fact, that I could probably drop back to shampooing it every other day instead of every day as I normally would. I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick.As for volumizing properties, my hair didn\'t go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it\'s making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer.The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day. So if you are going to try this shampoo, you should definitely purchase the matching conditioner to keep the tangles at bay.Overall, I\'d say I am satisfied with this shampoo. It offers great cleansing, a mild floral scent, and modest volumizing properties. For those who say that it is too expensive, you can easily buy an off brand version of this at just about any grocery or superstore for about two and a half dollars a bottle. "

Well, maybe for a year or two in high school, but that\'s another story. I know that the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Conditioner is not intended for my kind of mane. But I figured, \'What the heck, conditioner is conditioner\'. I realize that isn\'t entirely true, but I certainly didn\'t think it could hurt.What I right? Yes! In fact, I have to say that the Pro-v Curly Hair Conditioner is one of the better after shampoo products I\'ve used. At around five bucks a pop, it isn\'t a bargain brand, but is less then many of the middle to high-end conditioners. I confess that I don\'t often use a conditioner unless it is a 2-in-1 version combined with a shampoo, but I do use my wife\'s from time to time. This Pantene Pro-v has all but the top-tier stuff beat.Granted, I don\'t have curly locks so I can\'t comment on how it works for the intended hair type, but for my short to medium straight hair, it\'s just dandy. My hair varies from one to six inches in length and after using the Pro-v conditioner; it was noticeably soft and manageable. No frizz to speak of. My wife\'s longer tresses like it too. She has wavy hair and her use of it produced similar results -- very soft, lots of body, no frizz. She was pleased. We\'d both recommend it for any hair type.If I had to change one thing, it would be to tone down the scent. It is not unpleasant and I enjoy smelling it on my wife\'s hair, but it isn\'t very masculine. I realize however I don\'t quite fit the target market for this product, so I can live with it.

It\'s hard for me to tell whether it really gave me any volume because my hair is layered to mask the flatness, anyway. It worked at least as well as my usual conditioner. The only thing I didn\'t like was the smell. It\'s not bad, but I prefer something lighter than the salon brand scent in this product.

As the treatment has grown out, the ends of my hair have become so brittle, dry and split. I\'ve even found several strands that look like wheat stocks on the end. Yuck!I\'ve tried all kinds of hair conditioners, lotions, home remedies, expensive leave-in, etc. And they all left much to be desired. In fact, much to my dismay, I\'ve had to chop of inches of hair at a time to get rid of the nasty locks.Then, one day, I was at the drugstore and saw this split end treatment. I though, \'hey, why not??\' I\'m sooooo glad I found this product. My hair feels softer than it has in years. And, although I still find some split ends, overall my hair no longer looks nor feels damaged. My only regret is that I didn\'t find this BEFORE I cut off so much of my hair. "
388,397,20100610,B004ISB3AG,4,"June 10, 2010",A2OCDK0BOW6UCY,Just Fine,"It is a challenge to style fine hair.  Obviously, a good cut and judicious use of product help.  But even under the best of circumstances, the volume just does not last. This shampoo claims to be formulated to give fine hair that much needed boost, which, when used with other products in the line, will last all day.As a shampoo it is just fine.  It lathers nicely and has a pleasant light fragrance. (The hair gods have truly cursed me..in addition to stubborn, wavy fine hair, my hair only holds obnoxious odors like cigarette smoke and the awful fried smell from grills.  So fragrance usually is not an issue for me.)  The shampoo did remove the product I had used previously and left my hair soft, shiny with nice body.  I did not notice any significant difference from this shampoo as opposed to any other.  Obviously, super clean hair has more volume and bounce than hair not in its first freshness.  I did also try it with a sample size of the conditioner and root lift and must say that the volume held, but again not significantly more so than when I use other light conditioners and root lift.  So while I probably am condemned to continue with a good cut and styling aids, this is a satisfactory product in all respects.  It is relatively inexpensive and delivers good results,.  So while the Breck girl has nothing to fear from,me, I will continue to use this shampoo as well as the root lift and conditioner. "

I have really curly long hair and I find that other products certainly weigh my hair down even if I use 50% less than this product. This product doesn\'t leave my hair crunchy it leaves it soft and bouncy. I find the price to be a really big draw as well since if you purchase one of these bottles at a store you are probably going to end up paying 6-7 dollars.

338,346,20100525,B004IS92L8,2,"May 25, 2010",A3BAOIC7JMCY6R,"Ehhhh, just ok!","This is a normal conditioner that I think a lot of people would use as an everyday addition to there hair maintainance. There is nothing truly special about it. The scent is very \'right off the shelf of the drug-store\'. It smells like every other bottle of pantene to me, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing. It is what it is!The conditioner doesn\'t seem to phase my completely unruly, pin straight, fine yet dense hair. I have the strangest hair. Some days it feels very thick and voluminous and others it feels very flat and light. I want a conditioner that adds a nice density to my fine strands but doesn\'t cause my scalp to get oily after a few hours. This doesn\'t do the trick for me.I am also turned off by the fact that this is NOT sls free. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the cheapest method for a company to get it\'s product lathering or textured a certain way and it is literaly the same stuff they use in car wash soaps and degreasing chemicals for car engines. In the same way as it dissolves the grease on the car engines, sodium lauryl sulfate also dissolves the oils on your skin, which can cause a drying effect, which in turn might cause an overproduction of oils, as is my case. It is also well documented that it denatures skin proteins, which causes not only irritation, but also allows environmental contaminants easier access to the lower, sensitive layers of the skin.Products with SLS are not only dangerous for the skin but they can also effect a person\'s hormones and lead to various forms of cancer. So, in the long run, it is better to invest the five bucks you would pay for a tube of this stuff and get something that is CLEARLY marked SLS-FREE. That said, for those less conscious or interested in the harm that SLS can cause...this conditioner will probably be a staple in your shower. It smells fresh and does it\'s job OK for that everyday-pantene price.It\'s not something I would ever buy or endorse though. "

I want my hair conditioned because it does get dry but I don\'t want it weighted down either so that the natural waves and curl will be there. This does a good job of allowing the curls and it doesn\'t seem to weigh my hair down but I still think that the Hydrating Curls line that pantene has is better than this product. I think it works better with my hair and I use less at each washing than this curly hair series.So while this is a good product the hydrating curls is better for me. "

I don\'t like using serums because they involve combing my hair with my fingers to saturate each strand, leaving it stringy and flat once it dries. Detangling sprays are the way to go. I\'ve used a lot of different brands in the past, and really you can\'t go wrong with many of them. But this one is special because it\'s specifically for my hair type. My hair has never looked so curly before. I wash my hair, spray the detangler lightly (too heavy and your hair will look greasy within a few hours), distribute it with my fingers, and leave it to dry. It turns out perfect every time. Without it my hair is just a frizzy mess.The second ingredient is a silicone called amodimethicone. I\'ve heard some bad things about silicones, but I think people are just paranoid about cheap hair ingredients. I don\'t notice any excessive drying or build-up in my hair, so I\'m not worried about it.The smell is awesome, too. It lingers for a long time and has a fresh, clean scent.I really hope Pantene sticks with this one. "

Unfortunately, I\'ve been largely disappointed, and this is no different.I have naturally curly/wavy/frizzy hair that I generally blow dry straight. Sometimes I leave it curly, though, and for that, I need a good conditioner that leaves it looking curly and not frizzy. I thought this was worth a try. But I can\'t tell any difference between this conditioner and the myriad other Pantene conditioners... the single line of theirs that feels different from the others is the Restoratives line (which I love, and is sometimes hard to find in stores). But as for this one, it feels exactly the same to me as their Moisture Renewal conditioner, Frizzy to Smooth conditioner, Smooth conditioner, etc. Which isn\'t surprising, considering the ingredient lists look almost identical.Different products work for different people, so I\'m not suggesting that this is a lousy conditioner-- only that it\'s not the right one for me.

That is, until I decided to let my hair grow longer, and found that it tangled after shampooing.  Like others, my hair is very fine with a slight curling.  The first time using the Pantene Flat to Volume Conditioner, I found that after drying, it felt like I was wearing a soft helmet...the hair did not move! (I did rinse well!) Second time was better, but found that using my curling iron to tame the curls really didn\'t help to keep a tighter curl...hair was wispy and fly-away. Each hair-washing I am using a smaller amount of conditioner so my hair won\'t be coated too much.  Maybe it\'s just my hair...looks more like cotton candy when worn long!  (Going back to short real soon!) I did notice that there is a \'volumizing system\' that is recommended by Pantene that creates the volume for your hair: Shampoo, Conditioner, and Root Lifter Spray Gel. (I think it is really the Gel that does the trick!) Anyway, the product has a nice scent, easy to apply, and for a lot of people, a Godsend! Therefore, I rate it 4 stars, keeping the 1 for us that just prefer only shampoo. "

It definitely has a little more bounce to it.  I\'m impressed with the results after using it for a few weeks.  The price @ Amazon is a bit expensive.  I haven\'t seen it in stores yet, but I\'m not sure it\'s worth nearly 6 dollars a bottle.  That\'s twice what normal Pantene costs at my local drug store.

It doesn\'t seem to weigh my hair down and, the one day I took the time to blow dry it and wear it down, it stayed fairly smooth and looked about as well as it always does. Did this conditioner actually make my hair look or feel \'fuller and thicker\' well, not really, and I didn\'t really expect it to either. Did it smooth and condition my hair? Yeah, and that\'s what I expected it to do. I wouldn\'t pay extra for this conditioner (above regular Pantene prices), but I wouldn\'t hesitate to choose it again either."

I am sure for some women this product is great (my mom seems to love it), but as always some products that work for some, may not work for others.

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos "

Same formula, same price....(WHY on earth do they do that?!)I almost always use the conditioner a lot faster than the shampoo, so I was happy to find this 3 pack in the \'subscribe and save\' store.All in all, my FAVORITE shampoo/conditioner set, and one I HIGHLY recommend.P.S.
