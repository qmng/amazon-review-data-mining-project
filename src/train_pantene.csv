This one seems to have found that happy balance between heavy and light.Right now I am giving this product four stars, as I do not know how well it will perform over a period of several months.  Will a residue built up on my hair?  I just don\'t know yet.

My hair felt clean and the scent was not too perfumey. On the other hand, I personally didn\'t feel like it performed any magic either.In my opinion, the real problem with this shampoo (or any other similar product), is it becomes difficult to test them with out purchasing a $5 bottle. If you like it great, if not, then what do you do with the rest?So in the end, my advice is to either see if you can buy a sample size or to call the company and see if they are willing to send you a sample. See if you like how it works with your hair, because i am confident you don\'t care how well it did or did not do with mine.",

I don\'t like using serums because they involve combing my hair with my fingers to saturate each strand, leaving it stringy and flat once it dries. Detangling sprays are the way to go. I\'ve used a lot of different brands in the past, and really you can\'t go wrong with many of them. But this one is special because it\'s specifically for my hair type. My hair has never looked so curly before. I wash my hair, spray the detangler lightly (too heavy and your hair will look greasy within a few hours), distribute it with my fingers, and leave it to dry. It turns out perfect every time. Without it my hair is just a frizzy mess.The second ingredient is a silicone called amodimethicone. I\'ve heard some bad things about silicones, but I think people are just paranoid about cheap hair ingredients.

I often suffer from frizziness or a lack of definition in my curls.This Pantene conditioner was average at best -- it smells nice, goes on easily, but leaves my hair feeling very coated -- in a slippery way, however, which is often nice with difficult to manage curly hair.  The matching shampoo was a terrible disappointment however (leaving my hair feeling unclean and coated in a non-slippery way) -- so I tried this conditioner with several other shampoos (both Pantene and non-Pantene sorts).  The best results came after  something like Pantene\'s old Ice Shine shampoo -- though still, only average smoothing and mild taming of my locks, which definitely felt over-coated even after a thorough rinsing.I second what an earlier reviewer said about silicone -- it\'s a shortcut for curly hair that seems to pay you back later in buildup and less-than-satisfactory results in the long run, and it\'s disappointing to find it in this product.I wouldn\'t go out of my way to recommend this conditioner, though I\'ll keep it on hand to use when I\'m out of everything else!",

Initially frizzy & poofy the day I wash, but frizz mostly dies after i sleep on it.I usually alternate between wearing my hair curly, flat ironing it, or just doing nothing to it and tying it back in a bun.  But the past few months I had given up on wearing my hair curly because I was tired of all the bad products out there. They either did nothing to combat my frizzies, left my curls looking thin and \'scrunchy\', or left my hair just totally flat, which is quite the accomplishment because I have very long, thick hair with a lot of natural volume.My prayers are answered with the Pantene Pro-V Curly line!! I usually always try & use organic products on my hair (without sulfites and stuff) so I was hesitant to try this. But I\'m so glad I did. I bought the shampoo, the conditioner, the mousse & the hairspray. Together they are awesome! After my shower i wrapped my hair in a towel on top of my head, after about 10 minutes i undid the towel, then gently (i try not to toussle my hair around too much when its wet because i feel as if this makes it more frizzy) ran a moderate amount of mouse throughout my curls, separating them and making sure i coat all my hair.I let my hair air dry and occasionally twisted a few curls here and there with my finger and added a teenny tiny bit more mousse here and there where i thought it was starting to frizz up. My curls look extra curly, lots of volume, not crunchy at all & it helped with the frizz A LOT too. I used the hairspray VERY sparingly, i feel as if this is the only product in the line that may cause any sort of \'crunchiness\', so be careful with that one. Just don\'t use too much.I will use this line whenever i want to wear my hair curly (which will now be more often) but I will stick with my organic shampoos for all other times.Also, ***side note***, I was due for a trim when i tried this product so the ends of my hair were very frayed, and anyone with curly hair knows that just makes your hair look even MORE frizzy. So i used a dollop of \'nexxus pro mend  leave in treatment creme\' on my ends and...AMAZING! I know it doesn\'t really \'mend\' my split ends, but it does temporarily bind them together making them practically invisible (until i wash my hair again) and cuts down on almost all the frizz, so my ends look awesome. So i suggest adding that to your curly hair routine if you have split ends",

But, like the guy who kept asking God if he could win the lottery and never bought a ticket, I\'m guessing you\'d have to meet the product half way to get results.

But even under the best of circumstances, the volume just does not last. This shampoo claims to be formulated to give fine hair that much needed boost, which, when used with other products in the line, will last all day.As a shampoo it is just fine.  It lathers nicely and has a pleasant light fragrance. (The hair gods have truly cursed me..in addition to stubborn, wavy fine hair, my hair only holds obnoxious odors like cigarette smoke and the awful fried smell from grills.  So fragrance usually is not an issue for me.)  The shampoo did remove the product I had used previously and left my hair soft, shiny with nice body.  I did not notice any significant difference from this shampoo as opposed to any other.  Obviously, super clean hair has more volume and bounce than hair not in its first freshness.  I did also try it with a sample size of the conditioner and root lift and must say that the volume held, but again not significantly more so than when I use other light conditioners and root lift.  So while I probably am condemned to continue with a good cut and styling aids, this is a satisfactory product in all respects.  It is relatively inexpensive and delivers good results,.

Because of that, I\'ve made an effort to try lots of Pantene products. Unfortunately, I\'ve been largely disappointed, and this is no different.I have naturally curly/wavy/frizzy hair that I generally blow dry straight. Sometimes I leave it curly, though, and for that, I need a good conditioner that leaves it looking curly and not frizzy. I thought this was worth a try. But I can\'t tell any difference between this conditioner and the myriad other Pantene conditioners... the single line of theirs that feels different from the others is the Restoratives line (which I love, and is sometimes hard to find in stores). But as for this one, it feels exactly the same to me as their Moisture Renewal conditioner, Frizzy to Smooth conditioner, Smooth conditioner, etc. Which isn\'t surprising, considering the ingredient lists look almost identical.Different products work for different people, so I\'m not suggesting that this is a lousy conditioner-- only that it\'s not the right one for me. It smells nice, it\'s an OK detangler, but my hair still looks frizzy and inconsistently textured when I use it.",

So, while it might cost more per bottle, the value to me is greater with this.When I first started using this, it did seem to make my hair feel more dried out, which might just be because the Suave that I use also has a conditioner in it.  So, I now use a separate conditioner from time to time.  I took away one star for that, but if you already use a separate conditioner, then that\'s not an issue.It really does seem to give my hair more volume.

Pantene Mousse for curly hair gives ringlets definition yet doesn\'t dry crunchy.  Apply to wet hair, comb to distribute, shape curls and let dry without touching. PLUS, when it\'s dry you can reactivate it with a spray of water and reshape your style. Most other products don\'t do that, and it\'s a definite bonus. Thank you Pantene!",

235,239,20100606,B003JA3KDW,4,"June 6, 2010",A3S96B2GBP04N2,Too much perfume but satisfied with it\'s performance,"Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works as advertised. It\'s a nice thick conditioner which controls the frizz and helps to detangle your hair in the shower.My hair type is thick and coarse and naturally wavy and tends to frizz. I usually use a leave in glossing cream after I wash my hair to detangle my hair without breakage and to keep my hair from becoming a frizzy mess.I live in Texas and right now the summer is coming on and it\'s hot and humid so it\'s the perfect recipe for my hair to frizz.The first time I used this conditioner was after swimming and there was no way I could run a comb through my hair without help.  After shampooing with my normal shampoo I was able to detangle my hair using the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner in the shower with no breakage. The conditioner is thick so it coats my hair well while in the shower but it doesn\'t feel as if the conditioner rinses completely out of the hair.However after stepping out of the shower and toweling off the conditioning results weren\'t there and I still felt as I needed something to help comb my wet hair.I believe the reason for this is, is because of one of the ingredients used in this conditioner called \'Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\'.  Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone is a silicone which is used to coat the hair and is not water soluable so it creates the \'conditioning\' feel you feel when in the shower while the water is pouring over your head but once you step out of the shower it doesn\'t feel the same because it leaves a film behind which doesn\'t allow the hair to slide easily between each other.On the other hand the \'film\' Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone leaves behind is suppose to help control frizz which so far it has done well for me.I have used other Pantene daily conditioners before in the past and unless it was a treatment conditioner such as Pantene\'s \'Deep Fortifying\' conditioners then Pantene\'s daily conditioners are usually rather thin and never worked very well .If you have used Pantene\'s treatment conditioners then you have a general idea of the consistency and results of the Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner.The one thing I really did not like is the smell of this conditioner.  The perfume is much stronger with this product than with Pantene\'s other products. It\'s not over whelming but noticeable stronger than another of Pantene\'s product I currently own.I am sensitive to scents so what I feel is too much isn\'t always the case for someone else.  If you are someone who doesn\'t like a lot of perfume you may want to give this product a whiff the next time you are at a grocery store before you purchase it here from Amazon.I do not know if I will continue using this product. This is my third wash using this conditioner and so far I am happy with the results but I\'m sensitive to products which contain sulfates and with anything that leaves a film behind a strong cleaner is definitely needed to help remove build up between uses. If I notice that my non-sulfate shampoos are sufficient in cleaning between conditioning with this  than I\'ll probably stick to using this otherwise I\'ll probably return to my normal routine.In conclusion I give it a 4 stars because I believe that Pantene\'s Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works well for those battling frizzy hair and after my hair dried it was extremely soft but I don\'t care for the perfume because I feel it\'s too strong.I like to give a Pro and Con breakdown for each of my reviews so here is the list for this one.Pros1. Controls Frizz2. Thick conditioner which helps it stay put where neededCon1.  I don\'t care for the heavy perfume smell",

This new formula is much gentler. It has a gel-like consistency, which won\'t weigh hair down or make it oily as a creamy formula would. This shampoo made my hair very, very clean. So clean, in fact, that I could probably drop back to shampooing it every other day instead of every day as I normally would. I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick.As for volumizing properties, my hair didn\'t go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it\'s making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer.The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day. So if you are going to try this shampoo, you should definitely purchase the matching conditioner to keep the tangles at bay.Overall, I\'d say I am satisfied with this shampoo. It offers great cleansing, a mild floral scent, and modest volumizing properties.

One of the reasons is that it\'s strong enough to really clean your hair but not so harsh that it dries your scalp.

Granted, if I colored my hair again I would use a shampoo made especially for treated hair (probably Pantene, since I\'m a creature of habit).As far as conditioning I have to say that it is very light.  For my daughter, for example, who has fine, straight, but remarkably easy-to-tangle hair, we still have to use a detangler.

While there are a few safe ingredients, I was concerned about a few of the chemicals listed.  I wish manufacturers would also stop adding fragrance.  If deodorant has it, and hair spray has it, and you use perfume, how many fragrances do you need at one time?  But until more women feel this way, companies are likely compelled to add yet one more chemical to the mix.  To be REALLY fair, I would probably go to a store and read the ingredients on a lot more shampoo bottles.  Pro-V may not be any worse than other shampoos.While I am not chemically sensitive, others are.  But these people are probably buying products at the health food store instead of the drug store.

The product claims to \'moisturize, control frizz and define curls,\' and while the results aren\'t miraculous, one can expect the hair to feel and look smoother, moisturized, and less frizzy after conditioning with this product (compared with no conditioner). It seems to be my experience that, if I blow-dry my hair completely after conditioning with this product, the hair looks somewhat smooth, but full and light at the same time (not weighed down). However, if you\'d like some \'defined curls,\' you might want to air-dry your hair a little rather than blow-drying it completely.

The more expensive brands leave your hair feeling softer and less tangle-y than the cheaper versions do, and this conditioner definitely feels nice on the hair and leaves it very soft and manageable.I have curly hair so I thought I would give this one a try.  It\'s a good conditioner, but is it any better for my hair than say any other Pantene conditioner on the market?  I\'d have to say no.  I can\'t tell the difference between using this formulation or the regular Pantene.  My hair still requires me to put anti-frizz products in it, and it doesn\'t look any different after using this conditioner than another kind quite honestly.But that aside, the reason to buy this particular product is that this DOES leave hair soft and able to be combed right out of the shower (unlike some cheap conditioners) so that is why I give it 4 stars.  I don\'t believe there is any conditioner on the market currently that can truly manage the frizz of curly hair, and probably there never will be.  You will always have to follow your same routine and use additional product after your shower if you need to control the frizz inherent in curly hair.",

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos",

This IS the \'Time Renewal Restorative\' in repackaged form!,"My hair is naturally curly and definitely gets frizzy. When Pantene released the Time Renewal series, I tried the \'Frizz smoothing\' formula and was THRILLED with the results. I always feel my hair is incredibly soft, shiny, manageable and best of all SMOOTH after using the shampoo and conditioner. It is also the only shampoo/conditioner that I can remember ever using the the smallest amount still lathers its way completely through even extremely long hair.So I kept it on hand, and then Walmart stopped carrying the product!When I finally noticed this product, with its purple and gold writing on the front, like the previous reviewer I did a little research and voila! This IS the exact same stuff! Same formula, same price....(WHY on earth do they do that?!)I almost always use the conditioner a lot faster than the shampoo, so I was happy to find this 3 pack in the \'subscribe and save\' store.All in all, my FAVORITE shampoo/conditioner set, and one I HIGHLY recommend.P.S. Try pouring plain white vinegar into your hair after the conditioner, letting it sit just a few minutes, then rinsing it! Vinegar (super cheap stuff!) strips the excess materials from the hair and balances the pH. Shiny, soft, and smooth!",
308,316,20100616,B004IS92L8,4,"June 16, 2010",A1SYLII0808HD6,For the Francophile and the Thin of Hair,"THe wonders of advertising. There\'s a certain segment of the population that perceives a certain elegance, an elan, if you will (or if you won\'t), a panache and flair to products named with a bon mot. Pantene... it sounds elegant(though it has no French meaning--not that it matters) and, by the way, it works pretty darn well.That\'s the most important thing here, Pantene \'FIne Hair SOlutions Flat to Volume\' Conditioner does what it says it will do: Add s bit of of volume (or the appearance of volume) by coating your hair strands, and adding sheen by aligning them.  IT reduce tangles, does not have an unpleasant smell, and basically has a reasonable price. Yes, you can go cheaper, and you might as well give those a try.While we\'re talking about language, what\'s with the name \'Flat to Volume\' --is it an awkward shorthand for \'Your hair looks flat, see, and this stuff will give it VOLUME. Therefore, Flat to Volume!\'  IT might annoy you for a few seconds, or perhaps this is Pantenese, and I\'m the one who should know better.Pantene comes out of the bottle fairly thick, so use just a little. Spread it around your hair, and it becomes much less viscous. I\'d recommend also that you rinse thoroughly.  I thought I detected a slight allergic reaction on my part (some itching) compared to not using it, but this is a tenuous connection and may have nothing to do with the product.  However, like all beauty/cosmetic products, it\'s probably better to buy ONE of these first to determine whether you have any adverse reactions.  Bottom line: I\'d buy it again, but it didn\'t blow me away either.  If you\'re not happy with the conditioner you use now and you tend towards the thin hair end of the follicle spectrum, then this is certainly worth a try. Bon chance a vous!

I\'m very pleased with the results so far.  It provides more lift and stylability than I\'ve achieved with other shampoos. My hair is looking better than it has in a while. Since my hair isn\'t oily, I was a little concerned that the extra lift is reportedly achieved by removing oil from the hair. My hair doesn\'t look or feel dry after use, but still I thought I should add the companion conditioner just to be safe.  So far am pleased with it too.  Most conditioners make my hair hopelessly flat, but this product works well with the shampoo and doesn\'t counteract the shampoo\'s benefits.After using this shampoo, my scalp, which tends to be itchy, also feels good.  Since I use a lot of hair spray, I wonder if it is more effective at removing that residue from my scalp than other shampoos.  Don\'t know, but I do know my scalp feels better and my hair looks good.  Can\'t beat that. I\'m very pleased with this product and recommend it to others who need a boost in the hair department.",

Since moving to the Pacific northwest 14 years ago, I feel like my hair has a multiple personality disorder. I found a Fekkai product not too long ago tht finally relaxed things enough to where my hair started to look normal and shiny again. But Fekkai products are spendy and I was still hoping to find something more budget friendly. This fits the bill. It is about 1/3 the price of the Fekkai product and it a comparable job. I used about a dime sized amount for shoulder length hair.I let my hair air dry, and my waves actually curled up quite nicely. This really surprised me as I didn\'t have to do additional styling.The one recommendation I do have is to use a small amount or to alternate it with a lighter conditioner. Using too much does cause some oily buildup and my hair went flat at the roots.",

This is something of a concern for me because I\'ve read that quick drying products usually have a lot of alcohol, and alcohol as you know tends to be drying and hard on hair.

Best of all, it does for my hair just what it says it will:  Allows my hair to maintain volume and hold its style.  Because I try so many different products looking for those that will work for me, I currently have five different conditioners in my shower.
