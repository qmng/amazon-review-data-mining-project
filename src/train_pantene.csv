I recommend it.No allergic reaction thus far.  I have several skin allergies and sensitivities, and have experienced minor problems with a few other shampoos, and not-so-minor problems with several kinds of soap.  I will add a comment to this review if I have a later reaction or other problems.It has made my straight, flat hair look somewhat fluffy; it appears to have more body. Note that this was achieved by merely shampooing, followed by partial drying with a towel; no blow dryer used.The shampoo seems somewhat concentrated, not watered down.  It left my hair and scalp feeling thoroughly clean.  Unlike some shampoos, it has not left my hair feeling as if it were coated with anything greasy or heavy; just clean hair.While shampooing, I noticed only a very subtle scent, that was not specifically feminine nor masculine. It did not leave a noticeable scent my the hair.  A day later, if I bury my sensitive nose in my hair, I can just barely detect a vaguely plant-like scent, gender-neutral.P.S.  My husband also uses this shampoo, and it works well for him too.",

This product is equivalent to many of the other volumizing shampoos on the market that I already tried.

I was looking for a nice, deep conditioner for my textured hair, and another young lady in the aisle at the store told me about this product.  Normally there are products specifically designed for our hair but these Patene is quite wonderful! It leaves my hair very, very soft and tangle-free. I normally put on the conditioner, then a shower cap and leave it on for a good 20 minutes, but with this product I leave it on for 5 minutes (no shower cap) and bam, that\'s it!  Soft, manageable hair.  It\'s good that I don\'t necessarily have to go to the special section in the hair products aisle to get my conditioners now that those for our type of hair are mainstream now.",

I\'ve been using this product since 2007 & I loved it soooo much. This new packaging came along with a changed formula that does the same thing most of these so called mositurizers do for black hair :NOTHING but sit on the hair. It no longer absorbs into my hair. Used practically the whole tube in 2 days where the old tube would last me at least 3 weeks. And still, nothing. My hair is just STIFF.

My hair didn\'t get so stiff I couldn\'t run a comb through it, and it held fairly well with the exception of the other evening when it was very damp out (lots of dew at an outside reception). My hair still had its style; just a wee bit flatter. It would have been a lot flatter without the root boost. Nothing would have kept the style short of spray glue!While it does not hold like hair spray, it does keep the roots slightly \'boosted\' so your hair isn\'t super flat.

I used this shampoo for a week to see how it would hold up in all sorts of weather. It is nice and creamy with a great scent. Rinsed off clean with no residue as some volumizing shampoos will do. My hair felt softer and held a curl a bit better than normal. The one downfall was during very humid weather, when it didn\'t really seem to make a difference. (nothing does!) My husband also used it and really liked the clean feeling he had after using it as well. The scent wasn\'t too girlie either.",
26,26,20111018,B001F51V3E,4,"October 18, 2011",A26YLGU5AJQG1W,"Great Body, but Dry to the Touch","It had been about 10 years since I had used Pantene so I decided to try it again as the commercials are mesmerizing and I remember how great my hair smelled. I also live with a finicky man so I knew that whatever I buy, he would use too. Lets just say, if they made a 4-in-1 anything, he\'d be the first to buy. So I decided to go with this low maintenance 2-in-1 Classic Care, we both have fine hair so I didn\'t want to pick anything that would weigh it down. Needless to say, every day has been a good hair day with great-smelling bounce, wave, and volume; and the man is happy because he has one step to worry about. I will say that dryness has been an issue, as my hair feels like straw. The biggest downside to Pantene is that it contains loads of sulfates, which is the same ingredient in many grease-cutting detergents. I will buy this shampoo again, because it is easy and produces good looking results, but I will most likely supplement with a higher cost shampoo that has lower sulfates and more softening ability.",

197,199,20100722,B003JA3KDW,3,"July 22, 2010",A5GPH59NDWJRB,I can\'t tell the difference,"A hairdresser told me a long time ago that Pantene is the best nonprofessional brand there is, and it\'s about as good as the salon brands. Because of that, I\'ve made an effort to try lots of Pantene products. Unfortunately, I\'ve been largely disappointed, and this is no different.I have naturally curly/wavy/frizzy hair that I generally blow dry straight. Sometimes I leave it curly, though, and for that, I need a good conditioner that leaves it looking curly and not frizzy. I thought this was worth a try. But I can\'t tell any difference between this conditioner and the myriad other Pantene conditioners... the single line of theirs that feels different from the others is the Restoratives line (which I love, and is sometimes hard to find in stores). But as for this one, it feels exactly the same to me as their Moisture Renewal conditioner, Frizzy to Smooth conditioner, Smooth conditioner, etc. Which isn\'t surprising, considering the ingredient lists look almost identical.Different products work for different people, so I\'m not suggesting that this is a lousy conditioner-- only that it\'s not the right one for me. It smells nice, it\'s an OK detangler, but my hair still looks frizzy and inconsistently textured when I use it.",

Pantene is a cheaper alternative to the much better Nexxus curl mousse. It holds pretty well in humid weather but only lasts 24 hours. The next day you get serious product flaking that won\'t go away with the addition of water. Overall, a decent curl product if you want to wash your hair everyday, but for dry hair, splurge for Nexxus.",

This is mainly the reason I do not use conditioner because usually limits the newly washed hair \'volume\'.I tried the Pantene Pro-V Volume shampoo and could say that it is a very good product, smells nice, I have no alergic reaction to it and it gives my hair shine and volume that last more than a day as it happends with most of the other brands.Highly recommended.",

I do not color my hair or use a blow dryer on it. I let it dry naturally after gently wrapping a towel around it to absorb most of the water. I usually use the Garnier Length and Strength shampoo.Pros: Hair feels smooth as you rinse the conditioner outLess tangle after rinsingSmells better than the matching shampooCons: My hair now has a \'fly-away\' problem, which I usually only have in winter when it is dry outside and my hair has alot of static.I am losing more hair than usual on a daily basis since I started using this, normally my daily normal \'fall-out\' of hair is 10 or less, since I started using this and the matching conditioner, I am loosing about 30 strands a dayMy hair looks duller.Overall conclusion, I am going back to my usual shampoo and conditioner and not going to use this on a regular basis.",

It\'s....nice... but not spectacular.  Not much difference in any of the Pro-V products that I have tried so far.  I have fine, very dry, very curly hair, that in my old age tends to look very frizzy, especially in this humid summer weather.  I am still looking for the magic bullet conditioner/shampoo combo that will help control the dry frizz.  Pantene is better than most, but I\'m still looking for better....",
231,235,20100610,B003JA3KDW,3,"June 10, 2010",A2XXTGHE0YVZSZ,I liked it enough for my coarse or permed hair,"I think this may be a workable conditioner for those with coarse or permed hair. Its texture isn\'t as thick as some others, such as Neutrogena\'s Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner (which is an excellent product), but it does its job. The product claims to \'moisturize, control frizz and define curls,\' and while the results aren\'t miraculous, one can expect the hair to feel and look smoother, moisturized, and less frizzy after conditioning with this product (compared with no conditioner). It seems to be my experience that, if I blow-dry my hair completely after conditioning with this product, the hair looks somewhat smooth, but full and light at the same time (not weighed down). However, if you\'d like some \'defined curls,\' you might want to air-dry your hair a little rather than blow-drying it completely. No matter what, if you have coarse fly-aways like mine, some other products may still be needed for a more \'polished\' look (hair gel, serum, or the like).",

In that respect, this Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair conditioner is a winner. It has a pleasant, sweet smell that could conceivably trick people into believing it is my natural aroma, rather than the all-too-typical artificial odor of pears and alcohol (which is likely to make people think I drank too much and got into the stash of pears).In terms of functionality, this conditioner did a great job taming my somewhat frizzy hair, although it was no match for the occasionally intense humidity of DC summers. On those days, my hair doesn\'t care what kind of conditioner I put in it.Overall, I recommend this conditioner, especially if you are a guy who does not want to smell like peaches and sunshine.",

I tried the companion shampoo to this conditioner and really like the lift it gives my hair, but worried a little that it might be drying--didn\'t notice that, but to be proactive, I decided to try this companion conditioner as well.  It\'s great.  I still get the nice lift from the shampoo, plus my hair is manageable and feels healthy.Today, I colored my hair (which is really drying) but I know from experience that the conditioner that comes with my hair color leaves my hair even more flat and limp than usual.  It won\'t even hold a style.  I decided to try this conditioner instead, and am I ever pleased. I have none of the extra dryness that usually results from coloring, but still have nice lift, body and sheen.  It seems like I get all the advantages of a conditioner without the disadvantages.

The first day I used the Pantene flat to volume conditioner I went out with some friends and my friends complimented me on actually styling my hair.  I didn\'t style my hair, the conditioner was enough of a change for my hair that I din\'t look like a mop.  The scent is clean and yummy, the conditioner is great at detangling my snarled hair, and I did notice that my hair looked healthier, I assume this healthy look was my hair showing volume.",

That is, until I decided to let my hair grow longer, and found that it tangled after shampooing.  Like others, my hair is very fine with a slight curling.  The first time using the Pantene Flat to Volume Conditioner, I found that after drying, it felt like I was wearing a soft helmet...the hair did not move! (I did rinse well!) Second time was better, but found that using my curling iron to tame the curls really didn\'t help to keep a tighter curl...hair was wispy and fly-away. Each hair-washing I am using a smaller amount of conditioner so my hair won\'t be coated too much.  Maybe it\'s just my hair...looks more like cotton candy when worn long!  (Going back to short real soon!) I did notice that there is a \'volumizing system\' that is recommended by Pantene that creates the volume for your hair: Shampoo, Conditioner, and Root Lifter Spray Gel. (I think it is really the Gel that does the trick!) Anyway, the product has a nice scent, easy to apply, and for a lot of people, a Godsend!

Nothing else gives me the results I want every single time except this conditioner. I have long, medium thick, black hair which is very prone to frizz and I don\'t really have the time to spend (or money) to sit in a saloon once or twice a month. So this product absolutely helps to the point where I must always have a bottle in the shower. I suppose you could mix and match any shampoo, but I typically just go with the same line of shampoo (to match the chemistry and everything). I still need to follow it with straightening iron, and get the semi-wavy/straight/messy look.If you have very thick hair then this product might not do much for you, but for those with medium thick hair that gets frizzy after you dry, I really recommend this.",

I used it with my regular shampoo (Pantene Beautiful Lengths Shine Enhance Shampoo) and my hair was soft and smooth again. As soon as I applied it in the shower I could feel the difference.

To tell the truth, I don\'t see much difference if she uses the \'Curly\' conditioner vs a regular Pantene moisturizing conditioner.

If deodorant has it, and hair spray has it, and you use perfume, how many fragrances do you need at one time?  But until more women feel this way, companies are likely compelled to add yet one more chemical to the mix.  To be REALLY fair, I would probably go to a store and read the ingredients on a lot more shampoo bottles.  Pro-V may not be any worse than other shampoos.While I am not chemically sensitive, others are.  But these people are probably buying products at the health food store instead of the drug store.

One of the reasons is that it\'s strong enough to really clean your hair but not so harsh that it dries your scalp.  In the past I\'ve had highlights and I\'ve used this shampoo without any detrimental effects.  Granted, if I colored my hair again I would use a shampoo made especially for treated hair (probably Pantene, since I\'m a creature of habit).As far as conditioning I have to say that it is very light.  For my daughter, for example, who has fine, straight, but remarkably easy-to-tangle hair, we still have to use a detangler.  So it\'s a lighter conditioning effect than if you used a separate conditioner.  Personally I like this because it doesn\'t \'weigh\' down my hair, just controls the humidity frizzes.OVERALL, a gentle, thorough cleanser with gentle conditioning that makes combing after shampooing easier.Pam T~mom-blogger",

The Pantene curly hair series conditioner doesn\'t condition my dry ends as much as other conditioners do, but at the same time it didn\'t make it worse as some products have, so I can\'t really complain.The conditioner is quite clingy in the shower, meaning it\'s really hard to massage into the entire length of my hair.  It wants to say where it was first applied, which is quite odd.  It rinses clean and smells nice.  I don\'t use more of it than I do any of Pantene\'s conditioners.When I use the conditioner and just let my hair air dry without product, my hair becomes what I suppose could be called \'curlier.\'  In fact, it\'s as though my hair gets separated out into a series of almost ringlet-like strands.  However, it\'s frizzy, and when I comb through my hair it loses those ringlet things and just becomes a fuzzy bunch of waves.  It is easily tamed by some (other brand) of mild leave-in conditioner and/or spray curl enhancer.  In comparison, I have some Pantene conditioner for dyed hair from their previous series and, while it doesn\'t leave my hair in those ringlet-curls, it also doesn\'t leave my hair frizzy either.When I use the curly hair series conditioner with product in my hair and let it air dry, the hair avoids the ringlet look and turns into what\'s more of an 80s perm, but not frizzy at all.  Combing it out produces a pretty nice series of controlled waves, but there is a tendency to frizz during the day.  Again comparing it with the Pantene conditioner for color-treated hair, it works about the same but provides more controlled waves than the color-treated version does.In all, I personally wouldn\'t buy the curl series conditioner.  Actually, I\'m not sure if I\'d buy any of their product as their current line exists.  See, I\'ve used many Pantene products over the years, and years ago I used Pantene curl products and liked them.  The conditioner was much better than this version; however, Pantene reformulates and repackages their products every few years, which not only means you lose the type of Pantene you liked to use, but also that it\'s hard to stick with Pantene as an overall brand.  I did (and do) continue to use Pantene, always buying whatever series had stronger conditioning than their ever-present Classic Care line.However, with this new series there is no high-conditioning product.  Right now they have Classic Care as they always do, plus curly, color treated, fine hair, medium-thick hair... well, my hair is 3 out of those 4, which do I choose?  I suspect everyone\'s hair falls into more than one of Pantene\'s categories.  It\'s possible there isn\'t a product in their current line-up for me to use, which means I\'ll have to wait 2-3 years until they reformulate yet again.",

There\'s a certain segment of the population that perceives a certain elegance, an elan, if you will (or if you won\'t), a panache and flair to products named with a bon mot. Pantene... it sounds elegant(though it has no French meaning--not that it matters) and, by the way, it works pretty darn well.That\'s the most important thing here, Pantene \'FIne Hair SOlutions Flat to Volume\' Conditioner does what it says it will do: Add s bit of of volume (or the appearance of volume) by coating your hair strands, and adding sheen by aligning them.  IT reduce tangles, does not have an unpleasant smell, and basically has a reasonable price. Yes, you can go cheaper, and you might as well give those a try.While we\'re talking about language, what\'s with the name \'Flat to Volume\' --is it an awkward shorthand for \'Your hair looks flat, see, and this stuff will give it VOLUME. Therefore, Flat to Volume!\'  IT might annoy you for a few seconds, or perhaps this is Pantenese, and I\'m the one who should know better.Pantene comes out of the bottle fairly thick, so use just a little. Spread it around your hair, and it becomes much less viscous. I\'d recommend also that you rinse thoroughly.  I thought I detected a slight allergic reaction on my part (some itching) compared to not using it, but this is a tenuous connection and may have nothing to do with the product.  However, like all beauty/cosmetic products, it\'s probably better to buy ONE of these first to determine whether you have any adverse reactions.  Bottom line: I\'d buy it again, but it didn\'t blow me away either.  If you\'re not happy with the conditioner you use now and you tend towards the thin hair end of the follicle spectrum, then this is certainly worth a try. Bon chance a vous!

I tried it on her immediately and can\'t say I noticed much difference. The odor is pleasant and the fine mist spray was adequate. It rinsed easily off of my hands, which is a major plus.The real test was my hair. I sprayed it down and just twisted it into several quick twists that I secured with bobby pins. I forgot about it for 2 hours and then removed the pins. Wow. My hair was so curly, more than I\'ve ever achieved even with a curling iron. The gel spray really held them without my hair feeling too crunchy or full of product. I  quickly gave myself a Medusa-style \'do with the curls going straight up off my scalp. I fluffed and frizzed it up. The volume of it was almost scary. Then I thought I\'d really test the gel spray. A few spritzes on my giant bunch of curls and immediately they unfrizzed and were easier to tame without losing all the volume.Ilove how versatile my hair suddenly feels. This gel was really fun to use when I felt the whim to change things up. I think it\'s inspired me to keep trying out something difference, since my hair has been straight and flat year after year.

If you like it great, if not, then what do you do with the rest?So in the end, my advice is to either see if you can buy a sample size or to call the company and see if they are willing to send you a sample.

But even under the best of circumstances, the volume just does not last. This shampoo claims to be formulated to give fine hair that much needed boost, which, when used with other products in the line, will last all day.As a shampoo it is just fine.  It lathers nicely and has a pleasant light fragrance. (The hair gods have truly cursed me..in addition to stubborn, wavy fine hair, my hair only holds obnoxious odors like cigarette smoke and the awful fried smell from grills.  So fragrance usually is not an issue for me.)  The shampoo did remove the product I had used previously and left my hair soft, shiny with nice body.  I did not notice any significant difference from this shampoo as opposed to any other.  Obviously, super clean hair has more volume and bounce than hair not in its first freshness.  I did also try it with a sample size of the conditioner and root lift and must say that the volume held, but again not significantly more so than when I use other light conditioners and root lift.  So while I probably am condemned to continue with a good cut and styling aids, this is a satisfactory product in all respects.  It is relatively inexpensive and delivers good results,.

It seems to be helping (in conjunction with the Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair series shampoo that I purchased separately). Her hair is less tangled and seems to be stronger and less dry, no small feat with our water, which seems to be extremely chlorinated and dries everyone\'s hair out a good bit. It of course smells great and seems softer to the touch as well. She\'s used much more expensive hair care products before, and these seem to be as good as any of those have been, if not better. While I don\'t think the effects are quite as dramatic as we were hoping for, I see that as a problem with our water rather than blaming it on this conditioner.

This new formula is much gentler. It has a gel-like consistency, which won\'t weigh hair down or make it oily as a creamy formula would. This shampoo made my hair very, very clean. So clean, in fact, that I could probably drop back to shampooing it every other day instead of every day as I normally would. I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick.As for volumizing properties, my hair didn\'t go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it\'s making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer.The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day. So if you are going to try this shampoo, you should definitely purchase the matching conditioner to keep the tangles at bay.Overall, I\'d say I am satisfied with this shampoo. It offers great cleansing, a mild floral scent, and modest volumizing properties. For those who say that it is too expensive, you can easily buy an off brand version of this at just about any grocery or superstore for about two and a half dollars a bottle.",

I have used every really good shampoo for fine hair for several decades, so I have many different shampoos to compare this one to.After using Pantene\'s Pro-v for a few days, I am extremely impressed with it having all the great qualities that I require from a really good fine hair shampoo. The first thing I look for is a totally clear shampoo, because if you can see through it, it\'s not going to weigh down your fine hair, and this Pantene Pro-v is perfectly crystal clear. It has a lovely, very faint light citrus smell, which I like, as I don\'t like shampoo smells to clash with my favorite fragrances. It cleans really well and leaves your fine hair full of body and lift, which is exactly what a great fine hair shampoo should do.The main difference I noticed between my shampoo and this Pantene Pro-v is that Pantene Pro-v cleans really well, as in thoroughly super clean, leaving my hair much fuller with absolutely nothing weighing it down. When your hair is that clean, it\'s very important to use a good conditioner to replace lost moisture. Fine hair needs a very special type of conditioner that will not weigh hair down and flatten it, and the best conditioner I have ever found is one that rinses out minutes after it is put on after shampooing.This is a lovely light scented shampoo that cleans extremely well and leaves your fine hair feeling light, full and bouncy. Just remember to use a really good rinse-out, daily-use conditioner as this lovely 5 Star shampoo leaves your hair really squeaky clean!",

It was suggested that I find a mousse, so I found this one at the store. I put this in my hair while still wet, then blow dry upside down for a bit. Then blow dry with a round brush to get the style I want. I was really impressed how my hairstyle actually kept its shape and body throughout the entire day in dry or damp weather (though it flattens out if it gets rained on), and even when I wake up in the morning. Best of all it isn\'t crusty and doesn\'t make my hair feel heavy or oily. This is my first experience with a mousse hair product, so I can\'t compare it to other brands.

Well, maybe for a year or two in high school, but that\'s another story. I know that the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Conditioner is not intended for my kind of mane. But I figured, \'What the heck, conditioner is conditioner\'. I realize that isn\'t entirely true, but I certainly didn\'t think it could hurt.What I right? Yes! In fact, I have to say that the Pro-v Curly Hair Conditioner is one of the better after shampoo products I\'ve used. At around five bucks a pop, it isn\'t a bargain brand, but is less then many of the middle to high-end conditioners. I confess that I don\'t often use a conditioner unless it is a 2-in-1 version combined with a shampoo, but I do use my wife\'s from time to time. This Pantene Pro-v has all but the top-tier stuff beat.Granted, I don\'t have curly locks so I can\'t comment on how it works for the intended hair type, but for my short to medium straight hair, it\'s just dandy. My hair varies from one to six inches in length and after using the Pro-v conditioner; it was noticeably soft and manageable. No frizz to speak of. My wife\'s longer tresses like it too. She has wavy hair and her use of it produced similar results -- very soft, lots of body, no frizz. She was pleased. We\'d both recommend it for any hair type.If I had to change one thing, it would be to tone down the scent. It is not unpleasant and I enjoy smelling it on my wife\'s hair, but it isn\'t very masculine. I realize however I don\'t quite fit the target market for this product, so I can live with it. It certainly won\'t keep me from finishing the bottle!",

186,188,20110519,B003JA3KDW,5,"May 19, 2011",A3DA9VIVHJBAJO,Review of the entire pantene curly line,"HAIR TYPE: Long, thick, \'squiggly\' style curls (~~~~ they look like that) & a few random spirals here and there.  Initially frizzy & poofy the day I wash, but frizz mostly dies after i sleep on it.I usually alternate between wearing my hair curly, flat ironing it, or just doing nothing to it and tying it back in a bun.  But the past few months I had given up on wearing my hair curly because I was tired of all the bad products out there. They either did nothing to combat my frizzies, left my curls looking thin and \'scrunchy\', or left my hair just totally flat, which is quite the accomplishment because I have very long, thick hair with a lot of natural volume.My prayers are answered with the Pantene Pro-V Curly line!! I usually always try & use organic products on my hair (without sulfites and stuff) so I was hesitant to try this. But I\'m so glad I did. I bought the shampoo, the conditioner, the mousse & the hairspray. Together they are awesome! After my shower i wrapped my hair in a towel on top of my head, after about 10 minutes i undid the towel, then gently (i try not to toussle my hair around too much when its wet because i feel as if this makes it more frizzy) ran a moderate amount of mouse throughout my curls, separating them and making sure i coat all my hair.I let my hair air dry and occasionally twisted a few curls here and there with my finger and added a teenny tiny bit more mousse here and there where i thought it was starting to frizz up. My curls look extra curly, lots of volume, not crunchy at all & it helped with the frizz A LOT too. I used the hairspray VERY sparingly, i feel as if this is the only product in the line that may cause any sort of \'crunchiness\', so be careful with that one. Just don\'t use too much.I will use this line whenever i want to wear my hair curly (which will now be more often) but I will stick with my organic shampoos for all other times.Also, ***side note***, I was due for a trim when i tried this product so the ends of my hair were very frayed, and anyone with curly hair knows that just makes your hair look even MORE frizzy. So i used a dollop of \'nexxus pro mend  leave in treatment creme\' on my ends and...AMAZING! I know it doesn\'t really \'mend\' my split ends, but it does temporarily bind them together making them practically invisible (until i wash my hair again) and cuts down on almost all the frizz, so my ends look awesome. So i suggest adding that to your curly hair routine if you have split ends",
