I have done several hair washes so I could get an idea if the product really worked and I am happy to say it does.  It did give my hair a bit more volume and I am satisfied with that.

I didn\'t realize this was the Curly formula when I ordered it.  My last gem was Sunsilk Volume, which has been reformulated (probably not a word) and my hair now feels like straw.  I gave this a shot and was pleasantly surprised.  It left my hair feeling like it was actually conditioned; silky.

I requested it for my wife who used it and declared it to be a top notch product. She read the claims and found them to be trustworthy.

I want my hair conditioned because it does get dry but I don\'t want it weighted down either so that the natural waves and curl will be there. This does a good job of allowing the curls and it doesn\'t seem to weigh my hair down but I still think that the Hydrating Curls line that pantene has is better than this product. I think it works better with my hair and I use less at each washing than this curly hair series.So while this is a good product the hydrating curls is better for me.",

I have tried many sorts of different products to tryand bring my hair \'back to life\' with no results. I came across the Pantene Pro-V products, and with trial and error I found that the thick-medium flat to volume done the best for me. I had been seeing this tub at walmart for the longest time and actually thought it was a type of vasaline. But after researching it I decided to try it.I can\'t believe how different my hair is. Whenever it\'s down, everyone compliments my hair. It feels so much lighter and the smell stays in longer. My hair has never been this healthy before.For my long hair, I can go through this product pretty quickly, so I limit myself by masagging already dampened strands into dry ones. Apply once a week, s I apply on my day off on Tuesdays, wait until I\'m through with all my house work and work outs, take a shower then apply this and leave it in for a few hours with my hair up.

I recommend it.No allergic reaction thus far.  I have several skin allergies and sensitivities, and have experienced minor problems with a few other shampoos, and not-so-minor problems with several kinds of soap.  I will add a comment to this review if I have a later reaction or other problems.It has made my straight, flat hair look somewhat fluffy; it appears to have more body. Note that this was achieved by merely shampooing, followed by partial drying with a towel; no blow dryer used.The shampoo seems somewhat concentrated, not watered down.  It left my hair and scalp feeling thoroughly clean.  Unlike some shampoos, it has not left my hair feeling as if it were coated with anything greasy or heavy; just clean hair.While shampooing, I noticed only a very subtle scent, that was not specifically feminine nor masculine. It did not leave a noticeable scent my the hair.  A day later, if I bury my sensitive nose in my hair, I can just barely detect a vaguely plant-like scent, gender-neutral.P.S.  My husband also uses this shampoo, and it works well for him too.",

The features of this conditioner are supposed to be as follows:*Volume conditioner contains ultra lightweight conditioning agents that adhere to fine hair, prepping limp strands for lasting volume*Micro-boosters help prepare the structure of fine hair to hold voluminous Styles all day*Gentle enough for color-treated or permed hairDescription is \'Pantene\'s unique volumizing system (Shampoo, Conditioner and Root Lifter Spray Gel) with micro-boosters preps fine hair\'s structure so you can create your volume Style. Now your flat hair looks full again with weightless body and shine.\'I have very very fine hair, so the promise of more volume was too good to pass up. I did not notice any more volume to my hair after using this product. I made sure to not use any other volumizing agents such as gel, or mousse to see exactly how my hair reacted to this conditioner. That said I also live in one of the most humid states in the USA so there is that.EDIT- THis product WRECKED my hair.

I have used this a few times now; one time I let my hair air dry and one time I blew my hair dry. Both times provides the same results - fluffy hair that didn\'t feel weighed down. I like that this is clear shampoo and not gunked up with color/additives. The smell is very nice. I have a sort of bionic nose and can be overwhelmed with scents sometimes, but this shampoo\'s smell is very nice.My hair feels very clean and not overly scented. I love it!

This \'new\' formula leaves my hair dull and super staticky and extremely flyaway...what a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. No volume, no shine, no manageability. My hair is very fine and sensitive, and I must say I settled on the Pantene Volume line after trying a LOT of others...from off the shelf to salon lines. Believe me...been there, done that.How incredibly stupid and short-sighted of Pantene to discontinue this line, and all the others. From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers\' preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...well. Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers. \'Flat\' indeed!!I will now have to stock up on my regular Volume favorites at premium prices from elsewhere and try and find something else that works when that runs out. I am super pissed! Just one more thing that I love, discontinued once again.Once I find a new product line that works, you may rest assured that I will NEVER buy another Pantene product ever again.",

But with my curly, frizzy long hair, almost none of the products, even professional lines, do the job.I saw this cool square jar on the shelf on sale for $4.99 at the grocery store on a very bad hair day and bought it.  I used it the next day and was amazed.  It took the frizz out of my hair and made my hair feel so soft and nice.  It\'s my expectations that with further applications it will only improve my hair.  One thing, however, is that if your hair is really damaged and/or dry/frizzy, then leave it on for 30 min to 1 hour using a shower cap or plastic bag for really deep treatment.  It rivals any other moisturizing treatment that costs up to $50.  A great product at a fantastic price!  Try it.",

I like the smell of the conditioner. I also like the upside down design of the bottle - it is easy to get the conditioner out when the bottle is getting empty.The current price of $11.45 is the best it has been in the last year!

IT IS NOT. If you are looking for the old formula then you need to buy the Pantene Pro-V Restore Beautiful Lengths FRIZZ CONTROL CONDITIONER.

I have compared the ingredients and no matter what Pantene customer service tells you....these products I listed are the actual replacements. Try them you will see.OLD REVEIW:One of the best conditioners you will ever use for damaged hair. I am a professional stylist and have not found any line that works like Pantene Restoratives Time Renewal. Pantene has stopped making many of their products. What a shame.

I have used Matrix Biolage (LOVE the smell, hate the price,) Jason all natural products, Nature\'s Gate all natural products, and a variety of other professional and drug store quality products. Many of these products are good, some don\'t really do much of anything once they\'re rinsed from my hair. Pantene has always worked well for me, and my hair feels drenched in moisture after using this. It never feels greasy, only healthy, and detangled. I would say it\'s one of the top drugstore brands and I could interchange it with any professional product that I\'ve used that has worked well.

Hair looks nice and maintains volume, but almost-daily washing is required because it apparently works by leaving residue on the hair.",

There is nothing truly special about it. The scent is very \'right off the shelf of the drug-store\'. It smells like every other bottle of pantene to me, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing. It is what it is!The conditioner doesn\'t seem to phase my completely unruly, pin straight, fine yet dense hair. I have the strangest hair. Some days it feels very thick and voluminous and others it feels very flat and light. I want a conditioner that adds a nice density to my fine strands but doesn\'t cause my scalp to get oily after a few hours. This doesn\'t do the trick for me.I am also turned off by the fact that this is NOT sls free. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the cheapest method for a company to get it\'s product lathering or textured a certain way and it is literaly the same stuff they use in car wash soaps and degreasing chemicals for car engines. In the same way as it dissolves the grease on the car engines, sodium lauryl sulfate also dissolves the oils on your skin, which can cause a drying effect, which in turn might cause an overproduction of oils, as is my case. It is also well documented that it denatures skin proteins, which causes not only irritation, but also allows environmental contaminants easier access to the lower, sensitive layers of the skin.Products with SLS are not only dangerous for the skin but they can also effect a person\'s hormones and lead to various forms of cancer. So, in the long run, it is better to invest the five bucks you would pay for a tube of this stuff and get something that is CLEARLY marked SLS-FREE. That said, for those less conscious or interested in the harm that SLS can cause...this conditioner will probably be a staple in your shower. It smells fresh and does it\'s job OK for that everyday-pantene price.It\'s not something I would ever buy or endorse though.",
235,239,20100606,B003JA3KDW,4,"June 6, 2010",A3S96B2GBP04N2,Too much perfume but satisfied with it\'s performance,"Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works as advertised. It\'s a nice thick conditioner which controls the frizz and helps to detangle your hair in the shower.My hair type is thick and coarse and naturally wavy and tends to frizz. I usually use a leave in glossing cream after I wash my hair to detangle my hair without breakage and to keep my hair from becoming a frizzy mess.I live in Texas and right now the summer is coming on and it\'s hot and humid so it\'s the perfect recipe for my hair to frizz.The first time I used this conditioner was after swimming and there was no way I could run a comb through my hair without help.  After shampooing with my normal shampoo I was able to detangle my hair using the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner in the shower with no breakage. The conditioner is thick so it coats my hair well while in the shower but it doesn\'t feel as if the conditioner rinses completely out of the hair.However after stepping out of the shower and toweling off the conditioning results weren\'t there and I still felt as I needed something to help comb my wet hair.I believe the reason for this is, is because of one of the ingredients used in this conditioner called \'Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\'.  Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone is a silicone which is used to coat the hair and is not water soluable so it creates the \'conditioning\' feel you feel when in the shower while the water is pouring over your head but once you step out of the shower it doesn\'t feel the same because it leaves a film behind which doesn\'t allow the hair to slide easily between each other.On the other hand the \'film\' Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone leaves behind is suppose to help control frizz which so far it has done well for me.I have used other Pantene daily conditioners before in the past and unless it was a treatment conditioner such as Pantene\'s \'Deep Fortifying\' conditioners then Pantene\'s daily conditioners are usually rather thin and never worked very well .If you have used Pantene\'s treatment conditioners then you have a general idea of the consistency and results of the Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner.The one thing I really did not like is the smell of this conditioner.  The perfume is much stronger with this product than with Pantene\'s other products. It\'s not over whelming but noticeable stronger than another of Pantene\'s product I currently own.I am sensitive to scents so what I feel is too much isn\'t always the case for someone else.  If you are someone who doesn\'t like a lot of perfume you may want to give this product a whiff the next time you are at a grocery store before you purchase it here from Amazon.I do not know if I will continue using this product. This is my third wash using this conditioner and so far I am happy with the results but I\'m sensitive to products which contain sulfates and with anything that leaves a film behind a strong cleaner is definitely needed to help remove build up between uses. If I notice that my non-sulfate shampoos are sufficient in cleaning between conditioning with this  than I\'ll probably stick to using this otherwise I\'ll probably return to my normal routine.In conclusion I give it a 4 stars because I believe that Pantene\'s Pro-v Curly Hair Series Conditioner works well for those battling frizzy hair and after my hair dried it was extremely soft but I don\'t care for the perfume because I feel it\'s too strong.I like to give a Pro and Con breakdown for each of my reviews so here is the list for this one.Pros1. Controls Frizz2. Thick conditioner which helps it stay put where neededCon1.  I don\'t care for the heavy perfume smell",

And it\'s available at a good price.  I don\'t like it as well as my Paul Mitchell shampoo for fine hair.  To be fair, the Pantene Pro-V is much cheaper.My biggest concern may not deter others from liking this shampoo.  While there are a few safe ingredients, I was concerned about a few of the chemicals listed.  I wish manufacturers would also stop adding fragrance.  If deodorant has it, and hair spray has it, and you use perfume, how many fragrances do you need at one time?  But until more women feel this way, companies are likely compelled to add yet one more chemical to the mix.  To be REALLY fair, I would probably go to a store and read the ingredients on a lot more shampoo bottles.  Pro-V may not be any worse than other shampoos.While I am not chemically sensitive, others are.  But these people are probably buying products at the health food store instead of the drug store.  So for the value oriented person who is unconcerned about chemicals, I would say this is a good deal.",

It rinses clear and doesn\'t leave a residue.Although this works well in humidity-I have not had great results in dry weather, especially cold dry weather, with this conditioner.

227,231,20100613,B003JA3KDW,3,"June 13, 2010",A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,"OK conditioner, weird curling results","My hair has a natural wave that is easily coaxed into curls with a little gel or mousse and allowing to air dry.  The Pantene curly hair series conditioner doesn\'t condition my dry ends as much as other conditioners do, but at the same time it didn\'t make it worse as some products have, so I can\'t really complain.The conditioner is quite clingy in the shower, meaning it\'s really hard to massage into the entire length of my hair.  It wants to say where it was first applied, which is quite odd.  It rinses clean and smells nice.  I don\'t use more of it than I do any of Pantene\'s conditioners.When I use the conditioner and just let my hair air dry without product, my hair becomes what I suppose could be called \'curlier.\'  In fact, it\'s as though my hair gets separated out into a series of almost ringlet-like strands.  However, it\'s frizzy, and when I comb through my hair it loses those ringlet things and just becomes a fuzzy bunch of waves.  It is easily tamed by some (other brand) of mild leave-in conditioner and/or spray curl enhancer.  In comparison, I have some Pantene conditioner for dyed hair from their previous series and, while it doesn\'t leave my hair in those ringlet-curls, it also doesn\'t leave my hair frizzy either.When I use the curly hair series conditioner with product in my hair and let it air dry, the hair avoids the ringlet look and turns into what\'s more of an 80s perm, but not frizzy at all.  Combing it out produces a pretty nice series of controlled waves, but there is a tendency to frizz during the day.  Again comparing it with the Pantene conditioner for color-treated hair, it works about the same but provides more controlled waves than the color-treated version does.In all, I personally wouldn\'t buy the curl series conditioner.  Actually, I\'m not sure if I\'d buy any of their product as their current line exists.  See, I\'ve used many Pantene products over the years, and years ago I used Pantene curl products and liked them.  The conditioner was much better than this version; however, Pantene reformulates and repackages their products every few years, which not only means you lose the type of Pantene you liked to use, but also that it\'s hard to stick with Pantene as an overall brand.  I did (and do) continue to use Pantene, always buying whatever series had stronger conditioning than their ever-present Classic Care line.However, with this new series there is no high-conditioning product.  Right now they have Classic Care as they always do, plus curly, color treated, fine hair, medium-thick hair... well, my hair is 3 out of those 4, which do I choose?  I suspect everyone\'s hair falls into more than one of Pantene\'s categories.  It\'s possible there isn\'t a product in their current line-up for me to use, which means I\'ll have to wait 2-3 years until they reformulate yet again.",

It\'s a good conditioner, but is it any better for my hair than say any other Pantene conditioner on the market?  I\'d have to say no.  I can\'t tell the difference between using this formulation or the regular Pantene.  My hair still requires me to put anti-frizz products in it, and it doesn\'t look any different after using this conditioner than another kind quite honestly.But that aside, the reason to buy this particular product is that this DOES leave hair soft and able to be combed right out of the shower (unlike some cheap conditioners) so that is why I give it 4 stars.  I don\'t believe there is any conditioner on the market currently that can truly manage the frizz of curly hair, and probably there never will be.

There\'s a certain segment of the population that perceives a certain elegance, an elan, if you will (or if you won\'t), a panache and flair to products named with a bon mot. Pantene... it sounds elegant(though it has no French meaning--not that it matters) and, by the way, it works pretty darn well.That\'s the most important thing here, Pantene \'FIne Hair SOlutions Flat to Volume\' Conditioner does what it says it will do: Add s bit of of volume (or the appearance of volume) by coating your hair strands, and adding sheen by aligning them.  IT reduce tangles, does not have an unpleasant smell, and basically has a reasonable price. Yes, you can go cheaper, and you might as well give those a try.While we\'re talking about language, what\'s with the name \'Flat to Volume\' --is it an awkward shorthand for \'Your hair looks flat, see, and this stuff will give it VOLUME. Therefore, Flat to Volume!\'  IT might annoy you for a few seconds, or perhaps this is Pantenese, and I\'m the one who should know better.Pantene comes out of the bottle fairly thick, so use just a little. Spread it around your hair, and it becomes much less viscous. I\'d recommend also that you rinse thoroughly.  I thought I detected a slight allergic reaction on my part (some itching) compared to not using it, but this is a tenuous connection and may have nothing to do with the product.  However, like all beauty/cosmetic products, it\'s probably better to buy ONE of these first to determine whether you have any adverse reactions.  Bottom line: I\'d buy it again, but it didn\'t blow me away either.  If you\'re not happy with the conditioner you use now and you tend towards the thin hair end of the follicle spectrum, then this is certainly worth a try. Bon chance a vous!

She seemed happy with it -- no complaints, no raving about her sudden boost in volume either.One of the selling points of this shampoo is a focus on removing oils in the hair, which weigh it down. It\'d probably pay off to make sure you\'re conditioning after using this shampoo, even if you have relatively oily hair (as I do).

I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick.As for volumizing properties, my hair didn\'t go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it\'s making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer.The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day. So if you are going to try this shampoo, you should definitely purchase the matching conditioner to keep the tangles at bay.Overall, I\'d say I am satisfied with this shampoo. It offers great cleansing, a mild floral scent, and modest volumizing properties. For those who say that it is too expensive, you can easily buy an off brand version of this at just about any grocery or superstore for about two and a half dollars a bottle.",

I have used every really good shampoo for fine hair for several decades, so I have many different shampoos to compare this one to.After using Pantene\'s Pro-v for a few days, I am extremely impressed with it having all the great qualities that I require from a really good fine hair shampoo. The first thing I look for is a totally clear shampoo, because if you can see through it, it\'s not going to weigh down your fine hair, and this Pantene Pro-v is perfectly crystal clear. It has a lovely, very faint light citrus smell, which I like, as I don\'t like shampoo smells to clash with my favorite fragrances. It cleans really well and leaves your fine hair full of body and lift, which is exactly what a great fine hair shampoo should do.The main difference I noticed between my shampoo and this Pantene Pro-v is that Pantene Pro-v cleans really well, as in thoroughly super clean, leaving my hair much fuller with absolutely nothing weighing it down. When your hair is that clean, it\'s very important to use a good conditioner to replace lost moisture. Fine hair needs a very special type of conditioner that will not weigh hair down and flatten it, and the best conditioner I have ever found is one that rinses out minutes after it is put on after shampooing.This is a lovely light scented shampoo that cleans extremely well and leaves your fine hair feeling light, full and bouncy. Just remember to use a really good rinse-out, daily-use conditioner as this lovely 5 Star shampoo leaves your hair really squeaky clean!",

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos",

In this case, the product produce frizziness in both hot humid New Jersey weather and in hot dry New Mexico weather.As a result, we both tend to stick with the same conditioner and work around any problems that local conditions produce.

But for my daughter (10 year-old) and myself... meh.I mean I\'ve used it on my daughters fine hair and my own grizzled hair and while it maintains the curl for awhile, it\'s doesn\'t seem to hold up all day.  (I\'m using a curling iron in both instances)The foam itself is dense and dries quickly.  This is something of a concern for me because I\'ve read that quick drying products usually have a lot of alcohol, and alcohol as you know tends to be drying and hard on hair.  In any case, I generally like Pantene products.  We use their shampoo and conditioner and hairspray, but this product isn\'t quite enough to get anything like a rave review from me.Pam T~mom/blogger",

It is easy on the senses -- smells great, smooth, and not a lot of mess.  I put it in my hair after shampooing at the beginning of my shower -- then kept it on until I was done -- probably about five to ten minutes.  Upon drying my hair or rather, styling it and damp drying it, the results were immediate.  I have bouncy and fun curls that aren\'t frizzy and are easy to manage.I will definitely continue to use this conditioner.  I loved it.Natalie S.",

I have fairly thick hair that I keep mine cut short so if Pro-v was going to give my hair volume I would hardly notice. Overall I was pleased with the shampoo and it literally left my hair squeaky clean. I\'m not sure if that\'s necessarily a good thing since according to my wife that squeak is caused when shampoo strips the oil from your hair. I needed to continue to use my Head and Shoulders occasionally because the Pro-v doesn\'t seem to help with dandruff. The Pro-v was fine but I didn\'t notice a huge difference with other shampoos.,

I also live with a finicky man so I knew that whatever I buy, he would use too. Lets just say, if they made a 4-in-1 anything, he\'d be the first to buy. So I decided to go with this low maintenance 2-in-1 Classic Care, we both have fine hair so I didn\'t want to pick anything that would weigh it down. Needless to say, every day has been a good hair day with great-smelling bounce, wave, and volume; and the man is happy because he has one step to worry about. I will say that dryness has been an issue, as my hair feels like straw. The biggest downside to Pantene is that it contains loads of sulfates, which is the same ingredient in many grease-cutting detergents. I will buy this shampoo again, because it is easy and produces good looking results, but I will most likely supplement with a higher cost shampoo that has lower sulfates and more softening ability.",

(No More Snow In June.)","I look good in black, but I avoid wearing solid black shirts because of my problem with dandruff.  Within a few hours of putting on a black shirt, it looks as if snow has fallen on my shoulders.  Thankfully, I don\'t have black hair.  However, I do have thin, flat, greasy hair which requires that I wash it every night.  A few weeks ago, I wore my favorite black Dockers shirt to work and a friend gave me (much to my annoyance) a lesson on how to wash my hair.  I know how to wash my hair.  At choir practice, another friend embarrassed me when he said (loud enough for everyone to hear) that I had dandruff on my shoulders and needed Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Head and Shoulders contains a lot of detergents that can actually be harmful to your scalp.  It was a godsend when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the shampoo and conditioner from the new line of Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume products.  I have faithfully used the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks.  However, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my dirty blonde hair within just a few days.  First, allow me to briefly describe how I use the product.  Every morning I take a shower before going to work.  I lather my hair with the shampoo, gently but thoroughly massaging my scalp for a few minutes with my finger tips.  After I rinse, I apply the conditioner in a like manner.  I allow it to saturate my scalp while I use a wash cloth to lather my body with soap.  Eventually I rinse away the soap and conditioner.  I\'d also like to say that a few drops of shampoo and conditioner go a long way.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a light fragrant smell that is flowery.  I like it.  Sometimes, during the day, especially when I am walking, I can smell it.  It is very light and refreshing.  Not overpowering.  Also, I\'ve noticed that my hair is shinier and has more body.  My hair also seems to stay cleaner for a longer period of time.  The scalp in the back of my head would sometimes itch before I went to bed; also, my scalp would itch if I didn\'t immediately wash it the next morning.  On Saturdays, I may not wash my hair until the afternoon.  By that time, my scalp would start to drive me crazy with itching.  Surprisingly enough, my scalp no longer itches.  Most importantly, I can wear my black Dockers shirt without fear that someone will want to give me a lesson on how to wash my hair or announce to the world that I have snow on my shoulders.  The design of the shampoo and conditioner bottles are very atheistically pleasing and economically practical, especially that of the conditioner.  The shampoo bottle is clear plastic with a white top.  The conditioner bottle has a brown top and a solid white body.  It would be difficult to get the two bottles confused.  Also, they are made to stand upon their lids.  Therefore, it is always easy to get the fluid to come out.  No more squeezing the tube to get that last few drops.  The liquid is always there at the user\'s disposal.  If you have thin, drab, greasy hair that is hard to manage and is prone to dandruff (in other words, the worst type of hair that God can give you except no hair at all), then I highly recommend using the shampoo and hair conditioner from Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume.  In fact, I have recommended this new line of Pantene products to a friend of mine at work who uses the formula for colored hair.  Furthermore, I\'m throwing my old shampoo and conditioner away and using the Pantene shampoo and conditioner because I love my new hair.  No more snow in June.Joseph B. Hoyos",
