6164,2472,20100116,B004B8AZH0,5,"January 16, 2010",A3FCG8UXEV0OPD,Close shave and easy on face,I used the Gillette Sensor 2 blade razor for years. Gives an excellent and as close a shave as possible but not easy on skin; left it chronically slightly rough. The 3 blade Mach 3 was as good but couldn\'t shave under nose closely. The Fusion solved both problems. Shaves as close as the Sensor and has the single edge to shave under nose. And it is very easy on skin of face. The Fusion lasts a month shaving once a day; I\'ve timed several blades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6284,2594,20061106,B004B8AZH0,4,"November 6, 2006",AN9Q4QY93VLLF,"Finally, something worth upgrading to","I still believe that Gillette has not done anything spectacular since the Sensor razor blade.  All the upgrades since just seemed more gimmicky to me (lotion pad that wears after 2 uses, extra blade that makes the razor too big), and based on previous changes I would have ignored this one. However I got the razor and 1 blade free in the mail and gave it a try.  I have been using the same blade for 4 weeks now and I love this thing.  I feel like that thing performs wonderfully well.  The shaves are close and it has minimized the need for shaving in reverse which i need to do.  Also i feel that the strips on this last longer because i still get that squeeky clean and smooth feeling each time.  Another big plus is how easily the hair is cleaned from this blade.  The running water removes all hair thanks to the design that leaves the front and back of the blades fully exposed.  I must say that this product exceeded my expectations.  However, i have taken off a star due to its expensive blades (almost $3.50 per blade, retail). When i go back to my original shaving system, i will decide if this price is worth paying but somehow i doubt it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, I have discovered that it has a serious design flaw that the orginal didn\'t have.  Both of my razors broke in the middle of the handle.  The orginal Venus had hard plastic that went from top to bottom.  The Divine has hard plastic that goes a couple inches down from the top and then it stops and has a rubber piece that comes up from the bottom.  Then has a few more inches of the hard plastic.  Both of the razors that I had broke right in the middle where the hard plastic was missing.

At this price you can\'t find a better quality trimmer let alone a razor as well. No cheapo plastic. It has a little weight to it and the rubberized grip feels great in your hand. The snap on combs aren\'t made of brittle plastic and have a bit of flex. The base that holds it all is well designed to actually hold everything securely. The trimmer works well and didn\'t pull any hairs on my beard and the fusion razor is well... a fusion razor. We\'ll see how it stands the test of time. Finally a trimmer that won\'t sit on the shelf. Well worth the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2151,1060,20080421,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 21, 2008",A105E427BB6J65,Women and Venus Again,"Gillette\'s Venus Embrace Razor is a winner in my book.  For someone who dreads shaving because every excursion results in a bloody nick, this razor changed my view entirely.The handle attaches to the head at the bottom, leaving the head to swivel naturally with each body curve.  Most razors have the handle attaching at the top of the razor so mobility is limited.For the first time since I started shaving my legs, I did not come away with nicks, cuts, or scrapes.  The multiple blade head seems to float over the turns and curves of the body and gives a close shave with little pressure.I also liked the enclosed shower pod which holds the additional blades and keeps them dry yet handy.  Nothing worse than having to leave the shower to get a new razor.  The pod has stuck in its original place so I haven\'t had problems with it falling off the tile as have other reviewers.Overall, there isn\'t anything I can say that I didn\'t like.  So, for women who have tried waxing, lotions, or other razors, give this a try.  I don\'t think you\'ll be disappointed.  No fuss, straight forward and no PAIN!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2060,967,20080405,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 5, 2008",AWIF8AR75LL9L,So Far It Is A Great Razor,"One problem I have with razors is that the multiple blades tend to clog quickly, making shaving nearly impossible after the first few strokes.This Venus razor seems to do a good job so far- I find that the blades empty out pretty well so far when rinsed.The shaving head glides over the skin very easily and smoothly with no tugging or frustration.  The little rubbery fins seem to keep the head moving at a good pace with no problems so far.  It is flat and hugs the skin well and seems to rotate well without difficulty.I will keep using it and testing it, but I am not sure how expensive the replacement blades are- that is often the problem.  So many times the replacement blades are more expensive than the original razor or close to it.The handle was easy to hold on to despite soapy wet hands.  The wall unit  stayed up well so far on my fiberglass shower wall- it has two suction cups which seems a bit better than other ones I have tried with only one.The extra blade pack stores inside which I like, although it has to be cut into with scissors to get at it, so having it in the shower helps to keep track of it, but not for opening when needed.  You have to get out of the shower to open it.All in all I really like this razor so far- I have used it twice on my legs and it has stayed sharp and effective, but I will edit if I can in the future to reflect any changes in my opinion of this as time goes on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

The difference between the two is pretty significant. These are more expensive that the Sensors are but they last you forever. I found I got maybe 4 or 5 shaves max out of the old Sensor where I can use these blades for a good month and a half before I feel the need to replace them. The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.The comfort of the blade is by far the best I\'ve experienced. It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.The blade on the back I have found to be very useful which is something that, if I remember correctly, the Sensor doesn\'t even have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6455,2769,20110322,B004QE83VE,2,"March 22, 2011",A1VABWDOUQLULZ,Don\'t buy the hype,"I\'ve used razors in the Venus line off and on for years, as well as other brands that have built-in moisturizers, so I was curious when I saw Gillette had created the \'Pro Skin\' razor.  There are two cartridges in the package, along with the razor handle and suction shower hook.  The hook fastened well to my glass shower, and has clung since without problem.  The tortoise shell packaging has an easy-open flap in the back, which is nice.  I find the individual packaging of the cartridges a bit overkill, but I\'m not a big fan of packaging, in general.The cartridges slip onto the handle easily enough.  I noticed right away that the installed cartridge is a bit bulky. After dampening it, I found the blades were quite sharp, leaving a smooth, close shave.  My dislike of the Pro Skin razor is that it doesn\'t shave curved areas well, because it\'s so bulky you can\'t shave tight areas, and the gel bars drooled.  They were kind of gross, actually, and dripped down the handle of the razor.  That said, the gel bars left my skin soft and feeling as if I\'d put on lotion.  If you don\'t enjoy that sensation, these razor won\'t be your favorite.  By the time I had completed shaving the bars had worn down quite visibly.  I expect the Pro Skin will suffer the fate of other such inventions, which is the bars will wear down far in advance of the blades becoming dull.  Also, I can\'t imagine storing the razor any way other than on the shower hook.  It would leave a terrible mess laying flat.In short, it does a great job shaving, but for the mess and bulk of the gel bars I won\'t be running out to buy one.  If you need a smaller razor, stick to the original Venus.  If you need a moisturizing razor, spend the extra $4 and get the Intuition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really don\'t remember when I last used a single blade.  I think that\'s why I dislike shaving. Oww, yes, it\'s that old-time razor burn in spades.So after any shave you can contrast the burn beneath your nose with the smooth, closely-shaved, unharmed skin on the rest of your face.After their big-buck R & D efforts, Gillette needs a way to solve this.(Or use a Mach III under your nose and the new Fusion  on the rest of your beard.)BTW, somehow they seem to have solved the clogged-blade problem that haunted the 4-bladed Shick Quattro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn\'t waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3\'s were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I\'ve had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an \'upgrade\' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you\'re handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, \'What were they thinking?!\' crosses my mind.  I\'ve discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3.

The razors were ordinary razors, from Gillette. Those razors don\'t come into this tale. But attached to the outside of the pack of ordinary razors was one special razor, a sample of another razor model. This is its story.At first, the special razor lay in the bathroom drawer, watching as ordinary razors were used and thrown away, used and thrown away. It was a lonely existence as the only one of its kind. No bright colors or fancy features made this razor stand out from the crowd. Razors came and razors went as the tough-bearded man shaved his sensitive face.Then one day it was the special razor\'s turn.The first shave was fine, a nice close shave that didn\'t sting that sensitive face. It might even have ended that day, if the rough-bearded man had thrown the special razor in the trash. But he didn\'t, for he was frugal too.The second shave was fine as well.And the third. Unusual, thought the rough-bearded man.But the fourth time he shaved his sensitive face with the special razor is when he began to suspect that this razor was special, indeed. What razor stays sharp for four shaves? And a disposable too! The man felt his smooth skin and wondered if it could be. He set the razor aside just in case, on the slimmest hopes there could be another smooth shave. How wonderful, how magical that would be!The next day came, as they always do. And the rough-bearded man lifted the special razor to his sensitive face. And shaved.No pulling! No stinging! A smooth and silky shave! It was all true. Then the rough-bearded man knew that this was not merely a special razor. Nay, this was indeed -- a Magic Razor!He asked the razor its name. The razor said, \'Gillette Custom Plus 3 Sensitive\'.The rough-bearded man with the sensitive face smiled a wide smile with his smooth skin. Some say the razor smiled too.The End",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve been using this razor for several months, after waiting to hear from others just how well it works.  I have a fairly tough turf, shaving only MWF, resting on the weekends.  Up until this point, I liked Sensor Excel best, and detest every electric unit I\'ve tried. Since I really like the razor, I was surprised by some of the low rankings. I use Edge gel with extra lubricants, and I shave in the shower (yes, these things make a huge difference).Pro:-Blade life appears improved over my Sensor Excel-Vibrating handle not a gimmick, works well once you get used to it. Initially I found a lack of my normal \'feel\' when shaving, but quickly adapted-A beefy well-weighted handle with a secure seal for the battery.  Other razors have popped apart with the blade flying off on me if I dropped them, but not this one.  My Sensor Excel was notorious for this.-Large blade \'eject button\' is nice, yet doesn\'t let the blade pop off prematurely (see above)-The \'hole\' in the handle head is great! I have a wire rack that holds my shampoo and soap.  This same rack has a few \'hangers\' that this razor slides onto nicely-Very good battery life (still on the first one months later)-Plastic holder has a bigger \'foot\' to stay upright better and it\'s easier to see at a glance how many blades that I have left due to the clear sides, a feature that my Sensor lacks-On/off button flashes when battery gets low... hard to miss and allows you to get a least one shave-Best for last: a very close shave on a very tough faceCon:-Razor head is large, single blade on the back is a good idea and is sharp, but I can\'t seem to make it work as good as it sounds. It\'s a first generation idea that I am hoping gets some refinement.-Price... Ouch! Fewer blades per pack AND much more expensive. Buy in bulk, look for sales, save coupons-Plastic tray is much larger than my Sensor yet holds fewer spare blades (4).-Old blades from Sensor are not compatible with Fusion (you can mitigate this problem by taking your old shaver to work for those embarrassing days when you miss a small spot)Bottom line: Recommended if you\'ve got a rough face! Doing it all over again, I would buy it again.

I suppose there is a degree of subjectivity involved when you make a comparison with fresh blades. I remember that Consumer Reports was unimpressed with the vibrating Fusion when it came out, but I got one right away and liked it--even while aware that each \'improved\' razor came with ever-more expensive blades.Now there is the Fusion Proglide Power Razor. It makes claims of important improvements on what I would have thought was unimprovable--after all it is just a razor with a new generation (it claims) of blades.So the question is this: is there a positive difference?I read the information that came with the razor and on the web and was impressed by Gillette\'s audacity (for instance, a circuit board to keep an even flow of juice to the vibrator motor even as the battery runs down, and special groves to feed whiskers into the onrushing blades as the user draws the Fusion Proglide across a cheek!).I figured to keep it simple: fresh blades in my current Fusion and in the Fusion Proglide, one for each cheek; four down strokes over gel shaving cream on the left cheek for the Fusion and four more on the right for the Fusion Proglide. Little did my familiy know that my morning routine had become a major evaluation activity.Well, there is a difference.

The Fusion  has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days\' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I used the Venus razor, it felt like it was wiping hair away. And I have a very thick beard. I have to go over an area twice, at least, after my Mach3 razor is on its first or second use.  The Venus created no problems at all, even after several uses. There was no irritation, no cuts, and nothing missed. Just total, smooth comfort.

I prefer the multi-blade razors as they always seem to do a better job and the best I have used so far it this Gillette Fusion.  The five blade head shaves my face smooth on the first pass and I do not have to often reshave an area over.  Multiple shaving over the same place tends to give me razor burn.The flexible head follows the contours of my face and always keeps the blades at the proper angle for a clean close shave.  The single blade side is good for trimming my side burns and my mustache.  I also like the Lubrastrip and when it is gone it is about time to change blades.  It is a good indicator of the razors usage.The grip elastomer coating on the handle makes it nice to shave with as you can get a firm grip on the razor even with wet and soapy hands.  Overall it is a good design and it works well for me! I get a close comfortable shave.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

I laughed when I heard Gillette was coming out with a razor with 5 blades but it didn\'t surprise me. This is the best shave I have ever had. The 5 blades glide across the face without friction or burn and the shave feels effortless.  The 6th single blade is gimmicky but good for what it is for...under the nose and sideburns.  I cringed when I saw the cost of replacement blades but buy your blades on EBAY and save lots of money.

When I started, I just used the same blades I was using on my face: Gillette Sensor. Every once in a while, I try something new. Perhaps it\'s in my christmas stocking. Maybe it\'s on super sale. Maybe it\'s all I can find at Costco. Regardless, they have all been failed experiments and I must go back to the plain, old Sensor.Sensor Excel. Quattro. Mach 3. I have tried many things. What do all of these (and many more) have in common? They all have the little rumble strip before the blades. The rumble strip (i\'m sure there is a more formal name) probably results in a smoother shave for many people, but for me the result is simply a bloody head.If Gillette every stops making these, I don\'t know what I will do.

Oh well, on to the Fusion.I really cannot tell a difference in the quality of shave between the Fusion and the M3.  I agree with another reviewer, if all things are apparently equal why spend the extra money?One drawback to the Fusion is that it is hard to clean thick shaving cream out of it.  I\'m not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick.  I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it.  Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out.  I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades.  Either way it annoys me.To sum it up...sure it\'s a good razor, but it seems more novelty than anything else.  The M3 is good enough for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4252,1634,20090428,B001JQLNFA,3,"April 28, 2009",A2VZP50FSYD6CO,Unique Razor,"Venus Spa Breeze Razor has a unique feature - shave gel bars at the top and bottom of the razor that eliminate the need for shaving cream. It comes with a handle and two razor cartridges. The razor handle will hold all Venus razor cartridges, not just the Spa Breeze ones. The entire package was very easy to open and the razor handle and cartridges come in a nice waterproof container that can be stored in the shower, although it\'s not all that sturdy. The package comes with a bracket so you can hang the razor in the shower, however, I couldn\'t figure out how to use it. While the razor cartridge packages are conveniently waterproof, I had a hard time opening them and ended up having to use scissors, which damaged the shaving gel bar a bit.The Venus Spa Breeze Razor was just okay. I love the fact that there is a scratch and sniff panel on the front of the package so you can smell the shaving gel to see if you like the odor and the white tea scent was very pleasant. You need to be careful how you store the razor in the shower especially if you can\'t figure out how to hang it - put the razor face down and the shave gel bars are activated and the razor becomes messy to use. The handle fits pleasantly into the hand and the cartridges snap on and off quite easily. The shaving gel bars are a unique feature and work quite well, but don\'t expect lather like from regular shaving cream. The razor provides a nice smooth shave although I did knick myself a bit, causing my leg to bleed.Venus Spa Breeze Razor is an interesting concept that is perfect for people that may be traveling and don\'t want to pack shaving cream. However, I\'m not sure how long the shave gel bars last, which makes me a bit wary. In the end, I prefer regular razors and shaving cream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All you want to know is does it smell good, and does it control your sweating or at least keep it to a minimum? Well you don\'t have to worry about body odor. It has a nice, clean smell that is not overpowering. As for sweating, I live in AZ and we are already hitting 100+ degree weather and by around the afternoon I was sweating. So if you live in weather that barely hits 90 degrees, then you will probably be fine. The one bonus with this is that it does not stain your shirt which I find to be a major plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Closer shave than the Mach 3, and less irritation under the neck.  Here\'s a tip that will save you much money.  I used to get only about 2 weeks works of shaves on the Mach 3.  Years ago, I read an article in Fortune magazine that you can extend the life of a blade by spraying the product \'Clean Shower\' (by Arm and Hammer) after each use.  As a result, I now get 2 months of shaves per blade on both the Mach 3 and now the Fusion.  Really helps since the cost of Fusion blades are so high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do not buy!,"I happen to suffer from three things that my wife described until 5 years ago a hughe problem; 1) Extremely sensitive skin, 2) Very (and I men VERY) thick facial folicules, and 3) Keloid cicatrization.I solved my problems through trial and error (which means many cuts and sores!) and different blades and gel trials, I went from shick, wilkison blades, remignton, braun (Electrical) to gillette. And I came to always the same results, cut, burn, soring, irritation, razor burn, you name it I had it, and you can guess, many scars, which made the opperation of shaving worse every morning. The gel to keep it short I went from clinique to gillette and always the same result.  I was using one blade that made shaving more tolerable gillette\'s sensor excell when my wife arrived from one of her shopping errands and presented me with what came to be my salvation for the next four years, the mach3, which I put together with the Neutrogena sensitive skin gel and clinique\'s aftershave balm and the rest is history. Then I reluctantly accepted my wife\'s new present the Mach3 Power, and voila! My perfect match I haven\'t been this happy in years, comfy with minor irritation and no cuts for months! Until last week! When I felt so confident and adventurous about gillette\'s new product, I spotted it cueing in the supermarket and thougt \'It\'s gillette! More blades, better shave, what can go wrong?\' Well, when I arrived home my wife told me, that machine looks mean, and I replied, yes and I hope its mean with my beard and gentle with my skin, we shared a laugh. Next morning I went to the bathroom and started sahving, one pass, second pass, not bad... third pass... slash, hughe, and I mean big, cut just on the border of my mandible! I was pulling down when this happened! I was being extra careful due to the sharpness of new blades. It peeled off about 3/8\' by almost 2\' of my skin, I have only seen this kind of surgical precision on dermatomes! It took me eons to stop the bleeding. You can imagine my dismay, I got my refund and be done with it for good!Why can\'t Gillette just have a mach3 power with the nice features of battey indicator and the chip set as well as a more powerfull motor? That would work perfectly for anybody, hell... I would buy it, eventhough their product slashed my chin open!P.S. My wife told me \'I told you it looked mean\' I did not laugh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

Then I bought a Gillette manual fusion and stopped laughing.  It was awesome with closer shaving and the blades lasted one month for me!So I just purchased the Proglide Power Razor.  My \'qualified 5 star rating\' is given because the improvement of this razor over my first 5 blade manual Gillette is no where near the improvement seen in moving from the 3 blade to 5 blade system.  There is no night and day difference.  I would not be surprised if the razor by Gillette testing is an improvement.  But the difference I believe is too small to discern for an average user.  It may come down to whether you like the vibration.  I will say that I have not determined if the vibration helps prevent the buildup of hair between the blades which is feasible.  Nevertheless, I love this razor.  It is entirely optional whether you use the power capability or not.  And relative to my older manual 5 blade the handle on this Proglide is much more rounded and comfortable.  It is not heavy at all and in fact is likely very light yet solid if you remove the battery. So I would recommend giving it a try and figure out for yourself how you prefer to use it.  My one caveat at for this early review is that I have not been able to determine how long the blades last but do not expect that to be significantly different, and if I am not mistaken the older blades still fit as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

5876,2182,20101119,B003987CL0,1,"November 19, 2010",A2CQSOOMJQJHKA,one star for outrageously expensive razor blades,"This is an excellent razor for times when you need a good shave quickly.  The Gillette multiblade systems are very forgiving of rushed shaving, and truly do a pretty good job.  That said, I\'d need to be able to shave in a tenth of a second to justify $3.50 or more per cartridge.  Seriously, Gillette?For times when you have a little more time to shave, I\'d recommend a good old-fashioned safety razor.  With a little more time for shaving, and a little attention to technique, you can get shaves with an old safety razor that are as good or better than anything you can do with a Gillette Fusion.Besides having razor blades that cost a tenth as much as the Fusion cartridges, a classic styled Merkur safety razor is a solid, well-made tool.  Much more satisfying to use than anything made of plastic.  And a puck of good quality shaving soap might cost $10 or less, and it will last you an entire year.  To top it all off, safety razors are more environmentally sound than the plasticky Gillettes.  No pressurized metal cans of goo, and the double-edged blades are inexpensive to manufacture and to purchase.More tips:  Proraso shave cream in the green metal tube is the best.  Gillette 7 o\'clock sharp edge double edge blades (made in Russia) are great and inexpensive - $34 for  100 at the time of this review.  I\'ve been using a Merkur model 180 for five years now, and love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

5550,1850,20110602,B003983HRI,4,"June 2, 2011",A2PFX6WO88KTYB,"Smooth razor, but doesn\'t last long","The feel of the razor is very smooth at first, but I\'ve noticed that the life of the razor is relatively short compared to other brands out there. Either way, I bought this on sale for 73 cents! So I can\'t complain too much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5561,1861,20110307,B003983HRI,4,"March 7, 2011",A2JN24Z1N2WU02,Best shave I\'ve had so far.,"I was sick of being in constant pain during and for a while after shaving. This handy little shaver actually took away the hair without giving me razor burn that people could see visibly from across an eight-lane highway. I also like how the grip is made of something other than low grade plastic. The only thing I don\'t understand is the single blade they put on the back, I tried using it for it\'s intended purpose of killing your mustache but it was not doing anything. This is definitely worth consideration, if you won\'t but it online you should consider clipping a coupon as this razor does cost twice as much in a store.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,65,20111028,B000052YIN,1,"October 28, 2011",A195XNI4FY2KQZ,A complete lack of quality control. The foam is too watery.,"I\'ve been using this product and its predecessors for a very long time. A few years ago I noticed that some batches were too watery. Now it looks like seven-eight cans out of ten contain foam that is so runny that it\'s hardly usable. I suspect they have changed ingredients, and this reflects in the profound drop of the product quality. Why it wasn\'t picked up by their QC department and corrected remains a mystery to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything.  LOVE the vibration - it feels like I\'m NOT shaving.  No razor bumps.  I couldn\'t be happier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2375,1288,20111029,B001E5E9RK,4,"October 29, 2011",A2IKS5HMNMK5LB,GOOD STUFF,Yeah I just tried a can and it works pretty good but i got lucky getting mine at the local Dollar Store on sale tho I prefer to buy from Amazon when i can.No to tell the truth it DOESNT shave as good or as close as Musgo Real or Proraso but it\'s the best so far of all the Foams I\'ve tried and while it\'s not barber shop quality its not far behind so if you want a good Quick Shave with a blade then this may be a good way to go.OH yeah to the guys who griped about the price.Either buy the 12 packs from Amazon or wait for a sale at your local Dollar Store!.Yeah I used to gripe too until I learned to watch for the discount sales and from then on I became a power buyer.Believe me it works.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5831,2136,20111115,B003987CL0,5,"November 15, 2011",A35C1Y3Z0HWAU0,Baby Skin Smoothness,"I really believe the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor I have ever used. I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn. Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head. I have been shaving my head for 10 years and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head, I couldn\'t believe how baby skin soft my head felt. Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head. I shave my head once a day and sometimes twice. On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times. I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried. I have had no razor burn or cuts with this Power Proglide razor.  I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush. I can honestly say that there is not too much difference with using these shaving gels/soaps with the Gillette Power Proglide.The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin. I can usually get about 5 complete head shaves (several times with the grain and against the grain) and beard shaves  with one razor before I need to replace it. The trimmer is quite helpful to trim around and outline my beard, goatee, mustache and even the occasional eyebrow. The only negative for this razor is the price.If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two \'shave gel bars\' do the job nicely, providing just enough lather to smooth your shave. The green tea scent fades pretty quickly (after a few uses), but that wasn\'t a concern.I\'ve used other Venus razors before, and my favorite is still the 5-blade Venus Embrace. But the Spa-Breeze, seems to be a less expensive and even \'Green\' alternative, thanks to the fact that I can use it without shave cream.The 5-blade embrace does deliver a slightly closer shave, but I\'d still say the Spa Breeze is worth a try if you\'re not \'addicted\' to a 5-blade razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5653,1955,20101118,B003983HZK,4,"November 18, 2010",A1BYPTZE0GHB41,as compared to Gillette Fusion,The blades shave better after the first or second use than they do just out of the packaging. I also think the blades give a more comfortable shave for a longer period of time. It\'s questionable if they give any closer a shave than the regular fusion but both are very close so I wasn\'t dissapointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It shaves really smooth and I have yet to nick or cut myself with it. My only complaint is that the razor can be a little messy with the moisture bar as it has a tendency to get gooey and slimy while using it. I\'m always sure to rinse it off good and give it a really good shake before I put it away to make sure it\'s mostly dried off. I don\'t store the razor in the shower where the water will hit it constantly or it would eat away the moisture bar in no time. I shave my legs every other day and this razor seems to do a really good job at shaving close and keeping my legs looking good for the time between shaving. Overall, I\'m happy with this razor and might even buy some refills on my own when I\'m done using up what came with the razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This size package offers the lowest cost per blade.  However, whenever Gilette brings out newer (and ever higher-priced)products, suddenly, the sharpness of the older blades seems to go downhill.  This is obviously designed to drive consumers toward the newer shaving systems.  Being an older guy, I\'ve seen this happen time and again.  Suddenly, the blades you have been using for years are duller and don\'t hold their edge as well.  You move up to the newer shaving system to get back to the old comfort level, at a higher price.  Then, the cycle eventually repeats itself.  I am sticking with the M3Power blades as long as they are available, because the newer system is still more expensive and doesn\'t give me any better a shave.  I am just hoping that the sharpness and longevity of these blades doesn\'t go down any farther.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4263,1645,20090423,B001JQLNFA,4,"April 23, 2009",A23GFTVIETX7DS,"Great for travel, works as advertised, but . . .","The Gillette Venus Breeze is a lightweight, three-bladed razor with solid lubricant that obviates the need for shaving cream or shower gel.  All you have to do is wet it and begin shaving since the soap-like pieces above and below the blades turn to a clear substance the consistency of (sorry!) mucous as you shave.  The handle is molded to fit comfortably in your hand, although the weight feels more like a disposable.This pack comes with two sealed blades -- airtight so as not to dry out the lubricant.  Herein lies the first problem:  instead of a neat row of blades in a small holder, you get individual pods.  For this reason, the packaging is bulky, and it seems like a very non-green approach to razor blades.I use a Gillette Quattro as my primary blade, so I compared the two.  I used the Venus Breeze without soap of any kind, and I used the Quattro with my usual Dove Body Wash.  The Quattro shaved slightly closer, although this wasn\'t obvious until the second day.  My skin was noticeably drier on the Venus Breeze leg, however.  The best news is that the lubricant worked since I had no razor burn or other discomfort while shaving.I recommend this razor primarily for travel when you don\'t want to take cream or gel for shaving and you can pop a pod into your bag.  Because the lubricant is solid, you don\'t need to put anything in the airport carry-on quart size bag, which frees up more room for other items.This razor works exactly as advertised, although I suspect it will end up because more expensive than most choice simply because of the cost of replacement blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

It cleans well enough for my skin--which is relatively dry--and has never caused me any irritation, including on my face.  I like the smell a lot, and so does my wife.  The only caveat I would note--and the reason for not giving it five stars--is that the product will stain wash cloths, sponges, poufs, etc. a blue color, sort of like liquid fabric softener does.  These will wash out in the washer.  It can be a nuisance, but not enough to prevent this from being my favorite body wash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which is why I was skeptical when I heard there was a 5 blade razor on the market.  In short, I was \'blown away\' by this razor\'s performance and longevity of the blades!  I have a very tough and thick, fast growing beard, and this 5 blade easily beats the performance of a 2 or 3 blade razor.  My shaves are faster and closer, and the trimmer blade really comes in handy when trimming the hair by my nostrils, and \'fine trimming\' my sideburns.  In addition, i\'ve had a single cartridge last me 4 months, as long as I rinse it clean after each use!  Talk about \'cost effectiveness\'!

The Sensor3 gives me a closer shave than Excel, though not as close as I had hoped. But there was a definite improvement in comfort. My face is noticeably less irritated with the Sensor3. This comfort factor alone is, to me, worth the additional cost over the Excel.Of course, our faces are all different, and \'your results may vary.\' But I would recommend buying a pack of Sensor3 and trying them out, you may be pleasantly surprised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

I preordered this razor with the hopes it would be better than the original fusion. I am happy to say from my experience that it is to me. This razor has no pull on a three day old beard along with no nicks or cuts, this must be due to the thinner finer blades. This is why they call it the pro glide. The lubrication strip is a lot bigger than the original and the diffrence is slightly noticeable during the shave. There was no stubble left over with a second pass. I have never tried the fusion power due to I feel that it is sort of a gimmic with the vibration in ways that other power razors have cut me or tugged at the beard so I stick with the manual. So far i am very pleased with this razor and even ordered the blade refills already. I will never even look back at my old fusion now due to the upgraded comfort and longer lasting blades of proglide. One reviewer feels that this razor is not much of an upgrade from the original and to stick with the original fusion but I beg to differ strongly. The old fusion is nice but no where compares to the proglide. It is definately worth the almost $11 for the best shave I have found so far!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

The 5 razors there do a good job in removing hair fast.  However, it\'s not necessarily best in giving the closest shave.If you are not a natural \'gorilla\' like myself (moderately thick beard), then this large clumsy unwieldly razor won\'t do much, will cost more, and won\'t even give you the best shave.Truth be told, how many of the 5 razors make a real difference, 3?  The rest do minimal work.Thus, number one for a fast quick good shave, but for a nice excellent shave (take a minute/2 longer and a little more effort), I would choose to stick with the Gillette 2 blade disposables.  I am going to sell my Fusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without this, I can shave in multiple directions (including completely against the grain), and still have annoying stubble from my upper neck to my chin. When I do take time and use this, however, I can get a close shave and get rid of that stubble only going through the area twice with the razor. I don\'t even bother moisturizing my face afterward since this gel does a great job of doing just that. Only complaint is that it has more of a scent/fragrance than I\'d like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the years, as my hair has gotten grayer, my beard has gotten rougher.

I get an incredibly smooth shave that lasts through the day. The vibrating motion from the battery must be the key to such a close shave.

These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.I don\'t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it\'s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I\'ve never had any problems with the handle, and I\'ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.There may be better razors or blades out there, but I\'m content enough with the Mach 3 that I\'ve stocked up on enough to last me for years!If these are inferior knockoffs, I guess I just haven\'t noticed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

176,184,20050221,B000065AB0,3,"February 21, 2005",AF2D2VKWUKHGZ,Not All It\'s Cracked Up To Be,"I used my new Mack 3 Turbo for about 6 months and went through a lot of new blades to be fair in my judgement.  It does shave very close, but not closer the other 3 bladed razors I have used.  After the 6 months of use, I found that it shaved very well until I had to shave over the edge of my jaw and chin where it failed to give a good clean shave right under my jaw-line and chin with the first stroke.  I found if I try to shave closer, I got to many nicks.  I only got a close shave in those areas after I lathered up again and shave agaist the grain, but at times I did get razor burn doing that.  With out question, my old Gillette Sensor Excel with it\'s two blades did a much better job with only one stroke.  The Sensor Excel seems to huge the surface of my face much better, and the Mack 3 Turbo seems not to keep all 3 blade in contact with my skins surface when going over my jaw and chin.  All in all, I would have been happy with the Mack 3 Turbo\'s shave, it\'s great looks, and I really love the new handle.  And most of the time, if I shave slower I got a great shave after lathering up again and shaving against the grain.  However, I was not happy at all with the way the blade got dull so very fast, and there not cheap!  This is by far the biggest disappointment with the Mach 3 Turbo and the reason I give it only 3 stars.  It\'s also the reason I went back to my Sensor Excel until I got my new Gillette Sensor 3.  I think the Sensor 3 shaves just as close at the Mach 3 Turbo and does ever better in the problem areas under the edge of my jaw and chin.  The Sensor 3 blades are about $1.00 less per pack and last much longer then the Mach 3 Turbo Blades.  And one more good thing, I can use both Sensor Excel Blade and Sensor 3 Blade with both my Sensor Excel and new Sensor 3!  I\'ll keep the new Sensor 3 at home, and keep my old Sensor Excel in my travel bag to use on my many camping and fishing trips, vacation or when ever away from home.  I would recommend the Gillette Sensor 3 over the Mack 3 Turbo because of these reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a tough beard and sensitive skin. A bad combination. I bought the Fusion on a whim. I didn\'t expect it to be signficantly better than the previous generation Mach 3 but hope springs eternal. After two weeks and 7-8 shaves with the same cartridge(!), I can wholeheartedly say that this is a very noticeable improvement over the Mach 3. The cartridges have an astounding life. The Mach 3 would give me about 3-4 shaves before the blades dulled enough to result in razor rash. The Fusion has at least doubled that and is still going strong. Amazing. The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if Gillette is using a higher quality steel in the blades for the product launch. Time will tell. Secondly, I get far less razor burn from the Fusion. Almost none actually. Lastly, it\'s more difficult to cut myself in the nose/lip area which was something I had to watch carefully with the Mach 3. I\'d guess this has to do with a larger blade surface area. In short, the Fusion really is an improvement over the Mach 3. As long as the cartridges continue to last for 8-10 shaves each, I will be a loyal customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

More importantly, it hasn\'t caused any skin irritation--unlike many prescription-strength products, it doesn\'t contain the active ingredient, aluminum chloride, which has been known to cause underarm irritation.

Inside the holder is a spare blade, so if you decide it\'s time to change blades, you don\'t have to venture dripping from the shower to find a refill.Yeah, the blades are expensive.

I always though the battery part of the Fusion was pointless, so was the Proglide going to be any better?In a word, no.The overall shave is excellent. I find it slightly smoother and easier on my face than the original Fusion blades, though I still feel the pull and tug around my mouth and just under my chin as I did with the original Fusion blade.But maybe it\'s just me: I do NOT understand the point of a AAA battery to shove in the handle. All it succeeded in doing (very well, I might add) was to make my right hand go numb. NOT fun. I tried with the vibration on and off and detected no difference to the shave except the numbness of my hand.In any case, yes it\'s a better shave than its predecessor, the hair doesn\'t get trapped in the blades as easily either, - but no it\'s not worth the extra cost at this point.

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

I don\'t want to smell like my deodorant, and the Cool Wave fragrance is very subtle. Also, my wife likes the smell, so that is an obvious plus!3) It seems to last longer than other brands including other gels. I tried AXE but found their clear gel to take more layers of application to work with the same effectiveness as Gillette.4) It doesn\'t degrade or melt when taken around in a gym bag. Over time some of the other gels I\'ve bought lose their texture or melt if they\'re not kept cool enough. I don\'t have that problem with Gillette. I can take it to the gym, leave it in my gym bag in a hot car all day long, and it still works perfectly later.Amazon sells these for a very reasonable price compared even with a place like SAMS, so if you like this deodorant, stock up and save some money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I usually bought them at BJ\'s or Costco.  One day I was in Walmart and decided to try their brand (they were cheaper).  Well, after only using the Gillette disposables for all those years, the Walmart blades were pretty bad(cuts, rough, etc.).  Right then I decided to upgrade to a new razor.  After all, it was about time.  As luck would have it, I caught a commercial announcing the new ProGlide was coming on June 6th.  I decided to wait the couple of weeks so I would have the \'latest and greatest\'. Boy, am I glad I did!I wound up picking up the preview kit over Memorial Day weekend.  To say it is a smooth shave is an understatement.  It really does glide over your face.  I loved it so much, I picked up kits for my sons.I was concerned with the cost of the blades, but I\'ve now shaved 8 times on a single blade and my shave this morning was as close and smooth as day one.  My wife now calls me \'Baby Face\' because of how smooth my face feels after shaving. I highly recommend it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At first I thought it was a fluke, but now I know: the blades I purchased from seller bsd sales are counterfeit.  These blades would not stay on either of my Venus razors - the friction from drawing it up my leg was enough to pop it off several times over the course of one shave.  They also did not fit correctly into the plastic they come in; I had to pull the blade out with my fingers instead of pulling it out by the handle like you\'re supposed to be able to do.  Finally, they were so dull that they didn\'t take hardly any hair off of my legs.  I\'ve been using Venus razors for several years now, and I know how sharp they\'re supposed to be out of the box.In conclusion, be careful what you buy.  I know this single one star rating won\'t hurt the popularity of these razors, and it shouldn\'t as they are great razors.  But do be careful who you\'re buying from, because you never know what you\'ll get.(I was unable to give bsd sales a review due to it being more than 90 days since the purchase, but please steer clear of this seller!)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A move comfortable, smoother shave for me. I could hardly feel the silky way it removes hair. I had to check some of the strokes to see if anything was happening. I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal. Fushion is quite a bit better. I was surprised. I like the reverse side feature of one blade for under the nose.

However I have to admit this razor gives a really comfortable shave. The ergonomics are the best I\'ve come across, well balanced, correctly angled head, substantial weight with battery installed.  The five-blade cluster is more than just gimmickry, it provides a wider shaving area, which is more stable as you shave. The vibrating gimmick is just that, however. It seems to add nothing to the shave and it completely eliminates any tactile feedback, which I find necessary for a good shave. New blades are quite expensive, usually $3-$4 each, pretty steep but you may find the comfort of the shave is worth it (I\'m still unsure). To sum up, pass on the powered version and go with the cheaper \'manual\' version and be prepared to pay a lot for new blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

438,448,20080805,B000277P5E,5,"August 5, 2008",A29WWNOYAM96QB,Real Mach3 Turbo razor blades are great! BUT Watch out for fakes!,"First, I want to explain that I gave 5-stars because this is a product review and this product is excellent as a razor blade. HOWEVER, be careful where you buy it from, some sellers especially on ebay and amazon (third parties) are selling FAKE blades. It\'s hard to recognize at first but you can tell from a few things:1. If you are familiar with Gillette shave, you will feel the difference immediately. For example, my one-month old genuine Gillette razor still shaves better than a fake one.2. Lubricating strip on the fake one is not real. So, how do you know it? With real Gillette product you can immediately feel there is a lot of lubricant (a little sticky moisture feeling), BUT with the fake one, your face will feel very dry even when you used the blades for the first time. Because they are not lubricating! They are fake strips and made out of some plastic kind material.3. Even after many months of use, If you try to remove lubricating strip on your real Gillette product, you can see that there is still a lot of lubricant just under the strip and on the strip itself. And this strip is a one piece well-aligned strip, easy to remove and easy to put back. BUT, if you remove the fake one\'s strip, this just plastic kind strip will break into parts and you cannot put it back in place.4. If you have a good eye, look closely to see if all three blades are leveled and adjusted as parallel to each other. Usually, on the fake ones, you will see a slight misalignment, basically they are out of line and think about it, what it can do to your face. Check all the blades in the box individually. None of them should be misaligned.5. Look closely to see small black dots on the blades. Original Mach3 blades have a little larger dots and their paint does not feel as precise as the fake ones. This is because, real ones have an almost invisible clear coat but you can see it if you look at the black dots directly.6. Look at the blue plastic strip just under the blades, now try to abuse them with the tip of your fingernails (Be careful do not cut your fingers).They are many micro-aligned plastic lines, and When you do this, they re-align themselves immediately without no damage to themselves. BUT on fake ones, they try to align back, but they can\'t! They always leave marks on abused spots on them.7. Look at the front side of blades. Just under the moving head, you will see five parallel lines on the plastic stable part. On the real one the line in the middle is slightly thicker than other ones. But on the fake one they may show difference. And the fake ones, usually (not always) a little darker in color of plastic, if you have good eyes.8. Now a little flexibility test. You know Mach3s has flexible heads. Fake ones, too... However, if you move the head with your finger to the back, it should come back to the original place with a smooth movement. On the fake ones, they come back but they come back quicker than the real ones. And fake ones even make a slight plastic sound when coming back.9. Look at the plastic cartridge holder if it has serial number printed on it. If so, it still DOESN\'T mean they are real. Nowadays, they are putting serial numbers on fake ones, too. So, follow the first 8 steps, to make sure you have the real ones.Nowadays, fakes are so close to real, I hope this review helps to all of you. I know some of the sellers who sell fake ones will find this review not useful. BUT using genuine razors is a health issue so be careful. And always buy from reliable sellers. Amazon itself is very reliable but be careful with other third party sellers. Read their reviews first!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have to say though that I\'m quite impressed with how easy it was to use this Gillette Venus razor and how well it worked.There is no need for any shaving cream or gel at all - the moisturizing bars that encase the razor do an excellent job of providing the traction you need once they get wet, they leave a very slick almost gooey path along the surface of your skin as you go along.Overall I found this super-easy to use, I was able to shave my legs in much less time.  The only drawback I found was that I don\'t think I was able to shave quite as close as I normally am able to when using a plain razor and shaving cream.  I found after when running my hands across the surface of my legs when they were dry that they weren\'t quite as smooth, but it was still definitely a very good job and a great time-saver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I started out on the Gillette Mach 3, which went ok, and then saw a demo of the vibrating Fusion Proglide at a store. After trying it for the first time I was very impressed; having just tried the Mach 3, I can state for certain that the vibrating motion in the power Fusion Proglide helps avoid snagging and makes for a much smoother shave experience overall. The blades are pricey, but I doubt I\'ll mind too much given the results. Wow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

It works really well, especially if you don\'t want to be completely bare, but want a nice, neat look and feel. It also eliminates the fear of nicks and razor bumps. Like some of the other reviewers expressed, I also wish that Gillette sold replacement heads for the trimmer like regular razors. I purchased it in a set with a Venus razor, so I\'m happy that Amazon sells them like this. I will definitely buy this product again. I recommend storing this in a dry place because the blade can rust in places and become ineffective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

Went to a dermatologist, after she carefully read the ingredients used in Venus Spa Breeze, she was shocked. She said it\'s outrageous what they put in that product, she said the worst petrochemicals were used in that gel bar. Allergy now turned into infection, and my poor kid is using topical antibiotic with a possibility of starting an internal one if it doesn\'t get better. :((((( The terrible thing was that her best friend also reported similar symptoms and when I tried to shave a small area on my skin, it was inflamed and covered in blisters within 24 hours.

I decided to try it to thin out the foliage around the edge of the forest. Works great! Dramatically reduces the danger of nicking one of the boys, and doesn\'t trim so close that there\'s itchy irritation a day or two later. I can\'t believe it costs as much for three of them as it does for 14 of the regular Venus disposables (I\'d give 5 stars otherwise), but they\'re great nonetheless.

My wife has tried many different razors, many of them from the Venus line, and this one is about average.I\'ll try to just accentuate the nehative aspects she encountered, as most people seem to be more interested in that type of feedback. The three-blade design is a bit dated, and the razor itself it a bit bulky, making the whole thing a little awkward.  After 3 uses, the mousture gel bar fell off, rendering the razor\'s intended purpose useless.  Other than this, this razor does produce a smooth shave and minimizes razorburn.  Unfortunately, the blades do seem to get gunked up and don\'t rinse out easily.Overall, I give it an average review.

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

6343,2654,20110620,B004B8AZH0,4,"June 20, 2011",A329WJEOBESSZ,Great Shave...Just Expensive (But Less So on Amazon),"Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience. They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is space to hold 2 extra razor heads, and (this is true beauty to me!), the additional heads come sealed in their own protective plastic.

The replacement cartridges they are very very expensive. (of course Amazon has it on sale right now, but they are still too expensive).As far as the shaving experience goes, it is absolutely fabulous. It is extremely smooth and saves time while shaving. The lube strip seems to wear out faster than the Mach 3, but I could be mistaken there as I\'ve been using it for a a few days only now.Once a week I don\'t shave for a few days (weekends... one gets lazy) and the razor cuts through with ease, as if it were cutting through a days growth. Not only that, I used to have problems with hair getting stuck between the blades, whenever shaving after such an interval. with the Fusion it is not an issue. The hair washes off under the tap (means faucet for those who didn\'t understand \'tap\'), no struggling required.Expensive as it is (like other reviewers have observed as well), I\'m not going back to the Mach 3 that I used earlier. and certainly never to the Sensor excel I used before that.

Has sharpness of the Mach 3 with the trimmer of the Fusion,"The Fusion Proglide is Gillette\'s best razor since the Mach 3.I thought the Fusion was a big step back for Gillette.  They increased the number of blades, but used cheaper and duller blades, so the end result was a lot of grabbing and pulling on my skin, something I never experienced with the Mach 3.  The construction was also cheap, I had a Fusion break apart on me after a year.  I\'ve never had a Mach 3 break, over 10+ years of use.The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  But the trimmer would get clogged with hairs, which is annoying.The Fusion Proglide replaces the Fusion\'s dull blades with sharp blades that don\'t tug or pull on my skin, they just glide through and cut as they\'re supposed to.  Plus, this keeps the trimmer while improving it\'s design to allow hairs to wash away without clogging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	5	""July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was hesitant to buy the proglide since I knew it was just an \'improved\' version of the fusion. I figured this was just an attempt to sell us something all us fusion owners already had and my suspicion was furthered by other reviews posted here, which said the proglide was not much of an improvement over the fusion. But I decided to try it as I love new toys and though I really like the fusion I don\'t think it is perfect as occasionally it does give me razor burn. So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion. I don\'t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced. Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn\'t think it was perfect. But the proglide is so good I\'m not sure what the next step in shaving evolution will be as I feel this is as good as it gets. Definitely worth the $11 or so to switch from the fusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even after that I used the same blade for 2 weeks and it was the closest shave I have ever felt. There simply is no better razor than this one, it is a worthwhile investment because the razor will last a long time and provide an extremely close shave, if you get a razor pack with this it should last you months. I never use my electric shaver anymore, believe it or not it is faster to shave with this razor and cuts alot better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as \'Clean Shower\' or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.)Then I set the razor so it\'s standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I\'d also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I\'ve been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I\'ve nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I\'m very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.)Note to Gillette... Send me a lifetime supply of Fusion cartridges and I\'ll consider removing the blade-life extending tip from this review!  ;-)- Jonathan Sabin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only major problem is that they are a bit pricey.  While I do use the extra single blade, if that knocked the price down considerably I could do with the 5 on the other side.  The single side is great for edging your side burns and those tricky hairs in-between you eye brows (not a full on unibrow).The shave is close, comfortable and smooth.  I also wished they held up a little better for a little longer.  The shaves after the first few are great, but nothing like the first one with the clean fresh blades.If you have the money and are looking for a better shave, get this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I received the Gillette Fusion as a free promo and decided to try it. The initial sensation of having 5 blades scrape across my face was a bit unsettling (I imagined a layer of skin being shaved off) but the results were startling. Very close and comfortable shave -- only the beard was removed, not the skin. Single blade on the reverse side works fine for trimming sideburns and under the nose. I used the first blade for 22 shaves and did not nick myself once. I could only get 6-7 shaves out of a Sensor blade so, for me, the high price for Fusion blades is justified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I checked to make sure they worked with the regular Mach 3 razer, which I have (they do), and was thrilled to only be paying that price rather than regular store price of even the Mach 3 blades.Until I got them that is.  Right before they arrived, I NEEDED new blades, so I bought a pack at the store.  That pack was horrible...I felt like I didn\'t shave my legs at all.  I couldn\'t even really feel it against my skin as I was shaving like you normally do.  I literally had to go over each swipe like 3 times...and still wasn\'t a good smooth feel.When I got the blades from Amazon, the first pack I opened were the same thing.  I was ready to scream considering what you pay for the razors and the blades...a disposable would get you the same result.  I tried a blade from the second pack then, and that one worked MUCH better.I really think Mach is going downhill in their products, and it has become a \'you might get lucky and it works well\' with the razor blades.  Some are fine...some are horrible.if it is worth it to you to take a chance, then...you might get lucky.

After trying their Custom Plus3 and being extremely disappointed, I decided to give Sensor3 a try. They are exponentially better than Custom Plus3, but they still don\'t come close to the original Custom Plus as far as the quality of the lubrication strip and overall comfort are concerned. The razor tends to drag on your skin, leading to razor burn. Why Gillette can\'t use the same quality lubrication strip on Sensor3 as they do on the Custom Plus twin is beyond me. I would also prefer a non-pivot head to give me better control over the shaving angle, but that\'s more of a personal preference. It does not do all that great of a job on the chin and directly under the nose. The angle of the blades does not allow for good surface contact in these areas and can lead to nicks. Also, for my beard, each razor is single-use regardless of the brand, so I need to get the most bang for my buck. These come in a bit on the high-priced side, so that reflects negatively as well. I\'d give it 5 stars for the quality of the shave, subtract one star for the price factor (Amazon\'s price here is *ridiculous*! You can easily get these for 30-40% less in any store, but that is still expensive on a per-razor basis) and subtract one more star for the not-so-great lubrication strip (better than Custom Plus3, but still not as good as it could be). Overall, I will continue to use these, in conjunction with the original Gillette Custom Plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hadn\'t said anything so far, continuing to give them a chance, but today, I shaved and the blue bar that tells you to replace the razor is gone. One shave, and gone. Now, I know this isn\'t a magical indicator of some kind, but every other fusion blade I\'ve used from the store has had the blue bar on there for about as long as the razor quality lasts. It has been a reliable indicator in the past. One shave! I\'m very annoyed with these razors and finally had to say something.

Recently I started to experience irritation on my legs from it.  In effect, I was getting a razor burn type reaction.  I tried to salvage the situation by using shaving cream with it, but it was still giving me razor burn.  So I looked to try a new razor.  I ordered this one from Amazon and I\'m not sure I can ever go back to another razor.  It is super gentle and effective.  It gives a closer shave then I\'ve ever had before.  And no razor burn!  Definitely worth a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, I have been forced by them to move to Schick.  Not happy with being a virtual monopoly when it comes to men\'s shavers Gilette decides to over-engineer and to greedily get more profits by going so overboard that they have successfully made me give up on them after decades of being a loyal consumer.  As other reviewers have alluded to I actually got cut a couple of times which has never happened before!  I\'ve come to realise that the battery operated vibrator is a gimmick that does nothing at all to get a closer shave except to cause more batteries to be consumed and to fill up our landfills.  Thankfully, I\'ve been using rechargables for years and hence haven\'t had to buy batteries for years.  For people like me with sharper facial features, this 5-bladed \'wonder\' has such a large amount of rubber that it makes the overall blade area too high/thick (the breadth or height i.e. the vertical edge of the blade) to cover my chin area below my cheeks close enough without cutting my face.  Quite clearly the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns doesn\'t dawn on them when clearly there is a limit to the number of blades before you actually start spoiling the product!  For me it seems any \'improvement\' from going to 5 from 4 blades is so negligible to be non-existent in addition to giving me multiple cuts as the blades now do not contact my face as closely as before when I go from my cheek to my neck area.Unlike Schick where all their blades fit on all their holders greedy Gillette makes us \'upgrade\' to various blades by having to buy ever new blade holders.  Not content with profits from the blades alone, they have to insist on us buying the new holders to increase their revenues.Sick with the blatant exploitation of consumers, I have tried for the first time I can remember the Schick Quattro and I am happy now to get a close shave without cuts for a lower price knowing that any future blade enhancements will still fit my blade holder.Thanks Gillette for pushing me to your competitors; I didn\'t know what I was missing until now.Definitely NOT recommended!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have to admit, there I was standing in the shower looking at this thing and thinking \'I think I can pick up a squadron of German bombers coming in\'. Seriously, it looks like a WW2 coastal radar, not a razor. I mean it is big.. huge..ridiculous. I pictured the coroner finding my severed head in the shower, this thing clutched in my hands, \'air raid\' scrawled on the shower in blood. I have to admit- it is arguably the best shave I have ever had. I shave my head as well and I half expected it to look like a bowl of coleslaw when done but nary a nick at all. I found that due to it\'s size it did need fixing on a curve or two, but overall I was very impressed. I have been using Gillette disposable up till now. So it has impressed my skin, but now it has to make peace with my wallet. It all boils down to how long the blades last. I expect at least a week out of each. Usually those green \'lube\' strips are the first to go and after that the razors become pretty brutal. AT this price point I don\'t want to use more than one blade every week. If  they can manage that and send me some coupons then I am sold. But I think 5 blades is the stopping point- anything beyond that needs a pull starter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4004,1380,20090520,B001F51QJ8,5,"May 20, 2009",A24RT6AVJXJZHF,Wins me over from using a similar product by Unilever simply on design.,"I am thankful in the extreme that the manufacturers of antiperspirant have come up with OTC clinical strength for those of us who have lived their entire lives until now with embarassingly sweaty armpits.  I don\'t even stink of sweat, I just sweat out of my underarms alot.  Once a coworker even commented on it at my shirt and tie client facing job, recommending I change the brand of antiperspirant I use--but it wasn\'t like I didn\'t know I had this problem so it wasn\'t any more embarassing than the problem itself, now solved by great products like this one.  This not only helps me personally, but professionally as well.So I\'ve been using Degree prescription strength antiperspirant for about a year and a half now, and when the opportunity came up to try out a sample of this Gillette version I merely thought it would save me ten dollars.  Instead, I will be buying this from now on.What\'s the difference?  The active ingredient is the same and in the same amount--so one is just as effective as the other--and they both have moisturizers and such so that they don\'t irritate my underarms.  But the applicators are different in design and I have to say Gillette wins on this aspect alone.DESIGN / APPLICATOR: On the Degree product, the place on the applicator where the cream comes out is about the size of a quarter, whereas on the Gillette version it\'s wide enough to cover my entire underarm so I don\'t have to do circles with it to make sure I applied completely.  I believe this also causes me to use less of it, which makes it last longer and therefore is a better value.COMFORT: I noticed that with the Gillette product they seem to have put something in it that gives me a nice cooling sensation when I apply it.  It\'s very subtle, and very nice.  Degree, nor any other antiperspirant I\'ve ever tried, doesn\'t seem to have this.  I also feel the Gillette product is more comfortable.EFFECTIVENESS: As I wrote above, literally no difference in effectiveness between the Degree and Gillette products.  Same active ingredient, in the same amount.SCENT: The Gillette product that I sampled--the one on this page--has so little scent to it that we could say it practically has none.  It smells like and about as strong as Aveno moisturizer.  The Dove product, for comparison, smells really good, but not so strong that people notice it when you\'re near them.  I like the Gillette scent, or lack thereof, better.BOTTOM LINE: I didn\'t think this sample would cause me to change clinical strength antiperspirant from the brand I\'ve been using for years, but it did.  You should definitely try both and decide for yourself which one you prefer, but for me the clear winner is Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought these and they absolutely do not work as well as the real thing. The first thing I noticed was a broken seal on the package. The first cartridge broke in half when removing from the holder. The worst part is that the shaves are terrible. It feels like shaving with a tweezers. It is my opinion that anyone buying these will get ripped off. This is my first rip off when buying through Amazon so I will continue to use them.Note: I previously obtained Gillette Fusion Cartridges through Amazon from DAB and they were fine. These came from toponeenterprise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The works.I actually like the shave for my legs. My legs stay smooth 1-2 days longer than with my standard disposable razor. However, this razor really pulls at the underarms while shaving, and my underarms were quite senstive after shaving. Plus, this razor is pretty big (got to put 5 blades and a moisture ribbon somewhere), and that made it difficult to see while shaving my underarms.The storage pod for the shower? Clever idea, but try getting the thing open with wet hands. I\'ve found that it either pops open when I want it closed or won\'t open when I need it.Overall, this is a great razor for the legs. I like the smooth, close shave that it provides. However, after my underarm experience on 2 different occasions, I won\'t even attempt to use this for bikini areas (ouch). It\'s a bit too bulky for detail work, I think. That means I have to have 2 different razors, and that\'s a bit much. Considering that refill blades are about 20 bucks for this razor, I can\'t justify using it for the long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

Just finished shaving with it, I had to go over my entire face with a another razor that was getting on the dull side. Basically it caught hair more then it actually cut anything. The blades are placed so tight together and at such a acute angle that it never reaches the base of the follicle. This left me with a five\'o\'clock shadow in patches. I ran my fingers over the blades to see if they were dull, and surprisingly they slide right over them.Over all substandard quality. I\'ll be sticking with my plain old three blade Schick.

Through trial and error, plus reading advice online and in magazines, I\'ve come to the conclusion that two blades actually give a better shave than the blades with 3,4,or 5 blades (and probably by the time you read this they\'ll be up to 6, if they\'re not already).  It\'s all just marketing.  These blades do the job, and they don\'t tear up your skin as badly.  Plus, buying these blades on Amazon makes buying slightly more affordable. Because let\'s face it, Gillette is taking us for a ride with their mach line of blades, paying Derek Jeter and friends millions to convince us more blades is better.

While yes the product does cause less tug and pull, the razor does not give you the same close long lasting shave as the previous generation Mach 5 turbo. This causes you to shave more often and go through blades faster, therefore spending more money.  I have a decent supply now, but I will return to the Turbo\'s when theses are used up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

5660,1962,20100902,B003983HZK,5,"September 2, 2010",A1VBHX96TQPUXK,Really surprised,"So for about the past 20 years I\'ve been using an electric razor, different brands but lately its been a braun.  When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her exact words were that \'it felt like I was dragging a football field full of blades across my legs.\'  The \'moisturizer strips\' didn\'t do anything that she could detect.  She used her three blade razor on one leg and this on the other, and, on a blind test, I determined that the leg shaved with the three blade razor felt smoother.  And the Venus Embrace left her other leg looking red and irritated -- it felt a little roughed up.  My wife pointed out that the huge \'moisturizer\' surrounding the blades makes it impossible to do any fine trimming.  Also, she didn\'t like the shower mount or the amount of packaging on the \'shower safe\' replacement blade.  It seems wasteful.  And who changes the blade in the shower instead before starting the water?  Sometimes less is more, and fewer than five blades certainly seem do to a better job for shaving.  I imagine the replacement blades are quite expensive.  But that\'s Gillette\'s business model: hook them with a razor and then clean up on the blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

When I\'m at home, I like to shave with something that feels like it\'s built to last. After all, you don\'t drive a Power Wheels toy to work. HOWEVER, sometimes the need arises for a disposable razor...and when that time comes, consider reaching for a Gillette Good News razor.Aesthetics: 3 stars. There certainly isn\'t anything to look at on this razor. Lately, many of the big names (Fusion, Quattro) have been marketed in special colors and designs. This is plain razor with a plastic blue handle. The end. Yet, in its understated styling, it still has good features for a cheap disposable: pivoting head (non-pivot style available), lubrastrip, good blade angle.The shave: 4 stars. Yep, this thing ranks right up there with the big boys. It is a close and very comfortable shave. If you\'ve got sensitive skin (like me), the Good News performs quite nicely. It\'s a close shave without ripping a layer of skin off. Cuts are highly unlikely (unless the blade is dull, of course). The lubrastrip provides a small level of glide, but a good shaving cream/gel is recommended with this razor.Durability: 3 stars. I\'ve had disposables that lasted just one shave, others that last a week or more. This one is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack with regard to durability. I typically get three shaves out of a Good News razor.Conclusion: Good shave, ideal for people with sensitive skin. They don\'t last long, but the upside is that they are among the lowest-priced disposables on the market. Recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At first i was thinking who really needs 5 blades? I thought that was overkill but i gave it a try when i ran out of blades for my mach 3. The shave was very close with much less irritation and i wasn\'t even using my favorite shaving cream (Kiss my Face), i was VERY impressed to say the least. I hate to shave at the best of times but the Fusion makes it very easy to get a close shave and i no longer have to go against the grain to get down to bare skin which is a necessity for those \'intimate\' moments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For me it has changed the way I feel about shaving tenfold. The fusion was good but I still had issues with razor burn. The proglide changed all that. Usually I go about a day in between shaving. After buying the Proglide on Saturday and shaving that evening, I didn\'t shave till Tuesday night & that\'s cause I wanted to. I could have went a couple more days but I like a smooth head so I shaved. I couldn\'t believe how close a shave I got with this blade and went for days without any razor burn or irritation at all and that\'s going with the grain. I always liked going against the grain cause it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was, my head couldn\'t take the pain afterwards so I stuck with going with the grain. With the Proglide I\'m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road I\'ll give it a shot because just going with the grain I get a damn close shave. I know it won\'t be the case for some other people but for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years. Highly, HIGHLY recommend buying this prduct.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The slippery surface increases the razor\'s performance, however the lubrication expires quickly, resulting in a dry surface that makes shaving uncomfortable. I think it is foolish for expiring lubricating strips to be the reason behind frequent blade changes. I order my razors from preciseshave.com.

426,436,20081014,B000277P5E,5,"October 14, 2008",A1V0VROLPWXFG7,First time user of Mach 3 Turbo system,"I\'ve been using various foam depillatories, electric, and manual systems for approx. 30 years. The last 10 years I had used the Bump Fighter disposables and lately the Bic 2 blade disposables. They were OK, but you have to really look closely at your face in good light to see that spots were missed, especially the chin. They don\'t flex and adjust to the surface of your face. If you\'re careful and take your time, you can get a pretty close shave with them, but when you are rushing in the morning to get your family out the door - on time for school and work - quick is the word.I opened a free sample that Gillette had sent me some 3 years ago, tried it, and fell in love. It was the best shave - no irritation - even against the grain, which I never did with the other systems for fear of razor bumps. I was truly impressed!Now I\'m looking for a good bargain on refills. After reading some of these critical but helpful reviews, I will definitely buy from a store. I really like them even if they are pricey. Going to have to work this cost thing out. I was nick free the first couple of times I used the Mach 3 -  and that hasn\'t happened in a long while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also found the gel bar to be a bit messy if left on counter top, though this razor comes with a shower hook to let us avoid this problem.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

It was a good razor but I wanted something better to try. I saw the commericals for the proglide and thought to give it a chance. The proglide is one of the best razors I have ever used. It does not cut and tug on hairs and the blades are so smoooth, despite the old fusion blades being terrible. I love this shave and recommend anyone with sensitive skin to buy this product. The only con I have about this razor is the price of blades. The economy is down and razor blade prices are increasing. WTF?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not to put too fine a point on it but if a razor doesn\'t julienne my skin during the process of removing hair, I\'m satisfied.I was was somewhat stupefied when I opened the package and discovered that the handle had no loaded cartridge--the analogy that occurred to me was Carolyn Jones as Morticia Addams snipping off the heads of flowers. This, if it wasn\'t an oversight, struck me as kind of cheesy. I used the razor on my legs and underarms, without lather, and it did a good job and allowed me to retain my epidermis. I really don\'t know how long the lubricating action will last but I\'m sure it will continue to perform just as well with lather (I should add that my body hair is sparse and fine and doesn\'t dull a blade very fast).Speaking of cheesy, the oh-so-classy, \'sure you can spare it?\' holder-on-a-suction cup that\'s useless on a bathroom wall with very small tiles would have better been left on the drawing board. Other than that, the Gillette Venus Proskin Moisturerich (a lot of syllables for such a small item) performs as advertised, at least on my kind of hair. One then has to determine if the cost of refills vs. buying disposable razors is worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this razor is absolutely wonderful.  I shaved my entire body except for my head and torso and it gave a close shave.  First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  However, once you power it on, the vibration allows it to glide smoothly over your body.  When I shave with my normal razors I always get pin hole knicks all over my body (about 8-15) and come out of the shower bleeding. With this razor, I only had one knick--simply amazing. Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.I also had my boyfriend try it and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily but he could get use to that. He also said it shaves as close as his ordinary razor. He gave the razor 4 stars instead of my 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can\'t guarantee this will work for everyone but for me it\'s an excellent product.

I have used high end brands like Clinique. I used an organic brand, the name of which I do not remember because it was a long time ago, that gave me a rash. I have even used a lower priced brand like Barbasol. In the end I can say that every one allowed me to shave well. The Hydra Gel that I am currently use really allows the blades of my Fusion razor to smoothly glide over my face. Another plus is that I only use a drop. I drop the size of a dime is plenty to generate a nice lather on one side of my face. So, basically, 3 dime size gel drop will get the whole face covered in a great lather. One can should last me a couple of months I assume. If I use too much my face tends to be left with kind of a film on it from the gel. It comes off easily but you really need to wash your face thoroughly.Less is better.My face has a close shave, no rashes, no bumps.

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

4206,1587,20100328,B001JQLNFA,1,"March 28, 2010",A3O3BQCBCA1VCT,"Slime and burn, slime and burn","Okay, so I received a free sample of this razor (it came in a clear travel bag, with a free bottle of shower gel and a free bar of deodorant. I needed the travel bag, and it was only (...) for the bag and all the free stuff, so it was a no-brainer).What I like about this razor:1. It\'s pink.2. It\'s thin, girly and cute.3. It\'s comfortable to hold.4. It has the built-in shaving gel.Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 of those are all really superficial and don\'t amount to much.What I don\'t like about this razor:1. The very first thing I noticed about it is that there is a slimy, goopy gook that stretches (picture okra or chicken slime when you\'re cleaning it) as you shave. It is absolutely, positively gross and unsightly. Perhaps I\'m making too big a deal of that, but I have a weak stomach, and that really grossed me out.2. I wet my legs, turned the shower off, and sat down inside.  After I shaved my right leg, I immediately began shaving my left leg (I had some Nair on my bikini area, so I didn\'t have time to waste). While I was shaving my left leg, my right leg began to sting. After about two minutes, it became unbearable, so even though the time wasn\'t up on my Nair and I hadn\'t quite finished my left leg, I had to get under some running water.  THAT MADE IT WORSE!!! Both my legs began to burn! Discomfort is an understatement. I was in pain! I don\'t normally have sensitive skin, and this was the first time I\'ve ever had a shaving product to make me feel that way. It was absolutely unbearable.So bad that I actually had to write a review. I think in my entire life, I may have been compelled to write a review once or twice. That\'s how bad this experience was. So it\'s been about 15 minutes since I got out the shower. My legs aren\'t burning anymore, and they feel somewhat smooth. Not as smooth as my regular razor (Schick Intuition - which is nice and gives great results, but so bulky and big), but it\'ll do. I don\'t think the blades on this Spa Breeze got as close as I would like.All in all, I would never buy this razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it\'s hard to continue shaving when there\'s hair worsening the blades\' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick. Whatever the case, I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

496,506,20110520,B000BUUVTE,5,"May 20, 2011",AIIMZDRJ8LM9I,The Gillette Fusion Razor Has Done this Soldier Well for More than Five Years....,"My wife gave me a Gillette Fusion razor blade prior to my train-up for a deployment to Afghanistan in late 2006. During that deployment, I managed to use the same blade for 20+ days at a time. Did I mention I also shaved my scalp with the same blade....? Since my return home at the end of 2007, I\'ve been getting a month\'s use per blade on both my face and scalp. I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but, what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long? On the 1st of each month, I replace the old blade with a fresh one. The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months.... You have to admit, that\'s money well spent.I\'ve used all types of blades starting when I was 15...single, double, triple edge blades...Electric shavers, clippers, and even depilatories(which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it, spread it on, wait for it to cure, scrape it off, and wash the excess off my face). I\'ve never had a razor blade that shaved me so close, for so long.To close this review I\'d like to add that I\'ve been on Active Duty in the U.S. Army for 24 years, 7 months & 21 days now and will retire in 41 days (June 30th).  I will continue to shave my face and scalp with the Gillette Fusion but, I doubt I\'ll do it as often. I\'ve earned it.

The blades felt like they were scraping too closely against my skin and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience, without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.A year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!) instead of buying a new razor altogether. The experience was completely different from what I remembered! The razor just glided over my skin, I never felt like I had to go back over areas, it was incredibly comfortable, and, most importantly, an extremely close shave!Surprised, I wondered what it could be, and realized that it might be the blades making the difference. I picked up some Fusion Power replacements and tried them side by side and it confirmed for me - the Fusion Power blades are markedly worse than the regular Fusion blades.Don\'t believe me? Give it a shot yourself, I think you\'ll find that the best combo is to buy a Fusion Power razor and regular Fusion blades.Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The blades are now up to a perhaps ridiculous row of five - I didn\'t notice that they shave any closer.  As a matter of fact, they seemed to do a slightly worse job than my 3-blade Venus.The biggest change - and the reason I won\'t be changing to this version - is the moisturizing pad around the blades.

Oddly enough others asked what I was wearing and told me it was very pleasant.Applying this deodorant was fairly easy. With other stick deodorants it feels like you\'re rubbing a rock under your arm, uncomfortable. This was unlike others and applied smoothly.The big minus:Kind of uncomfortable. While application is pretty smooth actually wearing it is not. After wearing it for a couple of hours it begins to, for lack of a better word, chafe. The downfall of stick deodorant begins to shine through. As the moisture of the deodorant begins to disappear you are left with a powdery irritating feeling.The Rundown:I work in an office and don\'t really find myself in the situations where I\'m sweating profusely. Because of this the anti-perspiration factor is, to me, not needed. A product that is strictly deodorant tends to work best.I\'ll be sticking to my Old Spice Red Zone. However, if your job requires you to work in high heat, or you work out often this deodorant will work best in those conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does NOT navigate curvy legs very well. I had more than one significant cut the first time I used it.  I felt like the head pivoted a little TOO much which made it hard to keep the blades in contact with my skin.  The gels strips do not lather, but do have a very strong, but not unpleasant fragrance.  However, if you are sensitive to perfume, this is not your razor.Because the head is so bulky, the shave actually took longer than with a straight razor. The bulbous looking things on either side of the blade created drag on curved areas, such as underarms and ankles and didn\'t glide over those areas successfully.  I had to go over them several times to remove all unwanted hair.I would say this is BETTER than the Soliel razor that I bought for less money (smoother shave) but not as good as the Venus Embrace which gave me a smoother shave with a little less effort and no heavy perfume.My overall complaint with ALL of the Gillette Venus line is that the razors are very bulky. They do provide a good shave, but you have to cover the same areas more than once because the shave head is so large.  For my sensitive skin, that means more razor irritation.  I would recommend this one over several other out there, but if you want the best shave for the same price, go with the Embrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

This stick provided all of the wetness protection I needed without stinking me up like \'sport scent\' or \'fresh powder\' or whatever other synthetic smells these things contain.The real question: does it work?  To this I answer a resounding YES.To demonstrate, I took this with me to Bali in lieu of a normal travel sized deodorant.  I wanted to stay dry without smelling something that might attract extra blood suckers.  Bali is hot, humid, and very prone to making people sweaty.  Did this stick solve all of my sweat problems?  Absolutely not.  Did it mitigate some of the unsightly wet spots that come with being human?  Absolutely.My only complaint, and this is about all aluminum oxide antiperspirants, is that the chemicals stain the pits of white shirts yellow.  Not cool, but I\'ve yet to find a way around it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shave is super smooth and 100 times better than my previous razor. The chin area used to be hassle for me while shaving, but with the proglide it was a breeze.

1748,649,20091118,B000BUUVTY,1,"November 18, 2009",A1JU7JR6O3Y3OD,Nice PR above my Review Dont buy these blades,These do have serial numbers yet shave nothing like the same ones I buy at local retailers where I live. Just got off the phone with Amazon no problem getting refund and getting free shipping label to send back. Yet will never buy razor blades from any store online again. Dont have the time to do the research if they are knock offs or no I just know from my experience with the ones from Amazon that they are way to sharp and cut up my neck and face even though I first wet my face with hot water then wait a couple minutes for shaving cream to settle into skin and shave the exact way I always do which never caused cuts with the blades I buy locally. Who knows whats up I will stick to buying my razor blades from the local retailers.Update: I contacted Amazon about this product. I hate to do this but because these are fakes I told them they will be shipped to Proctor and Gamble\'s counterfeit department for inspection. The reason I am doing this is because first of all the fake blades I received give a painful shave and I just cant allow fellow buyers to be deceived the way I was. So hopefully Amazon will either sell real ones or Procter and Gamble will peruse legal action. The bottom line is buyers like myself would gladly pay the couple extra dollars you would at Wal Mart rather then be deceived and being sold fake blades. And yes Amazon did refund my money but the procedure when you receive a counterfeit product is not to return it to the merchant first you should contact the company who makes the actual product then local and state attorney departments and the better business beuero. If I wanted fake razor blades I would have purchased them off of Ebay. Grow up Amazon and quit trying to trick people!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4034,1410,20090407,B001F51QJ8,2,"April 7, 2009",AXU3VKZE848IY,"It\'s not bad, simply not that much better than others","Gillette clinical strength.I have used this product for over a week now. My reference product was Mennen Speed Stick Antiperspirant Icy Blast. In my reviews I always try do some concrete data gathering, so for this test I compared performance under extra warm conditions and extra stress conditions. The extra clothing or heat induced perspiration was controlled 100% effectively by both products. Under stress situation (such as an important presentation), the Gillette Clinical Strength (GCS) did perform marginally better. I would estimate that a 2 by 2 inch \'wet spot\' with Mennen Speed Stick (MSS) was reduced to about a 1.5 by 1.5 inch spot with GCS, for a 40% better wetness control. Sorry for the graphical details.So I perspire more under stress than under heat. The instructions for GCS are elaborate, three clicks of the screw applied the night before, metered through a bunch of small holes (typical of gel antiperspirants). The fragrance is subtle and baby powder like. Interestingly enough on the ingredients list its referred to as a \'masking fragrance\'.Now for the analysis. The active ingredient in both products is Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex in MSS (or trichlorohydrex in GCS). They are both in the same antiperspirant family as far as any wikipedia or dermatology website explain. The MSS contains 15% active ingredient, while the GCS contains 20% active ingredient. So in summary one additional swipe with the non clinical product gives you as much protection as a \'clinical strength\' product. The clinical product contains 1.7 oz vs 2.7 oz (40% less) for regular and costs over twice as much. For basically same product??? So do the math, and apply one more swipe of your regular product. You will get the same protection at lower cost. Its not that the Gillette Clinical Strength is bad, but it pricing takes advantage of peoples self consciousness about sweating. It should only be 33% more expensive based on the concentration for equivalent weight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From Axe to Old Spice to Ban to Secret... you name it, chances are I\'ve tried it.  A little about me:  big guy -- 6\'1\', normal-hairy, and definitely sweats.I generally like the Gillette products.  In this case, though, I really wasn\'t a big fan.  Simply, I didn\'t find the product all that effective --  I would sweat right through it, where I wouldn\'t with other similar products.  I also found the smell a little too strong at times.  I like the anti- perspirants / deodorant combo, but in this case I found the anti- perspirants a little less effective than I needed, and the deodorant a little more than I wanted.I also found that this product leaves a weird film, which doesn\'t easily wash off.  I regularly find in the shower that it\'s still slick / hair matted from where I applied the product previously.  Not particularly cool.  Many (but not all) other products like this don\'t leave this sort of residue, or at least not as much as this one does.  My 2-cents at least.One nice thing about this product I definitely noticed -- they give you a fair sized stick of it.  I hate spending $3-4 on a stick of this stuff and running out shortly after.  In this case, I think the product would last a little longer than average.  Nice work Gillette.In the end, I don\'t think I will be purchasing this product again.  I just don\'t think it\'s as good as some of the others on the market, at least for me.  It doesn\'t protect as much as I\'d like it to, leaves a film I don\'t like, and can sometimes be too odorous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You could say it is a hybrid trac II.In my opinion, putting more blades on is a scam for you to buy more blades at a higher cost, keep in mind these are aluminium sharpened fine and coated for comfort, wrapped in plastic to attach at the head.Multi blades are going to last longer, common sense should tell you though, to put another 1-2-3 more blades in a razor shouldn\'t drive the cost up another $20.00 to $30.00.So as not to get off track, this razor system is great, the regular blades provide a close shave, the handle is at such an angle you can see those hard to get to places such as nose, sides, jawline.The sensor blades which are a little better, can provide a comfortable shave for people with more sensative skin, I find using barbasol with aloe or something comparable will give a close shave yet not have that burn afterward.My shave routine consists of:1.  cold water splash on the face, this tightens the pours of the skin and makes the whiskers stand up a little better.2.  I use barbasol regular, it\'s cheap, it\'s foam, and it does the job.3.  where you start is up to you, I usually start right to left going with the flow of the whiskers.  Never go against the grain as this will give you bumps (pseudofoliculitis barbae)and that can be a little uncomfortable or not look so good on that hot date or job interview.4.  after I shave i jump in the shower, however, if you don\'t always rinse.  This gets the cream off and any sediment such as left over whiskers and keeps them from entering skin pours and causing irritation, a big pimple or a serious infection.5.  Now, this is optional and I would recommend this for guys starting to shave.  Try some after shave lotion, it soothes the skin so you don\'t have that burn feeling all day, it also tightens the pours so you have a smooth shave longer and the girls appreciate a man that smells good and has a smooth face.i hope this helps some of you, pick what works for you.By the way gillette, I bet you are losing money on your blades, try lowering the prices for the everyday guy to afford to shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

	3	""January 25, 2010",ALEXOU3LVUYS9,Not really all that great,I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor?

I use these razors to trim and line up my beard, and to shave my head, and each razor lasted for a month. I think that\'s astonishing, considering that I use this razor to shave my WHOLE head every, or every other day, and basically shave my neck and line up my beard every other day with it too. That\'s a pretty amazing deal if you think about it. All you\'ve got to do, is use a good shaving cream, with a rich lather, and it\'ll work great, for a close shave that lasts a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have owned the original Venus razor (the light tealish one) for close to 15 years now, and I finally said to myself, I want a new razor. My old was still in working order, but just extremely faded. I am sure this one will last me another 15 years, and of course works just as well as my old one. I would recommend this product to anyone. Actually, as a mother\'s day gift, I finally got my mother, who would only use disposables for 30 years, to finally switch to a Venus, and she is in love!!

I personally tend to veer away from the products with arctic or sea in the title, and did find the scent to be a little overwhelming to my rather sensitive sniffer.

The razor is good, but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly, I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance, nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn\'t causes itching, so that the good part about the blades. However, after a month of use, for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall, decent purchase, nothing extraordinary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1692,593,20080111,B000BUUVTY,2,"January 11, 2008",A1VSAH8A7DDVER,The Ugly Truth Gillette Doesn\'t Want You to Know,"If you read the description closely of the Gillette Fusion product as put out by Gillette, you will see that Gillette doesn\'t actually claim that you get a closer or even better shave. They very cleverly use terms like \'a better way to shave\' or \'30% closer blades\', and there is a reason for this. The reality is that very little (if any) improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems. And Gillette knows this through their own internal research. Their studies show that customers can\'t discern the difference between 3-blade and Fusion systems. It is all just perception. However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems. The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.Here is another interesting tidbit you probably didn\'t know about all of this. Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements. Well there is a reason for this too. The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer. Gillette doesn\'t want folks to get a bad first impression. As you probably know, they don\'t make money on the razors. The real money is with the replacement blades. And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.With the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Embrace is the first time I feel like they\'ve improved on the original design.  The Breeze has a similar moisture ribbon, but it always melts off before the blades are worn out, and the heads are just too expensive for that to be tolerable.The moisture ribbon on the Embrace is pretty solid to the touch so you really don\'t get any more than you need and it doesn\'t melt prematurely.  There\'s no residue on my legs when I\'m done shaving, just smooth skin.  The best part is I can have both legs shaved from ankle to hip in one third of the time it used to take me to shave with other razors because I don\'t need to use shave gel, and the handle and the shape of the head make it really hard to cut myself, so I can just go zip-zop.The only issue I\'ve had is that it\'s slightly tricky to shave armpits with the Embrace because the head is so big, and it\'s a bit difficult to maneuver in intimate areas.  It\'s no less effective than other razors, it just takes some adaptation and adds a little time.  That said, all in all, my total shave time -- legs, armpits, intimate region -- is half of what it used to be, and that\'s more than worth the price of the Embrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gillette keeps inrocuding newer, more expensive razors.  The latest, Proglide Fusion has been so heavily disocunted that I deided to give it a try.  It is a perfectly fine razor once you get used to maneuvering the rather large head in tight spaces, like around your nose.For the first couple days, I shaved half my face with the old and the other half with the new and really couldn\'t see/feel much of a difference.  I continued to use the new one for about 3 weeks and then went back to the SENSOR.  It shaves every bit a well as the newer one and for about one third the cost for the new blades.  I rue the day when they stop making these blades.  This seems to be in the planning stages as they are now encouraging people to not buy MACH3 and switch to Proglide.

Ladies, you know how it is, after a couple of decades, shaving your legs becomes a chore to dread. The Venus Embrace has eased that chore for me. I\'ve used Venus products for several years, but this one is miles ahead of past versions, and it does everything it claims to do.Yes, it is comfortable to hold--rather like those pens with the soft rubbery stuff on the outside. I think it makes the razor less slippery in your hand as well. That\'s important in the shower especially. The holder is oddly shaped, but there are no hinges to open or to break. Time will tell if that open design is a good thing or not. It did fit well and unobtrusively in my cramped shower. I loved the suction cups though as opposed to the old sticky stuff.The most important thing, however, is the actual results from using the Venus Embrace. Here, it really shined. Smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I deliberately made only one pass to see how well the product worked. Perfect! One pass was all that was needed; my legs were smooth, hair-free, and without a single nick or scrape. There was a slight scrape on my underarm, but that could have been user error. How long that moisture strip lasts has to be determined over time, but so far, I love this razor. It\'s my new product of choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each new iteration of this series promises an even closer shave than the previous one.  I now own two MACH3 Turbo razors (given as gifts), but am less than satisfied with the product.When the blades are new, the shave is great, but they don\'t last that long.  Don\'t even think about buying blades and storing them -- at least they don\'t work that well in the tropics.  I\'ve found the conditioning strips began melting on my unused blades and sometimes even causing rust on the blade.  My experience with this razor is bittersweet, it is probably the best razor on the market but cost of blades will do you in quickly.I can\'t wait for the next iteration of this series, although by then I might move on to an electric shaver.  Basically don\'t believe the advertising -- a shave that close will probably only happen once with a fresh blade, and if you have thick hair it may also give you a little nick to get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cartridges are expensive, so I\'ve alternated between the Fusion and a Merkur safety razor with Feather blades.  When I want a really close shave and don\'t have a lot of time to spend shaving, I opt for the Fusion.  It requires less preparation time for my beard and I don\'t have to be nearly as careful while shaving.  Also, typically one pass does the job with the Fusion.As for the new model, the Proglide, there are improvements.  They\'ve created better spacing between the blades to help keep the razor from clogging.  I think this also improves drying, which should lengthen the life of the blades.  I don\'t care how much, or what kind of coating they put on the blades, they will eventually rust.  It seems also that the trim blade is improved.  It\'s very handy for getting the tight spots, like right under your nose.  That\'s a problem area with a safety razor and certainly with a Mach 3.  All in all, this is a great razor and one that I would use every day if the replacement blades weren\'t so expensive.  I\'ll keep this puppy in the rotation, especially for travel and those times when I don\'t have much time on my hands.Recommended, but only 4 stars because of the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

The slim head is much more manageable than the oversized wall of blades of the Mach 3 (which feels like you are just wiping your face with blades, instead of using a razor).

Then I tried the Venus Embrace Razor.  I will never go back to my original razor choice again.First thing I noticed was how the Venus 5-blade razor with its ribbon of moisture \'zipped\' across my skin and removed all the hair smoothly, easily, quickly, and completely on the first stroke every time.  I had not even realized the \'drag\' I was experiencing with my original razor choice until I felt how smoothly the Venus razor did its work. I had just shaved my legs the previous day, but my razor had \'given out\' just before completing my shave and one leg had not gotten a smooth shave.  Trying Venus Embrace the next day, not only did I get an immediate and smooth shave on the \'unfinished\' leg, but on reshaving the \'completely shaved\' leg, I found that that I actually had not gotten a really thorough shave on it the day before either.I have always resisted those shaped, fat-handled razors because they look bulky.  My regular razor was thin and straight-handeled.  Now I see what all the hype is about.  The handle is comfortable, fits perfectly into the hand, is soft to the touch, and is wonderfully positioned.  It just feels \'good\' in my hand.  Actually it feels \'great\'.No \'suctioned-cupped\' item has ever seemed to work for me.  If they stuck at all, they were generally on the floor the next day.  Therefore I originally didn\'t intend to even try the showerpod.  After reconsidering how helpful it would be to have all my shaving utensils available inside the tub/shower area, I positioned it where I thought it would be handy if it would stick and affixed the suction cups.  Voila, it not only stuck, it is still there weeks later, never having come \'unstuck\' even once.While I regret my stubborness to give the newer-styled ladies razors a chance; I am completely sold on this Venus Embrance razor and anticipate it will be a long time before I think about changing razor brands again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, I am not a complainer or nutcase - I am a 58 year old businessman who needed a new razor and had a coupon. I bought the 5-blade Fusion vibrating razor for that reason only - I had a coupon.As Gillette has apparently figured out, 5 blades is a dumb idea because it is so wide you can\'t negotiate those tight places around the nose, etc. To account for this - rather than addressing the actual problem they added a single \'trimmer\' blade to the opposite side. Brilliant!Well, I can not remember the last time I actually CUT myself with a razor until this razor came along.  Twice in transitioning from my neck to chin I have managed to drag the trimmer blade across my chin laying it open the entire width of the blade!  Not a nick, mind you, but a freakin\' wound!  Sure, I could continue to use it and just \'be more careful\' but that would be wrong. There are too many better products on the market for me to make allowances for crappy and dangerous design.Two major cuts in the same spot and I now have an actual scar.  Just thought you\'d want to know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shave was definitely a more pleasant experience in that the power handle caused less pulling frequent with the mach 3.That being said, I have a difficult chin where the grain will vary from place to place. I have to be just as thorough with this handle and I find that a shave takes just as long for maybe a slightly improved result.Finally, there is an extra blade on the top of the unit for precision trimming.

It actually shaves pretty well, though I must confess, I do use the gel and after shave. However I only shaved with the grain, because going against it, would usually leave me razor burn. Especially when I\'d forget to shave a day or 4. Also going with the grain you wouldn\'t get as smooth a feel as you would going against. Then, out of pure curiousity, I used, according to what the reviewers before me said, the seldom used single blade on the back, to go against the grain. Wahla! It gave me the smooth shave I wanted, and even when I\'d forgoe shaving for a couple days, I have yet to receive any razor burn. Give it a try, and that 2 star shave becomes a 4. By the way, I gave it a 4, becuase it just so damn expensive, buying the new cartridges, and shave gel. Yet here I am going to the store anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5805,2109,20100601,B003987CL0,4,"June 1, 2010",A2SD1Z4OROY538,"A great shave, but not significantly better than my old Fusion","The big difference with this product is that it\'s powered so my review will focus there.  One AAA battery (included) goes into the handle.  Just press the blue button and you get a vibrating disposable razor.  Very cool, but it doesn\'t seem to make a difference.  For one, the marketing materials included in the package make no claim to any incremental benefit of using the vibrating razor function, only that it turns itself off after 7 minutes.  There are plenty of claims about the thinness of the blades, etc. but nothing about the power function.  In fact, it\'s distracting, and in some cases for me, interferes with the tactile nature of shaving.  Sometimes you need that feel when you\'re hunting for a few whiskers that escaped the first one or two passes.  You don\'t want to redo an area too many times, so you sense by feel where the patch is that needs extra attention.  This razor made me realize how tactile in nature blade shaving can be.As for the rest of the features, I\'m sure Gillette made some incremental improvements but I can\'t tell.  I do think the first shave out of the package was just marvelous.  If I were rich and spendthrift I would only use each blade once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I absolutely think that they are the best razors. You buy a handle that comes with razor cartridges and a holder for the shower and then just buy additional razor cartridges as needed. One cartridge will last me for months, much different and eventually much cheaper than the cheapest disposable razors which only last about a week or so.Gillette\'s new Venus Spa Breeze Razor combines the great Venus razor blades and handle with new shave gel bars that eliminate the need for separate shaving cream.I wasn\'t sure at first about how well the shave gel bars would work but after trying, I\'m hooked. This changes shaving for me from now on. It\'s aggravating to have to use shaving cream and with the Venus Spa Breeze, you don\'t need it.Perfect for shaving in the shower, just wet the razor and glide the razor over your legs. A smooth shave with no irritation. Afterwards, my legs were incredibly smooth and soft. Just be careful over smaller areas like underarms to be sure you have plenty of water to avoid irritation. It seemed the longer that I used the razor like over the long stretches of leg, the shave gel bars seem to really work the best. The razor doesn\'t produce foam or cream like actual shaving cream but just a slick moisturizer, that\'s why it works best with plenty of water.*Note* If you are currently a regular Venus razor user, the cartridges for the Venus Spa Breeze fit the blue Venus handle also so you could just purchase the Spa Breeze cartridges to use with your current handle.Highly recommend. Venus Spa Breeze razors are all I\'m buying from now on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I purchased a Gillette Fusion razor with a $4 off coupon out of the Sunday news, and that gave me the razor for about $1 after the in-store rebate.This is easily the best razor I have ever owned/used.  One pull of the razor across my face makes the skin unbelievably smooth.  I won\'t be switching to anything else after buying this product.TIPS:Don\'t throw the cartridges out after the aloe \'indicator\' strip fades - that thing is useless junk added on to make you replace the blades more often than is necessary.  Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies.  The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing.  They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry.  I can get more than a month of shaves out of a single cartridge before the blades dull and start to nick or pull at the skin.  Buying a 12-pack of blades lasts me longer than a year . . .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s a cross between the old stick razors and an electric -- and I can use it while I take a shower. I get the closest, most comfortable and nick-free shaves from this little guy. Even when I occasionally take a week off from shaving (vacations, etc.), I fire this puppy up, take my time, and soon have a great close shave just as if I\'d been doing it all along -- without the whisker tugging, bloody cuts, and uneven finish like the old days. Yes, the blades are expensive, but they last me a long time. I also like that I hardly ever have to replace the battery, and I like the little backside trimmer for my ever-growing nose and ear hair. Great product!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

4261,1643,20090423,B001JQLNFA,5,"April 23, 2009",A4UFU4WKYEUGO,A Lady\'s Razor,"Nicely packaged. The blades are in little plastic capsules that sit inside a plastic housing with a lid. This is a big switch from most ladies razors I have tried. Because the blades are sealed, they don\'t loose their moisturizing gel every time you turn on the shower. The casing comes with a little mounting bracket that is not hard to place or figure out. I have really bad eyesight, so fishing around for a razor without my glasses on can be entertaining.The razor and stem are ridiculously feminine. It really does go right past any attempt at simple functionality and well into something a 14 year old girl would throw a tantrum for. It\'s marvelous. The stem is a very elegant swirly pearl color with all these interesting rubber bits that make it easy to hold. It is easy to hold. I think you\'d really have to make an effort to drop it regardless of how soaped up you get. But you won\'t drop it because you will not want to.The blades are surrounded by these wide pink lip like things that look, to be quite honest, like something you\'d find in a adult movie used by the goddess of immaculate hairlessness. They are squishy and smell wonderful. They also work quite well if you get them damp so you can have a safe dry shave, or touch up.The Venus Breeze razor is really over the top but does function quite well. I tried it out on three day old leg stubble and was left with baby soft skin. I like it. It\'s a private, sweet smelling indulgence that works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

It\'s not. Old Spice is an antiquated technology and it amazes me how they are still even in business when there is something so amazing as Gillette Clear Gel out on the market. You put it on and it stays on, it\'s completely invisible. With other deodorants you will begin to smell your body odor permeate through the inferior deodorant after a few hours. With Gillette Clear Gel, there is no body odor, ever. If I wanted to, I could go days without showering and it would keep working strong the whole time. The scents themselves smell fantastic, it doesn\'t smell like gag inducing cologne like Axe deodorant, it smells fresh. After a few hours the smell dies, but the protection is still there.

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

2072,981,20080331,B000XVSNTQ,5,"March 31, 2008",A2OW356OMJNAVH,A great product that I\'ll use again,"The Venus Embrace razor is an excellent product.  It gives a clean, smooth shave with no nicks or cuts with minimal passage over the legs.  Unlike double blade or even triple blade razors that I\'ve use in the past, a single well placed passage led to a smooth, hair-free path.  The \'Ribbon of Moisture\' also works well to get a smooth finish. I personally love the shower pod that protects the razor from sitting in moisture and reduces the chances of rusting.  I really enjoyed using this product and will definitely use it again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5818,2123,20100527,B003987CL0,4,"May 27, 2010",A3HUC8541SJ6UT,A Woman\'s Review,"As a woman, I realize I am not the target audience for this razor; I use it to shave my legs.  As such, my review will not apply to men who want to know how it glides on the angles of their face, or how it trims the hair near their nose, etc.  Sorry.If you\'re a woman reading this - here\'s what you need to know:First of all, I\'m a teensy bit OCD when it comes to shaving my legs; I shave them every day and sometimes twice a day.  I know - it\'s stupid - I can\'t help it.  Anyway, I thought a power razor would be an easy way to do a quick shave when I\'m doing a 2nd shave of the day... so I wouldn\'t have to get in the shower a 2nd time.  I imagined that the reason for a power razor was that you could use it dry.  No.You still need wet skin to use this razor, and really - wet skin with some sort of lubricant (body wash, etc) is best.  I don\'t really understand why you need a vibrating \'power razor\' when you still have to have wet skin and shaving cream (or similar) to use it.  What is the advantage of the power?  Why not use a regular razor if you\'re doing all that anyway?  There\'s probably some reason that I don\'t get, and I\'m certainly not going to take away stars for my own ignorance, but I\'m just telling you in case you thought you could use this razor dry.As a razor in the shower, it shaves well.  The shave is close and smooth, with no nicks.  Personally I prefer the Schick Intuition since you can skip using the body wash with that (as it has it\'s own lubricating bar).  But this one shaves very well, and an advantage over the Intuition is that it has a \'floating\' head that goes over bumps like knees more easily and smoothly than a stationary blade like the Intuition.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the replacement heads are pretty pricey, and seem to get dull fairly quickly.BOTTOM LINE:  As long as you know what you\'re getting, it\'s a good comfortable razor that\'s easy to hold and shaves well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purely as replacement cartridges they are very very expensive. (of course Amazon has it on sale right now). There is not much to review on the replacement cartridges.As far as the shaving experience goes, it is absolutely fabulous. It is extremely smooth and saves time while shaving.

Though it will leave white marks if you put on a shirt uncarefully right after, it soaks in and doesn\'t seem to leave those ooky little balls of deodorant.The applicator is one of the ones with little holes at the top. When you turn the dial, the antiperspirant is forced through.Kept me dry during days of outdoor gardening and working out, so it seems to work well.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.

My skin is very sensitive and easily cut and irritated.  For this reason, I love Gillete Venus products, but am overjoyed by the results of this product.My skin was smooth, no bumps and not itchy or red like most times after shaving.The only drawback is if you purchases this for the shower pod, you aren\'t getting anything worth paying more for.  It doesn\'t work really well and I have it stationed above my shower hook because it kept falling down.

5772,2074,20100628,B003987CL0,1,"June 28, 2010",AEA3SJJP7UGJM,What a pathetic razor. I got a better shave with a single blade off brand disposable razor.,"I was not a big fan of the previous Gillette fusion because it irritated my skin and gave me very uncomfortable shaves. I thought that this one would be an improvement and I was excited about getting the pro glide version. Like a dummy I didn\'t test it first and got the bulk set from Costco.This is by far the worst razor ever. There was no gliding at all, it was more like grinding. It irritated the hell out of my skin and it was the most uncomfortable shave ever. It felt as if it was pulling each hair out of my face and I was bleeding everywhere. At first I thought that OK maybe its was this specific blade I was using so I got another blade, the same. The next morning I pulled out  an old unused single blade disposable I had for emergencies and it was much more comfortable then this one. I absolutely hate this razor, I ended up giving away the other unused blades. I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor. Felt great. Best shave ever. This did everyting that the Pro glide promised to do. I had no irritation of the skin and the shave was very comfortable and close.I would NOT recommend this razor at all. I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I thought that this was supposed to the best for sensitive skin...WRONG.Do yourself a favor and don\'t spend you money on this overpriced crap. Get the Shick Hydro or any other disposable razors, they will do a better job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The strip was still mostly green, indicating that it should have been good for additional shaves. The strips on all four blades in the package curled and one fell off. Perhaps there is a manufacturing difference in the blades sold here versus in stores, or perhaps it was just a bad lot.  I would\'ve given the blades I purchased in stores five stars for sharpness and longevity.See the user loaded photo of a blade with a curled strip (if Amazon hasn\'t removed it, again).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2447,1363,20100520,B001F51QJ8,5,"May 20, 2010",A12DQZKRKTNF5E,"Works well, smells good;  for men and women","I\'ve had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I\'m 42 now) I\'ve found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it\'s simply a \'clean\' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don\'t find it competing with my perfume and haven\'t noticed it to be overpowering.Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.The product isn\'t invisible and will get on your clothes if you\'re not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can\'t find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about \'pitting out\' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4227,1609,20090521,B001JQLNFA,3,"May 21, 2009",ASCVKP9B6MI9D,Does the job,"Admittedly, Venus does have some brilliant marketing to be able to constantly repackage what is essentially the same product over and over again. Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn\'t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough. The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin. This interference can also lead to nicks because it\'s difficult to gauge how much pressure to apply to get the razor to meet skin. The gel bars, the selling point of this product, are meant to be a substitute for soap or some other shaving gel. But if you tend to use soap anyway, they are superfluous.That said, this is a decent razor. Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The razor gives the expected 5-blade smooth shave. I tried it myself -- on my face, sillies! The soft green palette is pleasing to the eye, and the shaped handle has a rubberized grip that makes it easy to grasp when wet. The head is large and contoured, ideal for mowing down wide swaths of follicular profusion. The shower caddy is a neat idea. It is backed by two suction cups for gripping the shower stall (tip: works better when wet) that conceals a small, swing-out storage space for extra blades. The swing gets loose easily, so careful! I can\'t speak about price, but typically, 5-blade replacements are fairly expensive, unlike those for my trusty Trac II. Nice product, if the blades last more than a shave or two!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This does reduce wetness by one third (as advertised) over anything else on the market.  When I read the instructions, I was skeptical when it directed me to apply it at night and that a morning application was not needed even after bathing.  I usually exercise in the morning and shower immediately thereafter.  I figured after showering, this would not be effective for the remainder of the day.  Much to my surprise, I did not need a second application and it still provided better wetness reduction than any other antiperspirant I\'ve used in the past.  The scent is similar to baby powder.  It\'s pleasant, yet not over powering.  This product is definitely recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m serious people, you will not be disappointed with this razor.You can say goodbye to cuts and razor bumps with the Proglide Fusion. If you have a problem with razor bumps like I did, here are some tips:1. For the best results, don\'t shave for a week before the first time you use the Proglide Fusion. This will allow for many of your razor bumps to heal.2. Shave in a hot shower. This will open up your pores and make shaving easier.3. Don\'t press the razor hard to your face/neck. Use gentle short swipes as the super thin blades do not require you to gash your face in order to get a close shave.You should also note that this razor has a single blade trimmer on the back side for areas that require precision such as side burns and under the nose.The refills may be expensive, but they are worth it. You can use them several times before they need to be replaced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4215,1596,20090622,B001JQLNFA,5,"June 22, 2009",A28OB1QLXN5BM6,"Silky, Smooth, And Easy To Use","I really like the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE RAZOR.  I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \'made for a woman, not a man.\'  This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.Like the standard (purple) VENUS BREEZE, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR (pale pink) comes with a holder which mounts directly to the wall of your shower or bath.  Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  The three blades are surrounded by gel bars.  There is no need to use shaving cream; just moisten the gel bars to get that silky, satiny feel.  The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme climate.To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  This will help any razor to give you a closer shaver.  While you are soaking, get the cartridge wet, so that the gel gets creamy.  You never want to shave with a dry razor anyway...ouch!  I usually just toss the razor in the tub for a minute or two.  Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  Just one less thing to worry about.The only negative about the VENUS BREEZE is that the gel bars do not last as long as the blades!  With care, the blades in each cartridge last up to a month.  (The triple blades shave my legs so close, that I really only need to shave them every other day.)  But the gel bars either run out or fall off in 2 - 3 weeks.  Then I go back to the shaving cream until the blades give out.Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  I have been satisfied with it for many years.  If Gillette could just make the gel bars last a bit longer...the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2091,1000,20080327,B000XVSNTQ,4,"March 27, 2008",AM004PHO6F3FZ,"No surprises, just clean smooth legs","The latest Venus razor, \'the Embrace\' has just hit store shelves with promises of smoother, easier shaving.  What\'s different?  5 blades!I\'ve used most of the Venus products, thinking (erroneously) that I was leaving less plastic in a landfill by buying a razor with replaceable blades.  The first Venus promised \'the legs of a Goddess\'.  That one had 2 blades.  Somewhere along the line, they\'ve gone to 3, and now 5 blades.  There was even one that took a battery and vibrated a little bit!  But I digress.Out of the box:  a razor, an extra blade package, a suction cup mount for the shower wall.They were truthful, this razor will give you a close smooth shave.  The pivoting head keeps you from cutting yourself, and yes, this works well.  The \'moisture strip\' ensures a smooth glide up your leg.  Its quick, feels nice in your hand, and I got smooth, goddess-like legs without a lot of effort, and without having to stem any bleeding.  5 stars for shaving efficacy.I like the moisture strip because it allows the razor to glide smoothly up your leg without \'skipping\' or scraping.  It seems silly and maybe even gimmicky, but compared to a razor without one, the moisture strip is amazingly helpful.The little plastic gadget is meant to suction cup to the shower wall.  It opens like a little door to reveal a spare blade set.  Nice idea, but it wouldn\'t stick to my shower.  And when it falls off it blows itself to smithereens.  Earlier versions had double stick tape, and the suction cup idea is far preferable, if only it worked.Compared to disposable razors, this is far superior.  It works better, and you don\'t cut yourself.  Compared to other Venus razors, not much difference.  I like them all!  I\'m not convinced that 5 blades are necessary (unless you are a yeti) but all things being equal why not?All in all, highly recommended, watch for a sale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(my first razor was the Gillette Sensor)I do believe this gives me the best shave from Gillette since I started using their cartridge razors.  The problem is that with each new razor comes a price increase.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor cartridges sells for $3.50-$4.00 per cartridge...Ouch!!  Thinking for years that buying the 4 and 8 pack refills was a rip-off, I looked into DE shaving.  I bought an old Gillette Super Speed safety razor and a sample pack Double Edge razor blades and started learning the proper way to shave.  A little math now...at $3.50/cartridge for Gillette Fusion I will spend $182.00/year for razors.  I can\'t use them for more than a week.  In fact the proglide razor seems to lose performance after the 3rd shave for me, but I push it to 6 shaves.  I can buy a 100 pack of Astra DE razor blades for $15.75.  That\'s (rounded up) $.16/razor.  I can use them for 1 week also, so I spend $8.32/year for DE razors.  After a couple month of learning to shave with a DE razor I\'m now getting the same (if not better) results than I get with the Fusion Pro Glide.  The only advantage that the Fusion ProGlide has over old school DE razors is that it is a little quicker, but $173.68 per year in savings is enough to get me off the cartridge razor bandwagon, and into the Double Edge Razor bandwagon.  To me it\'s just common sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don\'t like shaving, and I put it off when I can, but the Powerglide has made shaving so fast that I\'m no longer trying to avoid it.(I want to add that I\'ve now been using these blades for months.

There are 5 blades, all parallel to each other, which is the secret to the close shave. Each blade is sharper than the one above it. The first blade, which is the least sharp, functions to pull the hair out of the follicle a bit, then the second blade cuts the hair and pulls on it some more, then the third blade cuts some more and pulls the hair out even further. Finally, before the hair can snap back, the fourth blade moves in, and cuts the wily hair to infinity. My theory is that the fifth blade is just a marketing ploy and it really doesn\'t do anything. So, if you are willing to spend the money for the closest shave ever, buy this product. Or, if you are out of work because of the economy, you should get a Bic razor from Wal Mart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1818,721,20060321,B000BUW8WM,2,"March 21, 2006",A3PE2ASRMWCDST,Too many blades! More of a scalpel than a razor!,"I like everything about this razor! Design, power indicator, its power which seems to be more powerful than the M3, the aloe strip and the extra blade on the back of it! BUT, this thing has one blade too many in the front, this razor WILL CUT YOU if you are not careful! You could probably kill someone with it! The blades on the cartridges are extremely sharp and shaving time increases to over twice the time as with the Gillette M3, due to that extra fourth blade and the size of the cartridge, which forces you to be extra careful and shave very slowly, so as not to cut yourself. If it only had one less blade in the front, it would certainly be the best razor in the world! Gillette, if you are reading this, consider this advise seriously and remove that fourth blade, because you created one hell of a scalpel. I am rating it two stars, despite the many pluses already mentioned, but since its primary and only purpose is to shave, I cannot honestly say it does a good job. I\'ve used disposable razors that are about $0.49 cents that are faster and better. I do not recommend it, unless they remove that fourth blade.

6286,2596,20060521,B004B8AZH0,1,"May 21, 2006",A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,A big step backwards... don\'t be fooled.,"I began using Gillette\'s Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1921,827,20060619,B000BUW8WM,3,"June 19, 2006",A1KXEQLKPLF71V,If you have a thick beard stick with mach 3,"Been using the mach 3 since it came out. Saw this new fusion on tv and hopped on the boat to try it out. Was I disapointed. I have a thick beard and shaving down or up, I felt like my face was being cut up or like sand paper was going across my face.With the five blade it almost looks like the razer is getting cloged up more easily than the mach 3. The Precision trimmer was pretty useless. Although it did get the side burns pretty straight. Hard to shave around the nose area with the fusion. The head of the razer on the fusion is larger than the mach 3. Blade on the fusion not interchangable like the mach 3, mach turbo, m3 turbo, mach nitro. Marketing I guess to force you to buy a new handle. I felt the quality of the fusion felt more plastic while the M3 turbo I am currently using feels more heavier and well built. The vibration from the fusion although does feel better than the m3 turbo. I also agree with the other post the blades are ridiculously overpriced.All in all I give Gillete Fusion a 3 great idea though.

The blades tend to get expensive (and any Fusion blade will fit this unit---don\'t pay a premium for the package to say \'power\') but are well worth it if you have sensitive skin and desire a smooth quick shave.Some will debate the merits of having the \'power\' function.  Generally I only turn it on to get \'stubborn\' hair that tends to be anchored in - I find the vibrations help get them out - other than that I leave it off.Bottom Line __________  Get the cheapest fusion you can.  At the time I wrote this the regular Fusion was .35 cents more than the power.  If nothing else get this one and try the power out, if it isn\'t for you just remove the battery and you still saved yourself a few cents from the regular version.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

5851,2157,20110622,B003987CL0,1,"June 22, 2011",A2664I2PL9OO7Z,Gimmicky smoothness,"I suppose the Proglide could be of value for those with skin issues.  But for most guys, it simply doesn\'t deliver the closeness the \'old-fashioned\' 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:1) They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  But in the current Proglide commercial, the cartoon is altered to show the second blade doing nothing except scraping the skin, with the hair ending up sticking out above the skin surface.  Major BS here by Gillette.2) If you\'re not comatose, you\'ll notice on their \'Take the Proglide Challenge\' commercials (the one with the used-car salesman guy), they are actually comparing Proglide vs. a DISPOSABLE RAZOR!!!  What does that prove?  How low can Gillette go???Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn\'t totally worthless.  They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  Bottom line is, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  After 2 shaves, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that\'s less close AND less smooth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6322,2632,20110910,B004B8AZH0,5,"September 10, 2011",A335KASNW1CXS0,"The priciest, but also the best","Typically I\'m skeptical of \'premium\' brand names, but I\'ve used mach 3, a few generic razors, and earlier Gillette models, and I have to admit the Gillette Fusion cartridges are the best. Using these blades while sharp I almost never nick myself. My facial hair is a little tough so I used to have trouble getting a clean shave on the first try. With these razors that\'s never been an issue for me.Granted, these are the most expensive razors you\'ll typically see in stores. However, the amazon price is great (especially with subscribe & save). Moreover, using tips I saw on another razor review, I can get an individual Gillette razor to last about a month. By rinsing the gunk off with hot water after shaving, spraying the razor with shower cleaner, then propping it against the wall the durability improves dramatically.Honestly, if I hadn\'t discovered I could make a single razor last a month I wouldn\'t bother buying these. I think they\'re the best, but they\'re not THAT much better than other razors. A dull razor is a dull razor regardless of brand. Yet, if you can make a razor 12 pack last a year, and they\'re so cheap on Amazon, why not buy the best?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The one thing about this product that I found a little different is that I really couldn\'t smell any fragrance with it, so it was hard to even tell if I had it on, one time I forgot if I put it on and I had no way of telling so I had to reapply.  I also had one or two days that I was using this where I still smelled a little bit sweaty by the end of the day, but I think that would happen with just about anything.  Some deodorants cause me to get a red itchy rash and this one did not, so that\'s a plus.

147,152,20091116,B00005AUIE,2,"November 16, 2009",AAYJA4GME03V6,"Was Revolutionary Once, Not Anymore","I\'ve been using the Venus Divine for years but the replacement blades were out of stock at my store of choice so I had to downgrade to the basic Venus blades (all Venus blades work on all handles). I figured it was a couple bucks cheaper and probably just as good. Maybe I\'d save some money in the long run.Unfortunately, I won\'t be saving any money. Although both blades have the same shape and 3 blades, regular Venus blades cut me up without fail. Sometimes I wouldn\'t even notice and I\'d find blood on my white towels or sheets. I noticed a major increase in irritation and even had some bumps become infected. Even my lower legs, which have always been the easiest place for me to get a perfect shave felt rough after using these blades. I\'d always find patches I missed later, too.I always use a very high quality shaving cream to reduce irritation but even it can\'t compete with the amateur performance of Venus blades and I can tell you exactly why. Regular Venus blades do not have the comfort coating, smoothing cushions or multiple moisture strips of the Divine. In my book, those features are definitely worth paying more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does what a deodorant should do and keeps you dry and not smelling like armpits in most situations.  However, I find the Arctic Ice scent to be a bit on the sickly sweet side.  Also while it holds up just fine while going through your daily routine, it does not seem to keep up all that well with the sweat you get from a workout.Personally, I\'m sticking with Old Spice simply because I like the smell better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1817,720,20060324,B000BUW8WM,5,"March 24, 2006",ADQG79SS5N72A,No Problems with Razor Bumps or Folliculitis! Nice Shaver!,"If you suffer from folliculitis, this may just be the razor you were waiting for! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.Also, I bought the Power model but am not sure yet which mode I like best: power or manual. But since you can choose whether or not to turn the power on or not, buying the power model seems best to me. You can get the best of both worlds!In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really didn\'t think this Gillette Fusion Proglide upgrade would be much of an improvement, but to my surprise it was.  I found the razor actually gave a better shave than my previous Gillette provided.The new Proglide is smooth and did the job without punishing my face.  I can shave in the shower without a mirror and the razor glides gently over my face without missing a spot or nicking my skin. If there is one downside to using Gillette Fusion razors it would be the high cost of replacement blades. I suppose one must pay the price for quality and inovation.The new Fusion has a feature that my previous one didn\'t.  The on/off switch is lighted.  OK, that is no big deal, but I really appreciate it because my nearsighted eyes can easily locate the switch to turn off the razor.I recommend buying the Gillette Fusion Proglide even if you already have a previous model of the Fusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m pleased.  The final result of the shave isn\'t any smoother than the non-power Fusion razor--that is, your face won\'t be any smoother after shaving than before--but the shaving process is smoother.  The vibrating head has a numbing effect that takes a shave or two to get used to but makes shaving smoother.

But this Clear Shield product has it in it but does not irritate my skin, so either I\'ve changed or it was because of other ingredients in Right Guard. At any rate, it works for me.

1673,573,20060521,B000BUUVTE,1,"May 21, 2006",A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,This is a terrible razor... a BIG step backwards.,"I began using Gillette\'s Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...)  The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves.  That was an excellent product.  However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model.  I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be.  I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none.  I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal?  Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product?  That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one?  If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off.  I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it.  So much for my customer loyalty.  I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

It took one try to conclude it was totally useless for my purposes.  I have a full beard that is cropped fairly close to the chin line.  I found the Fusion Pro Glide razor head too thick and bulky to perform any type of precision shaving at the edge lines.  Coupled with the trimmer as a handle, it was extremely awkward to use.  I attempted to use the battery operated trimmer along the lip line underneath my moustache and got nothing.  The trimmer is not sharp enough and does not get close enough to cut anything.  Trying to trim the rest of my beard with the snap on combs was an exercise in futility.  The trimmer head is too small and the 3 combs do not provide enough flexibility in terms of hair length.  All in all, I found this product to be a total waste of money.  The best part was the Duracell battery which I removed before throwing the rest in the trash.  Do yourself a favor and don\'t get taken in by s slick marketing campaign designed to sell overpriced razor heads.  If Gillette had spent as much money on the product as they did on the packaging it might be a different story.  There are a number of small rechargeable beard/moustache trimmers in the same price range that out perform this product and a variety of disposable razors that offer more precise shaving.

Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

163,169,20110422,B000065AB0,5,"April 22, 2011",A15NSG16V2LJ8N,Three blades is plenty.,"I bought this from Amazon because I lost my years-old shaver and still had replacement blades left.  I\'ve also got the Gillette Fusion 5-blade shaver, and I definitely prefer 3 blades, especially for travel.  Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my mind, I couldn\'t imagine a more comfortable shave than what I was already getting with my Mach3.  Yesterday, I was at the store to buy a new Mach3 because my old handle had worn down over the years, and I finally decided to give one of Gilette\'s newer razors a try.I ended up getting a manual Fusion Proglide, and I was absolutely thrilled during my first shave with it this morning.  It was by far the best shave I have ever experienced!  The Proglide is so smooth, it hardly felt like there were any blades on the thing as I ran it over my skin.  It felt so nice, I am looking forward to using it again tomorrow morning (instead of waiting my usual two days).Unfortunately, although the razor package that comes with the handle is not much more expensive than some of the older Gilette razors, the replacement blades are noticeably more expensive.  I generally use my blades longer than most, but if you tend to run through new blades pretty quickly, using the Proglide may end up getting costly.  Regardless, I am now hooked on this thing already and will be sticking to this product.  For me, it\'s definitely worth the increased price, because I can\'t imagine having a better shave than what I experienced this morning!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, for those of you still using cheaper and/or disposable razors, the blades on this product seem to last 2-3 times as long.  So although it is more expensive up front, you save money in the long run by having to change the blades less often.  Highly recommended!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had let my beard get out of hand in the last month or so and when I saw this on the television I decided to check it out. The price is what really drew me to the item. I used the clickable coupon that was available on Amazon and I think I ended up paying less than $15 for the item because I\'m also a Prime member. The item arrived 2 days later and I was trimming away. I actually enjoyed using the product. It looks and feels like a quality shaver and trimmer. I also like that it is powered by batteries because I use rechargeable batteries. I actually haven\'t used the shaving part of the unit because I really hate shaving. I was able to trim my beard on my neck so closely that it shaving wasn\'t really necessary. Still I\'m impressed with how the razor attaches and vibrates. I\'m sure I\'ll use it eventually, even if just out of curiosity, lol. Love this purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

Every time they came up with better product until this one. The blade life is so short for fusion and that made me try to use Schick Quattro. I have been using the first blade of Quattro for last 4-5 months and blades stay healthy. Quattro is only just a little less comfortable compared to new fusion but stays fresh for much long. I am not switching back to Gillette.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

These razors make it easy, provide a close smooth shave, and I have never cut myself up with these.  I\'ve been using them for years and they last for about two weeks with regular shaving.  The razors are still sharp after the shave gel is gone, so you can just add your own shave gel and use it like a normal razor to get some more life out of it.  I always spend the extra money on these!  Highly recommended!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

(No woman in their right mind wants to smell like this.) All reported that the product worked well especially during a workout or in gym class. The product did not wear off, lasting well through the day. The boys also wore dark colored shirts and reported no product smear or stain at the end of the day. There was no discoloration after laundering the shirts either.Now for the down side: the product is a bit difficult to get off at the end of the day. A bit of scrubbing in the shower is necessary. (No complaints from me as far as the boys are concerned.) The scent of the product is strong and may be too strong for some/many. Also, it is an antiperspirant as well as deodorant and does contain aluminum, a health concern for some people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It took me about 4 times as long to get the same end result from my old trimmer.

511,521,20100424,B000BUUVTE,1,"April 24, 2010",A2I4UMOUOS5AUD,Terrible,"I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it\'s no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn\'t bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I\'m going to calculate the number of shaves I\'ll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

5802,2106,20100603,B003987CL0,5,"June 3, 2010",A16QODENBJVUI1,My favorite razor has been wonderfully improved,"I\'ve been using the Gillette Fusion ever since it first came out and have been an enthusiastic fan.  There are two things that I have always loved about it.  First, it gives an incredibly close shave.  Other razors cut reasonably close, the using the Fusion there are times when I can run my hand across my face and not detect even the tiniest bit of beard.  Nothing but smoothness.  The other thing that I love about the razor is that I have cut myself using it less than any brand of razor than I have ever used.  One might think that five blades might actually increase the chances of getting cut, but this isn\'t the case.There have been several minor design changes over the past few years.  They have all, however, been rather minor.  Until now, that is.  The new Proglide version of the Fusion is considerably different than the other versions.  The main improvement is that blade now tilts back much more sharply, allowing you to shave at many more angles.  I find that this allows a much better shave than before, especially around the nose.  It is just easier to use than before.  The other major change is that there is a heavier lubricant strip.  Frankly, I\'m not a big believer in lubricant strips.  They don\'t seem to me to aid much in shaving.  But if you think this matters, it is definitely true that the lubricant strip is heavier than on the old blades.So, if you haven\'t used the Fusion series, I definitely recommend doing so.  It is a great razor.  And if you have been using the Fusion, I would definitely recommend the upgrade to the new Fusion Proglide.  It is a great improvement to an already great razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The edge trimmer located at the top of the blade head for line shaping is only average, but the close shave using the blades is smoother than any used before. The three beard trimming combs for length do a great job, but I wished there was a few longer lengths available. I recommend this this styler to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But this razor is the best I\'ve used by far to date. It fits well in the hand, is very lightweight, and gives a close, easy shave. It seems to glide over the skin with a large head which makes shaving time that much less. My legs don\'t feel dry and scratchy afterward but silky and smooth. I love the holder, which can be hung inside the shower, and in which fresh blades can be stored until needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had to throw away the bottle because it was too dangerous. Let me point out that this has never happened to me before with any other body wash that I have tried. It has something to do with the \'thick lather\' technology that they advertise. Not recommended. Two stars because it smells fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m not what one would call hairy so I\'m easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don\'t then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

1699,600,20070816,B000BUUVTY,4,"August 16, 2007",A2CIUQ0BVPC0P8,Pricey but good,"My first time using a powered stick razor.  I definitely get closer shaves when using the power in addition to the 5 blades.  The power is nothing more than a small vibrator motor, like a cell phone, but it provides a closer shave because you end up applying more pressure with slower strokes.  I used to get 2 or 3 days out of the Mach 3 before it was semi-dull.  I can get about a week of close shaves and an additional week of not-so-close shaves out of the Fusion.Overall, the best razor I\'ve ever had.  Also, the most expensive blades I\'ve had to purchase but Amazon\'s subscribe-and-save program is cheaper than Wal-Mart!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve used razors with five blades that hurt like hell and weren\'t easy to use.That said, the Venus Embrace has all the extra features of advanced razors AND performs excellently in all the above three categories.

Of course in comes amazon with a great price on a package of 8 blades for a great price, under $20 and free shipping, that\'s nearly $2.50 per each razor blade. Truly a great deal, I even saved 15% extra because I signed up for an automatic re-order in 6 mnths. Go amazon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2062,969,20080402,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 2, 2008",A3H7ADUP07D93H,Works great but no better than Venus Divine,"When I was growing up razors were a simple affair.  A single blade and that was that.  I remember the first ads when double blades started showing up.  The idea, according to the advertisers, was simple: the first blade would pull the hair so that the second blade could cut it closer to the skin, something that to me defied all logic.  I didn\'t have to worry about it for a long, however, as after a while I switched to depilatories.About a year ago I decided to switch back to shaving and went to buy a razor.  To my dismay, pretty much every model had four blades. What in blazes did anyone need all those blades for?  The heads of these razors were huge.  And why stop at 4?  Why not 6, or 8?  All I wanted was a simple double-bladed razor.  No luck.  I ended up getting the Gillette Venus with three blades and I\'ve been quite happy with it.  Seems someone at Gillette, however, thought that more would be better, or at least more profitable, so when I saw this new red five-headed beast offered through Amazon Vine, I thought I\'d give it a try and see if it was all just marketing hype.  I mean, what the hec? You can always use another razor around the house, right?.  To tell the truth though, I wasn\'t really expecting to like it.  I figured it would be bulky and awkward and just not worth the extra cost of the replacement cartridges.Turns out that this is quite a nice razor in spite of the extra size of the cartridge, which is definitely larger than the three-bladed ones.  First of all, I should point out that all Venus razors accept all Venus cartridges.  I was able to swap cartridges just fine between the new Embrace and my old Venus Divine.  It doesn\'t matter whether you bought a plain Venus, a Venus Divine or a Venus Embrace razor.  You can use any of the replacement cartridges with any of the razors.  The biggest difference between the cartridges is not the number of blades, but the amount of lubrication, as I discovered when I accidentally ordered plain Venus replacement cartridges instead of Venus Divine cartridges.To test out this new razor, I compared it to my old Venus razor with a new plain Venus cartridge, using the new razor on one side of my body and the old one on the other.  Much to my surprise, there was a huge difference in effectiveness as well as comfort between the two, with the Embrace cartridge coming up with much more hair.  Also, the lubrication seemed to smooth over the rough edges of any dull blades.  When you have this many blades, some of them are bound to be dull, but at a cost of about three bucks a pop, you don\'t want to have to throw one out.Okay, this is way too long a review for a stupid razor.  In short, both the Divine and the Embrace are great, better than plain Venus cartridges.  If you already have another Venus razor, though, there\'s no need to buy a new one.  Just get a pack of replacement cartridges.Oh, and by the way -- the blade holder thingy fell off my tile in less than 10 seconds and only holds two replacement cartridges anyway.  Gillette should scrap these things, which are just going to end up in landfills.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5815,2120,20100528,B003987CL0,2,"May 28, 2010",A1S1JC7LTBZAH2,I don\'t get it ...,"This razor seems similar to the regular Gillette Fusion (which is the razor I use), except this one has a AAA battery that makes it vibrate.  The vibration makes this Fusion feel a little like an electric razor -- or how I remember an electric razor feeling, because I haven\'t used one in years.  The sensation wasn\'t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.  In my experience, though, it doesn\'t.  I don\'t feel I\'m getting a shave that is any better or closer than I get with my regular, non-power Fusion.  And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly.  So, this razor isn\'t really delivering a closer shave, it\'s taking me longer to shave, and I found the vibration to be annoying.  It\'s not something I intend to use.  If any of this seems intriguing to you, though, you may want to try it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve kept the original handle, but always tried out the new cartridges when they were released.  Now, this one has a solid soap on top and bottom of the razor blades, to take the place of your shaving cream.  I thought this would be good.I haven\'t cut my legs while shaving for probably 10 years...until today, when I used this razor.  Because the head is very wide (to contain the soap strips), it is difficult to see if you\'re actually cutting the hairs short enough, or maybe you\'re just cutting them \'shorter\' but not shaving them down to the skin.  I found myself pressing very hard to make sure the razor blades would reach the skin, and unfortunately, four times they not only reached the skin but went below it.I won\'t be using the Spa Breeze again.  But maybe this is just me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

1671,571,20060905,B000BUUVTE,2,"September 5, 2006",A3J6GVLYFFCVGB,Not for thick beards,"Let\'s get this straight from the beginning:  I hate shaving.  I have a very thick beard that grows very fast -- if I shave first thing in the morning, I actually need a shave again by 5 o\'clock.  And I have to go over every area at least twice to get a close shave.  I spend an inordinate amount of time doing something that I hate.  So, I will gladly try any new product that promises to make shaving a bit easier.With five blades, the Fusion looked to be the holy grail of shaving.  I\'ve been using a Mach 3 for years, and it works better than just about anything else (though my Panasonic linear electric is great in its own right).  I figured if three blades are good, five should be better.  Right?Well, unfortunately not.  The five blades on the Fusion are on a head about the same size as the Mach 3, which only has three blades.  This means the blades on the Fusion are much closer together, which Gillette says will give you a closer shave.  This might be true for average beards, but if you have a thick beard, the blades are actually TOO close together.  I find that the Fusion just kind of skips over my whiskers without cutting, especially if I shave with the grain.  So, I actually have to spend a longer time shaving with the Fusion than I did with the Mach 3, and I have to go against the grain more often.  I\'ve switched back to the Mach 3.However, one thing I really do like on the Fusion is the single blade on the back.  That is really excellent for shaving those hard to reach areas under the nose, and for straightening out sideburns.  I just hope they come out with a Fusion Platinum Edition or something, with a bigger razor head that spreads the blades out a bit more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were a little more expensive than other razors but they were worth every penny!

2409,1325,20090326,B001F51QJ8,3,"March 26, 2009",A3N9TOPHBENB9I,A perfectly adequate product,"I obtained this product through the Vine program for a male member of my family to evaluate.  First thing he noticed was that he had to turn the wheel (pushing the product upward) many many times to get it to reach the surface where it could be used.  Therefore, it is obvious that the container is not completely full, and therefore the user is actually getting less product than the size of the container would imply.  The directions say \'three clicks.\'  Yeah, right.  That may be true after the first use, but certainly not true for the initial use.  Also, the name of the anti-perspirant includes the words \'advanced solid,\' but the stuff that exuded from the little holes in the top sure looks like a thick cream.Other than that, all he could say about the product is that it seems to be a perfectly adequate anti-perspirant.  Even though he is a very active guy, he was neither negatively nor positively impressed.  Maybe he had a rather neutral reaction to it because he is just not the type of guy who stays awake at night wondering if he has damp spots on his shirt in the summertime that might gross-out his coworkers.In any case, he felt that the product does the job, but he wondered if it was worth the price differential over other brands.  For roughly the same amount of money, one can purchase four-packs of other name-brand anti-perspirants that work (in his estimation) just as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don\'t think I can say that about any other razor I\'ve tried.The downside is that I can never get a close shave with these blades. No matter how many times I try or how many different directions I shave the same area, it still feels a little stubbly. By the end of the day, I feel like I need a shave again.

You will receive a plain white box with two cartridges inside. In fact, these blades are not better then cheap no-name or some store\'s brands. Not really sharp from the start, in few days they becames useless. Some blades has the burrs therefore scratches and blood are inevitable.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

In comparision the replacement baldes on the new proglide online range from about 3.50 to 4.00 before shipping per blade. Defnitley a smooth shave with the vibration or without. I like this better than the original fusion for since it lights less bulky and the razor head itself seems smaller and therefore closer to my face. I also like the straight edge but for someone who would do precision shaping on a goatee this is not the best choice.

I typically have to repeat the shave in each area (twice in each leg, twice in each under arm ect ect) because my other razors just didnt give me a close enough shave the first time around. The five blades in this razor really gave me a tremendous close shave. The first time around with both legs my skin was baby soft and completely hairless it made the whole shaving experience 2x as fast and easier. I used the olay/gillette shaving gel but it was not necessary the blade of this razor is in between two very large olay moisture bars. After my shave my skin felt so extremely soft. I have super sensitive skin and it didn\'t get irritated by this product. Strongly recommend, i would definitely repurchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5745,2047,20100810,B003987CL0,5,"August 10, 2010",A99BPI4IGPB2Y,Best Gillette ever -- and it\'s actually CHEAPER!!,"I won\'t repeat what some of the other reviewers have said about how well the new Power Proglide shaves, but suffice it to say, it\'s the most comfortable shave I\'ve ever experienced (and I have a very sensitive neck). It\'s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.  To the couple of reviewers that say they couldn\'t tell the difference, I\'d say you\'re either shaving wrong or do not have sensitive skin.  With the Fusion Power, I\'d pretty much have to shave in the shower to avoid razor burn on my neck.  With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving -- no razor burn at all (or ingrown hairs), even shaving against the grain on my neck.Here\'s what a lot of the reviewers are missing. On the Fusion Power, I had to change blades every 7-10 days. Any more than that and I\'d get torn up. I\'m in my TENTH week of using the Power Proglide blades, and I\'m on my THIRD BLADE!!! It\'s JUST about time to change, but I could still probably handle another shave or two with no less comfort than I had with the regular Fusion Power blades. 3 BLADES in 67 days!!  And the other cool thing is that these blades work perfectly on the Fusion Power chassis, so no need to buy the new Power Proglide razor (unless you just want to upgrade for the looks).So yes, individually, the blades ARE more expensive than any other blade. But the cost savings, even over just a year, will be SIGNIFICANT for me -- almost $60/year vs. the Fusion Power... AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHAVE EVER??? It\'s a no brainer!!Update:  Still LOVING this shaver almost a year later.  I did determine that what you\'re using for shaving cream makes a BIG difference.  I\'ve used Neutrogena for Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream for years, but decided to try an organic one from Kiss Your Face.  Lots of razor burn and discomfort with that cream, even with a brand new blade (tried it for two days).  So, back to the Neutrogena and couldn\'t be happeier with the Fusion Power ProGlide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5589,1889,20100902,B003983HRI,5,"September 2, 2010",A1VBHX96TQPUXK,Really surprised,"So for about the past 20 years I\'ve been using an electric razor, different brands but lately its been a braun.  When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

I found the shave to be close and my legs were amazingly smooth after using it (almost as if I had used some kind of baby lotion or shaving cream on my legs).

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

It\'s all sizzle and not too much substance.  Don\'t get me wrong you\'ll get a good shave, relatively speaking.  But I\'ve had better shaves with other less costly razors. I\'ve used the Fusion, both manual and power, and the Mach 3.  After shaving for a number of years with both Fusion power and manual, I\'ve detected no difference between a \'power\' shave and a manual one. The Proglide is no different.  The \'power\' option with battery and all sounds great, but doesn\'t work at all.  It\'s a placebo and an expensive one at that.I\'m going back to using Mach3.Here\'s a tip that has really served me well:  use hair conditioner rather than shaving foam, and you will get a much closer shave.  At first, I didn\'t believe a friend of mine when he gave me this tip.  But it\'s true.  I get much closer shaves.  And the other great benefit is that your razor blades last much, much longer.  Instead of a razor blade lasting me for a couple of weeks, tops, when I use foam, my blade is good for six to eight weeks when I use hair conditioner. Needlessly to say, now I only use hair conditioner for shaves.  And I don\'t have to tell you, this translates to not only getting great shaves, but to saving a lot of money!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I like best about these razors is no shaving cream or additional lather is required. Just wet the blade and shave away. It couldn\'t be easier. I *hate* to shave and this definitely makes the whole experience a lot more pleasant and easy. The blades are a bit more expensive then the cheap, pink daisy razors that I have always used, but they last for a long time.I have been changing the blade about once every 10 days and I typically shave every other day.

1920,826,20060621,B000BUW8WM,4,"June 21, 2006",A2032YC2PRGNSR,Long-time Mach III user had to upgrade,"Disclaimer:  I\'ve used the Mach III for my barely-less-hairy-than-an-ape face since it came out in the early-90\'s.  The Mach III served me well, but the head kept coming off, the result of dropping it about 4 dozen too many times.  I\'ve been a Gillette user for a couple of decades, now, but I\'m open to anything which works.  Hint:  I consider any electric, as much as I\'d like to have one, useless.  I\'ve had a few, it was a waste of money for me, but my friends got exceptionally good hand-me-downs.I was *ULTRA-SKEPTICAL* about a 5-bladed razor, *especially* a \'powered\' one.  I mean, my triple-bladed beast was still cranking along, and after 15+ years, I\'ve become accustomed to having my facial hair more pulled out than cut.  It\'s a genentic thing not many people seem to suffer from, which is good for the greater population.  Put it this way, I have \'5 o-clock shadow by 10 AM\'.  It\'s not a good thing.  If I skip shaving for 36 hours, I start to look like a psycho-drifter who has been on the road for a few weeks.Anyway, I sprung for the powered version, figuring I could use all the help I could get.  Shockingly, no pun intended, the shave was not only *amazingly* close, but I didn\'t have the typical 2-5 cuts from having a new blade.  To make matters better, I mananged to have even sideburns for a change.I\'ve been in Vegas about a year and the mid-to-late-70\'s fat Elvis has started to transchannel my sideburns.  Not mutton-chops...yet, but they\'re obvious.  ;-)Anyway, after not my first, but third powered-Fusion shave, about six hours after shaving (at which point I\'d ususally give my wife a rash if I gave her more than a peck on the cheek) I said to her, \'hey, feel my chin.\'  I got an immediate \'WOW!\'  It\'s so nice to look normal for an entire day.There are downsides.  Blades are stupidly expensive and don\'t seem to last more than a week, but the behavior was similar with my Mach III.  I\'ve considered having a ton of cartridges treated with near absolute zero cold, as that appears to help longevity, but have never gotten around to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

161,167,20111216,B000065AB0,5,"December 16, 2011",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,Better than the Schick Quattro,"***Note: I added this review from the regular Mach 3 since the actual starting system is nearly identical to the regular Mach 3, just this one has an extra lubricating strip on the blades. I go between the two as far as replacement blades and whichever is on sale. They are pretty similar, and either of the blades actually fit on either the razors.I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago. I have since tried a few new models thinking that perhaps one of these new razors might work better... but I keep coming back to this razor.The Mach 3 is so far, the only replaceable blade razor that I have found I can easily, properly shave my head without nicks and cuts. The blades tend to wear fairly quickly compared with the Shick Hydro 5, but what is the use of longer lasting blades that slice my head to ribbons?The grip is a great improvement on the Sensor XL, more heft, better wet grip. The blades are easy to attach and remove. They last me a couple of weeks on average, but I shave my head every two to three days and shave my neck below my beard every day. That\'s a lot of use.I did start using a new shave gel and it works magically with the razor. No more issues with serious gumming up of the blades. Check out King of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.. It\'s expensive for a shave gel, but nothing works better for shaving my head and preventing the shave gel/cream from gumming the blades.I know the replacement blades are expensive, and many third party sellers are reselling stolen merchandise... but that\'s part of why they are expensive. Those of us who are buying the blades on the up and up are paying for all those stolen and re-sold packages. So I just recommend buying from a store or trusted seller rather than eBay. Also watch for replacement blades not sold in retail packaging. Often these are either knock offs or have \'fallen off a truck\'. Spend the extra $5 and make sure you are getting the quality blades from a reliable source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1974,880,20100908,B000MLNVU8,1,"September 8, 2010",A3OPU7SM2MB1W,Disappointed in the Gillette Fusion,"I have been using this razor for about 5 weeks now.  The razor works fine without the power feature which vibrates the blade.  At first, I liked the power feature and used it for about one week, but then I just found it a bit annoying and haven\'t used it since then.  The power feature actually slows you down a bit as you cant rush the blade over your stubble as I have become used to doing after a hot shower in the morning.  I can tell that using 5 blades gives me a slightly closer shave than my previous razor with 3 blades (the mach 3) but I honestly don\'t care about the slight difference.  Hence I have come to the conclusion that this is not much of an advance in shaving technology, in a strange way, it is actually a step backwards as the prices of blades have gone up without a real noticeable enhancement in my shave.

I shaved like normal - but didn\'t `feel\' the shave.  Normally I can feel the blades as they rub on my skin - this was different.  I ran my hand up & down my leg to be sure it even worked - It Did!  Wow!!The head of the razor is bigger than I\'m used to, but the only time this really makes a difference is when shaving my armpits.  (Did I really just mention my armpits in one of my reviews!?!)Because of how soft this shave really is - I decided to test it against my usual razor.  I shaved one leg with each razor.  Both were smooth and both grew back at the same rate.  If there\'s no difference - why wouldn\'t you choose the SOFT shave!!!  Seriously - I don\'t feel those blades - this makes me excited for swimsuit season ... (then again, I won\'t be putting on a swimsuit anyway!!)This razor comes with a case for the replacement blades that you can hang in the shower and that you can hang the razor on.  I could not get mine to stay put no matter what I tried.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

I need a deodorant that will go on dry and comfortable, but one that will also go on clear, and not stain darker clothing.With their Clear Shield line, Gillette does just that.To put it simply, Gillette\'s product gets the job done. It goes on dry and clear, and gives long-lasting odor protection that lasts all day. I put this on every morning before work, and several hours later when I get home, it\'s still working for me.If there\'s one negative (and from what I can tell, other reviewers will back me up on this), it\'s that the scent is a bit too \'sweet.\' It\'s almost as if Gillette was trying to create a product men and women alike could comfortably use - and in that aspect, the end result is questionable. They really need to get more scents out, and specific ones for men and women, not one that\'s just a compromise.Negatives considered, this is still a top-notch product. It goes on dry and clear and gives long-lasting odor protection. It\'s still more than good enough to earn this reviewer\'s recommendation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I compared it to the Mach 3 and this is what I\'ve determined:PROS:1. Very close, smooth shave. It is noticably closer than the Mach 3.2. Less pulling than the Mach 3.3. Razor handle has a nicer and more expensive \'feel\' to it. It has a little heft, so to speak.CONCERNS / ISSUES:1. The razors are materially more expensive than the Mach 3. It\'s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money. If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I\'d go with this one.2. The razors are thinner. I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.3. Amazon has great info and instructions. The razor itself does not. It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box. For example, I really wasn\'t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head. I might have appreciated some of the features more if I had understood what they were for and that is not always obvious from the packaging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1638,538,20080713,B000BUUVTE,3,"July 13, 2008",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,"Over-priced, Over-bladed","The Gillette Fusion is Gillette\'s latest (as of this writing) offering to the world of manual shaving. Featuring five blades and a stunning new razor design, the Fusion is a truly attractive razor. But is it \'the best a man can get\'? Not for this man.Aesthetics: 4 stars. The Fusion design is truly excellent and far superior to other razors. The handle has been greatly extended compared to the Mach 3 handle, and a noticeable amount of weight and girth has been added as well. This is a razor that will feel comfortable in almost any man\'s hand. The blade cartridge itself keeps this razor from getting 5 stars in my opinion. Fusion cartridges are about the same size as cartridges for the average razor for women. This will require many men to slightly alter the way they shave their faces; however, the one-blade trimmer (on top of the razor) helps a good bit.The shave: a disappointing 3 stars. The Fusion gave me an incredibly close shave. I mean incredibly close. My face hasn\'t been that smooth since I was a child. I thought the trimmer worked well for its purpose. But -- and this is a big \'but\' -- the shave was honestly too close for comfort. After every shave with the Fusion, my face felt extremely sensitive for the rest of the day. I cannot help but believe that the 5-blade design caused the discomfort that I felt after using the Fusion. Perhaps other men will not have this issue. For those with sensitive skin (like me), your best bet might be to avoid the Fusion.Blade durability: 4 stars. This was where the Fusion blades really shined. With most razors, I typically have to change blades once a week. With the Fusion, I used the same blade for 2 weeks with no trouble at all. The blade still felt fresh after a week, and drag was minimal into the second week.Overall: The razor was decent. Certainly an impressive shave, but perhaps too close for some due to the unneccesary number of blades. The biggest problem with the Fusion is that the blades are insanely expensive. In my opinion, the cost of Fusion blades diminishes everything else that might be good about it.UPDATE: Decided to give the Fusion another shot by buying an entirely new system with a new blade. Still an incredibly disappointing razor with lots of irritation. It\'s just one or two blades too many. I cannot say the shave is any closer than a Schick Quattro or even a Gillette Sensor Excel on a good day. Would be nice to see Gillette take this razor design, with the longer handle and closer blade spacing, and port it over to a 3-blade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought for him and when I received it I thought it would make a great Valentines\' gift to him from our daughters. He loves using it and has thrown out all other razors. It really leaves his face smooth and soft. A great razor all around!! Would highly recommend this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it seems to be bit more smoother than older Fusion when I shave with the grain, I don\'t see any difference when I shave against the grain. It seems to struggle just as the older fusion against the grain. 3 STARS because the hype that Gillette put behind this product is not justified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1660,560,20061223,B000BUUVTE,3,"December 23, 2006",AOEDWQLH2WKKW,Doesn\'t work well if you shave infrequently,"I found that this razor doesn\'t work as well as my Mach 3 for infrequent shaves.  The blade spacing is much closer than the Mach 3 so it requires many more passes to take off the long hairs.  I find the single blade on the back side handy to trim unruly nose hairs and around the lips.I received this as a free sample from Sam\'s and I won\'t buy more, but if a person shaved more than once or twice a week it might be a good investment, as it does get a close smooth shave.  I used this razor with Gillette\'s razor gel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have much more of our bodies to shave than they do.  Anyway, this razor is really nice with a flashy colorful handle and nice grip.  The packaging was a bit much.  It did very well around the ankles, knees, behind the knees and under the arms it was nice and gentle.  I only had to do one pass over the bikini area which really cuts down on the rash, I appreciate that.  It was a nice clean, smooth shave.  Now they just have to make it in shades of baby blue and pink and market it to us gals.The razor did come with one battery and I installed it and did use the vibration while I shaved but I\'m not sure what it was for or if it made it better in any way.  I\'d use this razor without it but it is a nice gimmick and I was excited to see what it felt like but I actually forgot it was on while I was shaving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5908,2214,20120214,B0039LMT9C,5,"February 14, 2012",ADS5APY1NKTL4,Very pleased with this razor....,"it has been many moons, since the first time I started shaving my legs and underarms. Subsequently, I have tried many different types of depilatories (lotions, potions, waxes, razor blades and the like). God knows, I have the cuts and scars to prove it. If you looked at my legs, you would see a road map of scrapes from past dalliances with razors. Many have come and gone. Frankly, I was often not even looking for quality - I was just looking for a quick, (relatively) fast way to remove unwanted stubble.Low and behold - I happened to read some reviews of Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, complete with 1 Razor and 2 Women\'s Razor Refill Cartridges. The women who used them seemed pleased, so, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring. Sure enough, the simply packaged product arrived at my home, just yesterday. In need of a touch up job, I decided to try my hand at this blade. I must say, I was very pleased. It didn\'t feel like I was even shaving! That was how smooth the razor glided down my legs, and under my arms. The moisture strip definitely did the trick. No ashy, flakey skin or the pain I come to associate with razor burn. The shave was close, too. I don\'t see stubble, after nearly twelve hours - which is unheard of, for me. I am from Lebanese/Latino/Indo European stock. We grow our hair with pride...So, yes, I will try this razor again. Good show.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

5870,2176,20101221,B003987CL0,4,"December 21, 2010",A3R33KMESG0XGQ,"Good, but only for a while.","I\'ve been using Gillette since my first razor--which, incidentally, was my first razor--and they have treated me well over the years.  Despite their abundantly mass-produced stock, they have been well-built (some more than others) and have stood the test of time.  These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I\'m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  While Gillette\'s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  Where I know some bumps on my cheeks and chin should be, the vibration may confuse me and cause me to improperly shave and leave some spots thicker than others.The blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I\'m considering doing the ol\'-fashioned wet shaving.All in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first day I grabbed the Fusion ProGlide with my hand I noticed a big difference in the handle. Just like everyone is saying you definitely feel a much more better grip in your hands. I was impressed when Gillette came out with the Fusion razor thinking wow this is the razor I will use forever, but when they came out with the Fusion ProGlide I was blown away. To this date I am STILL using the FIRST blade that came with the razor..... Yeah you heard right the FIRST BLADE. I bought it about 2 months ago and each time I shave it feels so good. No more irritations, no more having to feel that your beard is getting pulled, no more razor bumps at least for me. Once my beard grew back I shaved with my old razor the Gillette Fusion don\'t get me wrong it\'s a great product but after 4 to 5 times one shaves I started to notice all of the above I have mentioned. Especially the redness after I shaved half of my face. I switched to the Fusion ProGlide to finish the other half of my face and let me tell you it was the best feeling ever on my face it truly does glide. Like a hot knife cutting through a stick of butter. I use to hate shaving but with this new product from Gillette I enjoy shaving once again and most importantly this will save me a lot of money when buying the blades. They will last longer trust me on that. I recommend this Fusion ProGlide to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6289,2599,20060323,B004B8AZH0,5,"March 23, 2006",ADQG79SS5N72A,Doesn\'t Provoke Folliculitis!,"If you suffer from folliculitis, this may just be the razor you were waiting for! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Also, before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had tried the MachIII razor before and felt that it was gimmicky, as it didn\'t seem to shave any better than a double blade razor, but cost a lot more.A few years ago, I got a free sample Gillette Fusion razor in the mail and I gave it a try.  Wow!  This thing actually shaved me well, didn\'t but me up and even had a nice trimming blade on back.  I thought that a four blade razor would be too wide/long to shave well, but I was wrong.  The best part about the Fusion is that the blades last a LONG time.  I mean it\'s nothing for me to get two or three months out of a single blade.  Amazing.The only downside is that they are expensive, but considering how well they shave and how long they last, I still come out ahead.

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

It seems to be the angle. This razor takes up a larger area than the sensor, so it doesn\'t reach into areas like clefts or turns (chin area, jaw line) as well. It works better on a flat area, like legs for example. My fiancee uses it for shaving her legs and likes it better, but I don\'t care for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I rate it 4 stars just because its not as wonderful as some of the other venus razors, but thats why its a bit cheaper. I knew that before I bought it. There is not much of a difference in the closeness of the shave but more so in shaving; the venus embrace has these moisture strips so after the first time (it takes time for the water to soak in) you don\'t even have to use shaving cream for the next several times till the moisture strips wears out. However, I am not sensitive when it comes to shaving and have no problem using shaving cream (hair conditioner) and the shave is almost as close as any other venus. If money were no problem, i would choose venus embrace though. I\'ve also tried the divine and that is nice too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This doesn\'t rehydrate it immediately, but it\'s one of the hygiene products I switched. It\'s definitely thick and gives a nice lather, don\'t put too much of it on at once (which is what the other reviewers tried). I definitely like this one better than Old Spice\'s offering.

The Mach 3 was a revolutionary idea at the time. It gave me much better shaves than Norelco or those horrible BIC shavers. Now with the Gillette fusion, I get better shaves and a long lasting blade. I shave in the shower because the wet hair is easier to shave than dry hair. I also use the tip of keeping the blade in down so gravity draws everything away from the blades. A really great product and system from Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

479,489,20060209,B000BUUVTE,2,"February 9, 2006",A2D6VOCNGBDVF3,"Keeps getting clogged, takes about the same amount of time overall","I usually use a Gillette Sensor with 2 blades (although my latest pack has 3 blades) and I\'m generally happy with it.  I visited my friend couple of days ago and I had to borrow his razor, which was the Fusion.  The problem with this blade (and also the Quattro, and also to some degree the 3 bladed razors) is that because the blades are so close together, the cut hair gets stuck between the blades more easilly.  This requires more time rinsing between strokes, so it overall doesn\'t save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive, so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it\'s important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades (compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel) helps in shaving large parts of skin, like legs or whatever.  But when it\'s your face with its nooks and crannys, I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort. The 6th blade feature was OK, but didn\'t feel like it was worth it.Remember, that with any NEW blade, you will get an awesome shave.  People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it, because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they\'re reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit----Recently got this as a gift.  Same problems as listed before.  I\'ll just use it until I run out of blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s probably only costing the companies 15 or 20 cents to produce each of these razor heads, if that - it\'s a little bit of flimsy molded plastic, some sharpened blades, some rubber and a moisturizing strip.  That\'s it.  I don\'t want to dump my money on a $100+ electric razor, so I\'ve started to look towards the off brand razors, and have settled on Target\'s reuasable Up razor.  The Target cartridge sells for $5.25, about a third of the price of the Schick/Gillette equivalents, and the heads are each lasting for 3-4 more shaves than my Mach 3 Turbos were good for.  I\'ve heard that some of the drug stores have started to carry their own off brand reusable razors as well.  Look around and give them a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6293,2603,20060206,B004B8AZH0,4,"February 6, 2006",A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,Nice Shave But I\'ll Stick With The M3 Power,"I have been using Gillette\'s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it\'s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette\'s other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6255,2565,20080127,B004B8AZH0,5,"January 27, 2008",A1VS1LL905P5L5,Hmm...so it wasn\'t just a gimmick,"I received these cartridges by mistake instead of the Mach3\'s ordered.  The idea of 5 blades that are battery operated to vibrate in an orange handle seemed like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Very gimmicky and overkill and bordering on kitsch.  But rather than going through the hassle of returning them I popped in the battery after rolling my eyes at this corporate invented need and gave it a try.  As much as I wanted to hate it, I found it to be a definite notch up the shaving food chain.  The blades are very sharp and the vibration somehow seems to allow the head to glide more smoothly and evenly over the beard.  The shave and closeness were the best I\'ve ever experienced.  Even the single blade on the opposing edge for maneuvering in tight crevices like under the nose worked perfectly.  All this comes with a cost.  When I surfed over to see what the cartridges actually cost I was horrified.  Soon they\'ll need to be locked in a glass container at the grocery store with an armed guard in front of the display.  Second, not sure if it\'s planned obsolescence engineered into the cartridges, but the blades seem to last only a few shaves, making them even more costly.  The blades being mounted so close to each other also make them hard to rinse and they clog easily.  Buying in larger quantities lowers the cost per unit somewhat.  Personally, I\'m hoping beards come back into style to create some downward pricing pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	1	""April 24, 2010",A2I4UMOUOS5AUD,Terrible,"I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it\'s no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn\'t bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I\'m going to calculate the number of shaves I\'ll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1841,744,20060202,B000BUW8WM,5,"February 2, 2006",A4X8RHD9S8LUF,"Yes, it\'s better than the Mach3","I used my Fusion Power this morning for the first time.  I have pretty thick facial hair, though it is not especially fast-growing (no big problems with five o\'clock shadow and I only shave every two or three days - though on day three, I\'m pretty grizzled). The Fusion gave me the closest shave ever - especially on my neck around the Adam\'s apple, which is an always-difficult area. I usually find a few stray stubbles, even with my Mach3 Power that I\'ve been happily using for quite some time, but today my neck was smooth and clean with no \'re-do\'.The five blades of the Fusion are closer together and thus occupy about the same amount of space as the three blades of the Mach 3.  This results in a very smooth feel to the shave - you don\'t feel the five separate blades, just one shaving surface.  I did feel some tugging on the heaviest parts of my beard (I hadn\'t shaved since Sunday morning).I also found I didn\'t need to go back to \'re-shave\' certain areas.  My facial hair is pretty dense and there are certain spots on my upper cheeks, directly under my jaw and on my neck that I tend to miss or just don\'t get a close shave on the first go-round.  This wasn\'t a problem with the Fusion.The extra sixth blade works exactly as described and is a fantastic addition.  I was able to easily (and accurately) straighten out my sideburns and get those few stray and hard-to-get-at hairs under and next to my nose.Overall, I\'m very impressed.  I recognize that there is a certain amount of hype surrounding new introductions from Gillette - but it seems like they really do their homework.  When they first came out with Mach3 Power, it seemed like a gimmick - but I found it gave me a closer and more comfortable shave.  Now, with the Fusion, it feels like another leap forward in shaving technology...  I\'m sold and give the Fusion Power my unqualified recommendation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6138,2446,20100714,B004B8AZH0,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She found the handle to be easy to grip, the gel area around the head to be comfortable and the wall holding unit to be well designed and useful. She also stated that the shave from this razor was closer than most she has tried.The only drawback to the razor is the replacement blades, which, when compared against disposable razors, can run into some money.

This cost savings is further multiplied by the fact that, in order to fit more blades on those other razors, the blades are made much thinner and are more prone to wearing out. So a sensor blade like these are much cheaper and seem to last longer.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

There is room inside the pod to store extra razor cartridges and the cartridges are individually sealed to stay clean and dry when stored in the shower. The razor itself has five blades and a soft grip handle that makes the razor pleasant to hold and use.I had some misgivings about trying the Venus Embrace razor because any time I\'ve used disposable razors in the past, I ended up with painful nicks and cuts all over the place. I was pleasantly surprised once I used the razor. The shave was so smooth that I actually thought it wasn\'t working until I checked the razor and my leg. The five blades do a great job of shaving. It did take a few attempts for the shower pod to stick on the shower wall, but once it did stick the razor fit neatly into the pod and it proved to be very handy. The blades face against the shower wall, so there\'s no fear of accidentally brushing against it and cutting yourself. The fact that there\'s room inside the pod for extra cartridges is terrific, in case you need to change the cartridges mid-shave. It is very easy to change the cartridges, which is a plus. However, the extra cartridges are not cheap, which is a minus.The Venus Embrace razor is one of the best razors that I\'ve ever used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5768,2070,20100702,B003987CL0,1,"July 2, 2010",AU70G084OYMMM,Nothing special about this razor when compared to the others.,"I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age. The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better but that was always not the case. So I\'ll briefly compare this to the other razors I\'ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel. The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade. Thats all I have to say about that.The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner. Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same. So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave but I still decided to stick with the comfort of the Mach 3. So up till now the Mach 3 was my razor of choice.Now the story changes a bit:I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided. I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking I would never use anything else. BAD DECISION!!!! My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power. At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I\'m getter older so it\'s my skin\'s fault. I would get ingrown hairs and it was then embarrassing to go out. I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved. I tried various skin treatments to rid of the irritations and redness but nothing would work. The problem with the fusion was that the blades would only last about 3 shaves and then irritate the hell out of your face. ONE DAY I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY ANOTHER RAZOR.I then bought the Schick Quattro Titanium and boy was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion. It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever. They would stay sharp for months and wouldn\'t clog if a shave gel was used.(I know people complain that it clogs but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh it doesn\'t).Now Hydro 5 vs. Fusion ProglideHydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5. At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water. The shave was not as close as I would have wanted. The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge. Still I kept on using it since it came with 2 refills anyway. The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.Fusion Proglide: I bought the sneak peek package just to try the razor before it came out and all I can say is AWFULLLLLL!!!!!!! This time I couldn\'t even get one good shave from this crap. Turns shaving into gliding my A$$!!!! It\'s very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot. So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I\'ve ever used so far. The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind the exaggeration but you know what I mean).Final verdict: Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers. They are nothing but marketing now. Up until the Mach 3 they were my razor brand but the fusion and fusion proglide are nothing but scams. They look cool but I think they are face wreckers. Then again I have sensitive skin so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise. Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help. So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin. It will not clog with Zirh or Anthony Logistics shave gel and causes no irritation. The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates. Sorry for long review but I just had to share my experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It dries pretty quickly so I didn\'t notice it for long. After removing the lid, the deodorant comes up through these 50 holes in the sub-lid. It\'s wide enough for a huge underarm so a lot was wasted as the product cannot be rolled back down. It does work, I loved the way it didn\'t let me get wet at all.  But, I think I know the reason for that. I don\'t know what the deodorant has in it but after about the third day I had it on, I noticed that at the end of the day my underarms were sticky....hard sticky. That night in the shower I couldn\'t get it off.  The only thing I can akin it to is the feeling that 80\'s fry-baby might have now. The sticky that comes from not removing all of the grease from the outside of the baby.  Just sticky.  I quit using it then.  Even after repeated washings with my hand and a washrag, it took me another two days to get it from under my arm.  I gave it to my husband to use and he hasn\'t complained. Of course, he does have hair and tends to use a liquid deodorant anyway.Another thing that bothered me was that upon looking underneath the sub-lid, the product was almost gone.  I know I didn\'t use that much of it so maybe it got hot in shipping.If you can stand the sticky feeling...but love to be dry...this is the product for you.....and my husband.I wish it had been better for me, I have stock in PG.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My commute to and from work involves a good deal of walking. Over the years of trying different antiperspirants (Old Spice, Arm & Hammer, Right Guard, etc...) I had finally found something that protected me all day...Degree. I\'d get into work with my shirt looking like I\'d just went through a bit of a downpour, but my armpits were covered.So Degree is my standard of performance to which I judge the Gillette by.I also have a favorite scent of Degree (Power, which used to be Powder...But I\'m guessing the Marketing team thought men would have an easier time picking up Power). In essence my Degree serves as my antiperspirant and cologne.Using the Gillette is certainly different and away from the norm...Instructions state that the product should be applied before going to sleep and you\'ll be all set for the following entire day! Supposedly you could even take a shower and still be protected!As well, the stuff goes on clear and clean. The next morning you don\'t even know you\'ve got anything on, and it delivers on its\' promise of all day protection as well.This product really is an excellent antiperspirant, the only reason I didn\'t give it a full 5 stars is that I feel too high a premium is asked for this product. Even at the current sale price, I can get almost 2x more of my usual Degree antiperspirant at 1/2 the cost of just 1 of these Gillettes (yes, taking into account that this is a 2pack of Gillettes)!!If you don\'t mind the premium though, and you want something clean, clear and WORKS as promised...Then I wholeheartedly recommend this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I got mine as a Christmas Present 2 years ago.  It took me just over 4 months to use the three cartridges that came with it.  There is no downside.  It was both the best shave, as well as the most economical one I had ever experienced.  I admit that I was a little taken back by the cost when I finally ventured out in the spring to buy some replacements.  Around here they either lock them away in some little Fort Knox in the store, or even enclose them in security boxes that sound an alarm if you try to open it or run out the door.  I can only imagine that too many men, (and some women too) have considered larceny over cheaper blades if they can\'t afford the fusions.  The fusion cartridges may be a little steep, but the truth is 8 of them in a pack can easily get your average Joe through an entire year of shaving. Here on Amazon, I got 8 refills for $20 and free shipping!  That\'s not only a good $5.00 cheaper than the best place here, but that\'s not including the savings on the sales tax.  Believe me when I tell you that I spent over an hour one night searching for replacement blades online and finally settled on Amazon as unbeatable.  Nobody even came close with the free shipping.  If you\'re not already a Gillette fusion shaver, become one.  If you are, buy the cartridges here.  Amazon not only has the best price for them but it is actually easier and more convenient to buy here.  You will never be tempted to resort to larceny....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I loved that it came with a replacement head and that it had a storage rack with suction cups, so it could be placed out of the reach of children.  The razor itself had a great \'soft\' grip and a nice wide moisture strip.  But...... the Cons --The wide \'face\' on this razor kept it from delivering a close shave even though there were 5 blades.  When I used it on my legs I found that it didn\'t get REALLY close, although it was very maneuverable.  When my husband tried it, he found the same thing, plus the wide head meant that it really couldn\'t be easily used as a man\'s razor because there were places it just wouldn\'t go-- like under the nose.Still... the Pros --Where this razor absolutely excelled was the \'nick\' test.  I found that no matter how fast I shaved my legs I never came close to cutting myself, even around the knee.  In fact, I am so impressed with this razor that I called my sister to recommend that she get it for my nieces who are just getting to the age where they will soon be shaving.I think this is an ideal razor for shaving newbies.Pam T~",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So it came as some surprise that this latest generation really did up the ante a bit from a performance standpoint.  Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven\'t so much as gotten a nick.  I\'ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  While I haven\'t attempted to use the razor without shaving cream, as the claims say you can (I have dry/sensitive skin that I feared would not react well), I will say that I think the skin of my legs gets less dry with this razor and I almost didn\'t need body lotion afterward.The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  The razor comes with a case that I believe is intended to adhere to the wall of your shower, with storage for razor blades, which come individually packaged.  I don\'t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can\'t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.The only downside - and one that isn\'t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.  If only you could use the blade to shave the price!  That said, this product is so good that if you\'re trying to select between comparably priced razors/blades from competitors, I strongly recommend you try this one - I think you\'ll be pleased in every way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	5	""October 12, 2009",A3OYO3Z2CHIHFS,Pinnacle of Manual Shaving,What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It\'s now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it\'s thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can\'t be improved.  It\'s just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option. So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested. The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power. That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you\'ve ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your  shaver), you\'ll come to appreciate that gillette\'s blades can last a very long time. The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful. I\'d like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can\'t without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution. That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.Gillette probably hates customers like me. I use a cartridge for up to 6 months without replacement. Partly because I don\'t shave everyday (when you have a beard, skip a day and it\'s not really obvious). I\'m still on the first cartridge so I can\'t tell how dull it\'s become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it\'s 4 months now). Maybe I\'ll update this review when I change my first cartridge. :)Update: I\'ve changed cartridge/blades but only because the old blades look worn, but with the power on, it shaves as well as the new blade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

309,318,20100604,B00024C160,5,"June 4, 2010",A2E5TK6IVZ9PY7,Awesome,I have gone through all the reviews before buying it and I was reluctant as it has higher percentage of bad reviews. I gave it a go based on latest reviews (thanks to all latest reviewers).And the price was too good to be true. I got them for $9.75 only with free shipping (of course I bought one more item to make the total to $25). Price was $13.75 and there was $4.00 discount coupon available at Amazon.These razors are regular Gillette replacement razors and not some low grade version if you buy it from Amazon directly. I am not sure about other sellers at Amazon Marketplace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve never left home feeling that I got a raw deal on these things. I\'ve used them for some pretty important events in my life, most notably and most recently, my wedding. No one\'s ever approached me and said, \'Hey -- learn how to shave!\' and that means something. So as you can imagine, I\'ve been using these things ever since. It feels good to walk into a room and know that anyone who may be scrutizing your face won\'t see any \'pesky whiskers\'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

43,46,20100619,B000052YHS,5,"June 19, 2010",A25UZ7MA72SMKM,Best I\'ve ever used,"With previous razors, it was not uncommon for me to suffer minor cuts while shaving. I have never once had a cut with this razor.Evidently the battery vibration system in concert with the three bladed razors works well. I also get the smoothest shave I\'ve ever been used to. Tip: Run the blade with the whiskers, then make another pass lightly \'against the grain\'. You\'ll wind up with completely smooth skin, no razor burn, and no cuts.The blades are pricey, but in my experience last longer than the blades I\'d used for decades before. When you beging to feel any pulling at all, they are ready to change. Under normal circumstances you won\'t feel this shave against your whiskers at all. You can use the blades for a while after you start to feel a pull ... it still does the job and will just feel like your old razor did.This razor and these blades give me the most comfortable shave above the lip that I\'ve ever experienced. I have a pretty bristly bit of whiskers there, and have experienced lifelong pain shaving that area. I do get a pull feel there even with this razor with new blades, but no pain, and a relatively easy pass to shave there. I do not use the \'against the grain\' tip there tho, LOL, just a second pass with the grain but with a bit of extra pressure to get it close.I\'ve used this razor for a few years now and am delighted. I haven\'t tried the newer Fusion, but feel no need to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gives an excellent and as close a shave as possible but not easy on skin; left it chronically slightly rough. The 3 blade Mach 3 was as good but couldn\'t shave under nose closely. The Fusion solved both problems. Shaves as close as the Sensor and has the single edge to shave under nose. And it is very easy on skin of face. The Fusion lasts a month shaving once a day; I\'ve timed several blades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought this was it , but no, the fusion is bulky compared to the Mach 3 the razor on the back is not very sharp/strong and hard to clean it is smoother when u shave but thats about the only difference no closer than the mach 3 i still have to go against the grain to get a smooth close shave . I understand that not everyones face is the same but i have been unable to find a razor that will give me a close shave without going against the grain not even th 5 blade fusion. Cotaray to popular belief the closest and most comfortable shave i have been able to get is from an electric razor the Braun Actviator.So there u have it other than the new fancy look theres really not much difference or advantage over the Mach 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, I was pleased with the Venus razor. It left my skin feeling smooth and it was easier to use because you cut out the step of having to lather up some shaving cream.Using it for the first time I shaved my legs quite faster then I would doing it the old-fashioned way. You do have to go over areas more than once, especially in using the razor for the first time because I noticed that it kind of grazed the area (probably because the bars are quite high compared to the razor part. I tried it also under my arms but it didn\'t get that area that well and I had to go over it again with a regular razor. So it\'s good to use on your legs but not under your arms.Overall, I\'m pretty pleased with the Venus razor.

And that makes all the difference.,"I have tried so many razors in my year of shaving, and I think I have found the right one. When I first started shaving, about a year ago ( I\'m kinda new to this), I used my moms pink plastic cheapo gillettes that come in packs of like ten. These sucked! Everytime I shaved I would get a new Nick or cut. They didn\'t get all the hair, having only two blades, and irritated my skin. Next, my stepmom bought a pack of cvs brand rip offs of the bic soleil. I thought I was in heaven. These didn\'t Nick quite as much, and had a grippier handle, so there were no slips. I honestly liked this razor, at least compared to those two bladed ones. Then my sister decided to buy herself a Venus spa breeze. I admit to trying it once of twice. This was an even better shave than the cvs ones. The only problem I had where those big shave gel bars. They were slimy and left residue on my legs. I still liked the shave though, but didn\'t want to spend money at the time on sething I wasn\'t completly satisfied with, so I went back to the cvs ones. Finally after hearing my friend raving about the Venus embrace, I thought I\'d try it out. It wasn\'t that expensive, and if I didn\'t like it, I just wodn\'t buy refills. So I bought it. I was in love.The 5 blades cut a little bit closer than the cvs brand \' soleil\'. I didn\'t miss any hairs, even though I only took one pass on each section. I even got a close shave on my knees, thanks to the pivoting head. I also found that my shave took a lot les time. I was done in about half the time it usually took me. I didn\'t even get any cuts.The ribbon of moisture works great. My legs are less irritated than before and it really gave a smooth shave.The soft grip handle was a comfortable fit in my palm. I wouldn\'t say it was grippier than the cvs, but it was certainly a step up from the gillettes.The only thingni felt was not nesasary was the shower pod. Idont keep my razor in the shower anyways, because my younger sis has a tendancy to steal and use my razor. With a razor like this I knew she would want to try it out. The razor is tucked away safely in my room, with the pod in my junk drawer.I give this razor five stars. I am definitly buying the refills.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The included 5-blade razor is quick and sharp by itself, but when you couple it with the vibrating powered trimmer handle, you actually do get an even closer shave, even though it took me a few shaves to get used to the feeling.  The back of the 5-blade razor has a \'precision edging blade\' that lets you precisely shape and edge your sideburns.  Sometimes, depending upon how much I have let my sideburns grow out, I find it easier to just use the powered trimmer without either the razor or comb attachments and using the trimmer by itself does a great job of shaping my sideburns with crisp clean lines.

The Mach III is the first time I felt like I could shave rather absent-mindedly (it is first thing in the morning, after all) and not endanger my face.The issue is that the Mach III has been surpassed by the so-called \'Mach III Turbo\' product release from Gillette.  The naming of that product is unfortunate - \'Turbo\' sounds like some marketing affectation, when in fact it honestly provides you with a vastly superior shaving experience.  Despite the rather obscene price point of the Turbo, I\'d suggest you skip the \'Mach III\' and move up.  I\'m convinced you can get more shaves out of it and make your money back.  Plus, it\'s just a better shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

The wet shaving methods and products are far superior to other shaving mechanisms, but the time it took to safely use a double edge razor took up 25 minutes of my morning for a three pass shave avoiding major nicks along the way.  Using the Proglide I can confidently shave at a pace that is about 4 times faster without nick concerns.  The floating blades so effectively follow the contours of my skin that I get as close as shave as I ever have before.  The benefit of the power micro-vibrating effect is the blade cuts while it \'floats\' over the skin.  It is a great combination to safely cut against the grain in places where I dared not take my double edge razor.  Total time for a wet shave with three passes was about 10 minutes and this was the first time I\'ve used it.  I would expect it to be about 5-7 minutes next time.In defense of double edges, they still remain the best performance/price ratio of any disposable razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

I still recieved Super Savers too because it dropped from even more after I placed the order. Which if you are not aware, Amazon will give you a refund if the price drops within 30 days of when your order shipped.Now as far as the razors go, you simply cannot beat the quality and bang for the buck of Mach3 Turbo. These razors easily last 10 shaves at least for me and cuts in very few strokes as you all should well know by now.I recieved a Gillete Fusion online months ago and tried it and I can say safely that it has no major advantage over the Mach3 line. Are you interested in the sideburn trimmer? If so, than maybe Fusion is for you. If not 5 blades are not better than 3. Beware though you will have to pay at least double the price for half the cartridges.Stick with the Mach3 Turbo especially when it is at $10 or less for 8 cartridges.

1816,719,20060326,B000BUW8WM,5,"March 26, 2006",AU9HN0DN9Z9XD,5 blades? Not just a gimmick. I do notice the difference,"I have read some of the reviews here and decided to give one of my own. I have always been a Gillette Razor user since I started to shave over 25 years ago. I have sensitive skin on my face and neck so shaving is a difficult process for me. My job prohibits beards so I need to shave every 2 days. With razors I have used in the past, with a 2 day growth,  my beard wasn\'t long enough to soften the stubble so it\'s like shaving sand paper. This always resulted in razor burns, nicks and cuts. Sometimes I looked like a victim of a masacre. My last razor was the Mach 3 Turbo. Very good razor but still got some nicks and cuts. Then I saw the commercial for the Fusion razor with 5 blades. My first thought was \'gimmick\' It will be just like any other razor, so I was reluctant to buy it. Eventually after seeing the commercials over and over again they stated with 5 blades there is less friction on your face and it will reduce problems, I broke down and bought one- the power version. The first time I used it I had\'nt shaved for a few days so I had pretty thick growth. The razor was incredible. It hugs your face like no other razor I have ever used. Even on the curves. It feels like it\'s sticking to your skin. When I was finished, not one nick or cut, and no burning sensation. It was the closest shave I ever got. My face felt as smooth as silk. The real test would be 2 days later with a minimal beard growth. That\'s where most of my problems occur. So here I was looking in the mirror with shaving cream on my face and the razor in my hand. I turned it on and went to work. To my surprise and delight it performed with flying colors. No nicks, cuts or burns!! At last a razor that lives up to the hype! I am sold and will use it until Gillette comes out with a 10 blade version! hehehe. Please remember, everybody\'s face, skin, and beard texture is different so you may not get the same results as I did. The blades are very expensive but last a little longer than the Mach 3 blades. However for the shave I got, I\'ll pay it. The one thing that takes a little getting used to is the single blade up on top. Great for shaving  under your nose or marking a sideburn line but takes some practice to use it. I cut the bottom of my nose with it the first time but have gotten the hang of it. All I can say is give this razor a try. If you don\'t like it you can always go back to your old one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

121,126,20110906,B00005AUIE,3,"September 6, 2011",A4YG26XYCO726,Not as great as Venus Embrace,"I bought the Venus Embrace razor (the one with 5 blades) and LOVED it. I assumed it was the Venus razors (versus the Schick ones I had been using) that had made the difference, but the real difference turned out to be the number of blades. Going from a 5-blade razor to a 3-blade razor sucked! Though these ones are much, much less expensive, I find myself having to almost shave twice, going over spots the razor missed. Even after my shower I found spots the razor missed. I never had to worry about that with the Embrace.Also, I feel like the blades dull quicker. With the Embrace, I only had to change the blade about every month or so (shaving about 2-3x week) but this cartridge dulls much quicker than that.However, it is nice that any Venus blade fits all styles of razor handles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1828,731,20060222,B000BUW8WM,3,"February 22, 2006",A243PHL8H4Q25,Gillette Fusion The Best Way a Company can Get you to shell out $45!,"I was skeptical about this product from the moment I saw it. I purchased a M3 Power razor about a year ago and had little complaint with it, the biggest complaint I had was that the button on the handle was in a bad position, mainly the space that I like to grip the handle.Unfortunately, it seems, the new generation of Gillette suffers from even more problems than the previous generation. The button is still in that same godforsaken place. On top of that, the downstroke, or rather, the stroke with the grain is almost completely worthless. I will admit, it didn\'t grab the stubble or tear at my face, and it was a smooth stroke, exactly like the previous generation, but it left a horrendous amount of stubble. The cause of this I believe to be the huge blue buffer pad on the bottom edge of the blade. Even the new blade on the back end of the razor is practically useless. It cuts even worse than the ones on the front.The only positive thing I can say about this is the redesign of the handle. Unlike the M3 Power, you can use your index finger up higher on the handle if you so choose to but your continuously pressing against it and bumping the button.My conclusion would have to be that this is a subpar razor for a radically outragous price. $14 for the Razor, $14 for 4 replacements, and $30+ after tax for 8 replacements. It seems like Gillette was more concerned about getting as much money out of your pockets as they could than they were about designing a better razor. I will be returning to using the M3 Power, if only to save myself time whilst shaving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difference is that it works overnight and lasts far longer. Be ready to change the habits of a lifetime and apply before going to bed, and not worry about showering it away the next day.The packaging makes it easy to apply the right amount of product (three clicks), and you have to make sure it is properly rubbed in.

5822,2127,20100524,B003987CL0,3,"May 24, 2010",A2KHG3JOFXQ4CE,Great Shave But It WILL Cost You,"I had used the predecessor of this model for a few years right up until I retired 18 months ago. When working, even though I made enough money then to buy the EXPENSIVE replacement cartridges, it always left me complaining about the price of such a wonderful shaving experience. Now that I am retired, I had switched to the old fashioned safety razor and began buying assortment packs of different manufactures blades till I found what works best for ME. Turned out, the very cheapest of the dozen brands, works best for me so I have been much happier shaving the old fashioned CHEAP way.  Enter this new version of my old friend....I had to try it since the one biggest downside for me with a so called safety razor is cutting myself. Since a recent heart attack and the blood thinner medication I now have to take, cuts are becoming a real problem. And this razor is SO much safer as well as more comfortable, I had to try it when offered on the Vine Program. Feels the same, looks a little better (to me anyway) than my old unit. Now, this \'soothing micro-pulses for incredible comfort\'? OK, if you say so....Myself, it is simply a major distraction! I can\'t feel what is going on since the vibration is just a MAJOR distraction to the shaving for me. I simply have stopped using this \'feature\'. Every beard is different, every shaver has their own preference. What one loves, another hates etc. Needs are different, results are different. I kind of found all the razor & blade reviews to be sort of useless for me since there are simply too many variables involved in this activity?  But there is one place this series of razor really excels. COMFORT! Vibrate or not, I would really have to want to cut myself, and want to badly to do so. It is buttery smooth for my face. That simply OUTRAGOUS price for new blade refills is somewhat offset by the fact this 5 blade model lasts a bit longer than my single blade safety razor blades. But it still costs so much more, that this return to this razor will end for me, once these blades are done. It is safe, comfortable, and such a close shave, I hate to leave. But retirement pay is just 1/5th of my old working paycheck and this is right at the top of the list for things to cut (bad pun...). Another thing I love about this razor is when I get up in the morning to shave, I have probably only 1/3-1/4th the beard to shave as compared to the next morning if I had used my trusty safety razor.  Bottom line? IF you can afford it and don\'t mind allocating this much money for new blade cartridges, enjoy! It is an amazing tool. I just won\'t spend the money anymore. And another thing, maybe it\'s just me? I see, nor feel, ANY difference in the closeness of the shave either using the vibration feature or NOT using it. When I use it, I really have trouble knowing how well it is cutting. I mean, I have NO sense of if it is cutting or not? Off, it is simply a wonderful razor, but one last time...IF you are willing to pay the high price. Wish I made more money!_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5/28/2010 Update:  OK, I have found another problem with this razor that applies to \'me\' but probably not to the general shaving public? I have several deep scars/crevice wounds to my face from my motorcycle & jet ski racing days (crashes...) This razor simply can NOT get into those areas where a single blade safety razor has NO problem. So if you don\'t have a perfectly smooth (scar free )face, it may not work well for you? I also did some math on replacement blades. Figure around $3.50-$4.00 per refill on this razor. On my safety razor, my blades cost me just 15 CENTS! That 15 CENTS, shaves me perfectly for 7 days. After that, the shave degrades till at 10 days, I no longer have comfort using it. So maybe this can be a guide to the insane cost of using this razor. Bug again, it is such a subjective thing. To someone who has a decent job, they may consider this cost trivial? Or, not even have realized just how out of line it is with alternatives out there. For me, back to the future with a good old safety razor works best. Now I remember why....Take a look at: SHARP STAINLESS Double Edge Polymer Coated Safety Razor Blades for instance. Then look at all the choices for blades in the good old fashioned safety razor. I would give this:- 4 stars for closeness on a smooth face-- 3 stars on a face with scars-- 1 star for cost-  Over all, I let my 4 stars stand since (again),shaving is a very personal & yet subjective thing. One razor doesn\'t fit all.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5/31/2010 Update:Well this will get me some hate mail but I have to downgrade my review from 4 stars to just 3 stars. Reason? I used to get up to 3 weeks of close shaves on the OLD style (see my pictures). This new one with new & \'improved\' thinner blades? Just 7 days and it is cutting me like crazy. But remember, I have to take blood thinner since a recent heart attack. More to the point, I have to ask myself, was this redesign just a way to make sure that the great (but expensive) shave of the old model, would be even better (but ONLY for the manufacturer?) if they discovered a way to get the old design blades not to last so darn long? If so, they REALLY succeeded! This blade is just used up for me after just 7 days. Now my old fashioned safety razor only costs about 15 CENTS. This one? How about $4.25 each???? Sorry, but that is just INSANE!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

493,503,20110703,B000BUUVTE,4,"July 3, 2011",A1IIUCG9TJFUWS,Wish I\'d Bought One Sooner:,"When I first heard that somebody was actually selling a 5-blade VIBRATING razor, I thought I\'d never EVER try it. It sounded like a perfectly good way to turn my face into a pepperoni pizza with extra EVERYTHING on it. The truth, however, is that this is a FANTASTIC product, and I now wish that I\'d bought one MUCH sooner.Random thoughts (since so much has already been said in the Amazon reviews here):1. I HATE shaving. I just frigging HATE it. I can never quite seem to get it just right, and I generally do end-up looking like something straight out of a Stephen King novel when I\'m done. THIS razor has actually changed that for me; I have yet to cut myself with this thing -- believe me when I tell you that (for me) that is really saying something -- and I honestly think that you\'d have to TRY to draw blood with this thing in order to do so.2. Thirty (plus) Dollars for a dozen replacement blades is absurd. (I do pay it, though. Because the shave IS that good.)3. The originally installed blade (usually) in products like these is a high-quality (pharmaceutical grade) titanium (this is true for almost everything sold in this retail space, by the way), and is designed to give you a fantastic first impression -- which it does. The originally installed (set of) blade(s) is an incredibly sharp, long-lasting set -- a finely-tuned, well-engineered piece of highly-toleranced machining that is designed to keep you coming back for more -- which means: buying replacement blades, and a LOT of them. That first, originally-installed set of blades is created to IMPRESS, and the real test of a concept (such as vibrating blades) really needs to be taken past the first usage, and deep into the experience of using replacement blades. I\'ve been using this for about a year, now... and the product continues to impress.4. Replacement blades, of course, are quite different than the originally installed blade -- but there is a simple method to make your replacement blades last much longer than they do, and it\'s this: spray some shower cleaner on the blades, and hang the razor upside down, so any moisture can drain away. The alcohol within the shower cleaner will pull the water away from the blades, and will keep it away. This will prevent the conditions that create rust on the actual blade(s) -- and without that chance to rust, your blades will last for weeks EACH.5. Shaving with a vibrating razor takes a bit of getting used to: you don\'t \'pull,\' but instead, you sort of let it \'drift.\' That\'s not exactly correct, but it\'s close enough. All you really need to do is to exert enough pressure to indicate the general direction of the stroke, and let the razor DRIFT at its own speed. You don\'t \'pull,\' and you don\'t force it. You let it drift.6. Use a good shaving gel, set-up a fogless mirror in the shower, and this thing will give you some incredibly close shaves as you stand under hot water. Take care of your blades with a bit of alcohol-based shower cleaner, hang the unit upside down so water can drain away, and this actually is a worthy investment -- even if they do charge $30 for a set of replacement blades.4 stars.Thirty Dollars for 12 replacement blades is NUTS.That\'s not even debatable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

477,487,20060211,B000BUUVTE,4,"February 11, 2006",A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,"Good technology, but consider the pros and cons","I do love the spot-on reviewer comment below about the Gillette BladeMask.  Whenever these shaving companies come out with these number-of-blade toppers, the inevitable question asked is \'where will it end?\'  I think the BladeMask comment answers that question in a facetious but, hey who knows, perhaps accurate way.  Touch&eacute;.I\'ve always been a (very) early adopter of Gillette blade innovations, so I bought the Fusion first day of release.  [ Hey, A.G. Lafley bought the whole freakin\' company after testing a Fusion prototype, so that\'s a pretty good testament.]In terms of the Fusion itself, there are pros and cons vs. upgrading from the Mach Turbo 3.The pros:- Does seem to be a better shave (certainly takes less strokes, that\'s for sure).  Gillette has succeeded in raising the bar again.- I suspect you\'ll get less wear on each blade meaning you\'ll be able to keep the blade in the razor longer.  [A key point when you  read my \'cons\'.]- The industrial design of the razor, the blade and how the two pieces fit together is a thing of beauty.  A real indication of the increasing pervasiveness of CAD in every aspect of our lives and the need to compete on functionality, price AND design.  [Thank you, Steve Jobs.]- The blade on the back is a real breakthrough.  Sounds bizarre in concept, but great in practice.  You\'ll keep your sideburns straighter and not bang up that space under your nose trying to cram 3+ blades under there.The cons:- Well, of course you need that backside razor because the darn surface face of the blade contraption is so big (this is the \'Big Bertha\' of razors) and spongy-flexible like a teenage gymnast that you can\'t get the shaving impact area within a country mile of the undersize of your nose.  The backside razor isn\'t just a coolness factor; it was birthed out of necessity.- Gillette has now taken its famed \'give way the razor to get the blade revenue\' business model (and the mother of all business analogies) to a price-gouging extreme.  $25 for eight blades? (and that\'s the discount).  What will happen is that shaver across the world will look for a way to extend the life of each blade.  Gillette famously doesn\'t recommend when to change blades  leaving the decision to each shaver (and, hey - Richard Nixon and I had different shaving needs, so how could they possibly recommend a standard).  But - my reaction will be to double the tenure of each blade I put in play.  I think others will consider the same practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it may not be for all skin types.  The gel bars built into the cartridge should give most women an ultra convenient all-in-one shaving experience, but my skin ended up with very mild razor burn.  I started out as the package suggested, in the shower and wetting the razor, then when that burned as I stroked, I made sure that my legs were wet too.  Even that wasn\'t enough; hours later I can feel where each swathe of the razor went. I can also feel how nice and smooth my legs are. It gives a close shave. It\'s a lovely razor; I just need more lubricant.Four stars - it should work well for most users.  But beware if you have dry skin or like me have that thin, no-tan skin; you may need to add a little shaving cream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

485,495,20060131,B000BUUVTE,5,"January 31, 2006",A3OGHSN9Q0849A,Smooth,"Just got this yesterday and so far am very impressed. First off, great design from the shape of the handle etc to the holder itself. If you like cool industrial design for the masses (think Michael Graves and so on at Target) then this will make you happy. It\'s also an impressive piece of manufacturing, that they can get the five blades lined up with such accuracy. Extra points for the design geeks.More importantly of course, the shaving experience itself. I live in Minnesota which right now (winter) has quite a dry climate, so a harsh shave will leave you with raw, uncomfortable skin for most of the day. I\'m not sure if this razor gave a closer shave than with my Mach 3, but it certainly was way quicker and required fewer re-strokes, which cuts down on irritation and the potential for nicks and cuts. It was easy to shave the hard-to-manage parts of my face where the hairs aren\'t all lying in the same direction, like under my jaw, which again cut down on the number of re-strokes. Once I got used to the extra razor on the back of the cartridge, I liked the way I could use it as advertised: for near my nose, round my goatee etc.I have to admit that I thought five blades sounded ridiculous, but it does seem to work just as stated in the manufacturer\'s blurb.UPDATE: Now had this for about two weeks, and I\'m continuing to be happy with it. I\'ve noticed a lot fewer problems with ingrown hairs and little nicks and cuts. The cartridges seem to last a good long time too - I haven\'t had to change the first one yet and it still does a good job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2176,1085,20080414,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 14, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,Great Razor,"I have thick hair which grows in rather quickly. I have tried probably most hair removal products on the market. This includes a huge number of razor types, hair removal gels, buffers, sanders, yankers, radio signal needles, and much more.I admit that when the first more-than-two razor blades came out, that my boyfriend and I thought of them as a silly gimmick. The only reason we tried one is that a friend of ours worked at Gillette and I wanted to give her some feedback on how they worked. We thought it would be a wash. We were quite surprised that it did actually provide a better shave.In a way, it makes sense. The whole reason to have multiple blades is that hair is not all orderly and in a line. The first blade might cut off some of the hairs, but some will just bend beneath it. That bending then creates tension for the second blade to be able to cut it.If you only needed two blades, then you could do a single pass with a two bladed razor and have it completely clear all hair in its path. Of course, that doesn\'t work - at least not for me! When I then tested out a three blade razor, it definitely cut more hair on the first pass. Also, because you now have more \'cutting power\', you don\'t need to press as hard.So does this logic move on to give blades? Again, I was a little skeptical. First, the ergonomics of this razor are just GREAT. I\'ve tried many, many types of razors over the years. They can be very slippery in the shower. This one has a super combination of shape and texture. It fits nicely in the hand, and stays there securely.I also really like the wall attachment that this tucks into. The attachment holds spare blades as well. It stays securely on our shower wall and is easy to put the razor in and out of.So how well does it work? I\'ve tried it with a variety of soaps and gels. It slides smoothly and with the five blades it cuts thick hair with just one draw, without much effort. The without much effort part is really key. It means you get far less cuts, because you are not pressing down into skin bumps or goosebumps. You don\'t get razor burn because the blades are not dragging hard along your skin, slicing off the top layer.I haven\'t had any problems using it on any part of me. Underarms, legs, ankles, you name it. I would most definitely rather have the five blades with its gentle cutting power vs a smaller version. Heck, smaller razors with two blades *do* exist. There\'s a reason I use this one instead. It simply works better.Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,58,20040601,B000052YHS,5,"June 1, 2004",A1H87D90UI05DQ,Best I have used,"I grew up with cheap plastic disposable razors.  A couple of years ago I tried the Mach 3 and I haven\'t turned back.  Oh, I have tried a few other products, just to see if something was better.  The Schick Quattro my wife gave me (after getting a coupon for a free one) found itself at the city landfill after 7 days.  I have a full, thick beard and fairly sensitive skin.  This blade cleans my face perfectly and I find it extremely rare to suffer a nick or cut on my face.  The handle is perfectly designed and bends to the contour of my face.  The blades pop in and out easily.  One drawback is that the blades are just a bit pricy.  But, the blades also last as long as three of the disposable blades I used to use.  The moisturizing strip could last a little longer, but it isn\'t a major factor for me.I gave this product a 5 because it is the best razor I have found.  I will keep trying to use new razors to see if someone can beat it, but, until then, I am staying with the Mach 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

I\'ve experimented with this razor for the past few days.  I will not be permanently upgrading to this.  For some reason, Gillette appears to have completely bought into the notion that five blades gives a better shave than just two or three.  Like the Fusion Power, the Fusion Proglide Power has some of the same problems.  The most obvious problem it has is cost (just like the Fusion Power).  For the quality of the shave you get, the cost of replacement cartridges is not justified.  To be fair, I have noticed a slightly more comfortable glide with this over the Fusion Power.  The blade stabilizer and microcombs do appear to be a modest improvement in this regard.  Also, the Fusion Proglide blades appear to last a little longer than the Fusion Power blades - but not by much.  The micropulses still do not provide a greater degree of comfort over a razor that lacks this feature.  Also, I have not noticed a closer shave with this razor over the current one I am using (which is now the Schick Hydro 3).  When comparing it my current razor, the Fusion Proglide Power definitely lacks the level of smoothness and comfort.  Last but not least, just like its predecessor, I\'ve discovered this five bladed razor tends to nick my face more often than a double or triple bladed razor.  Gillette needs to get back to basics by realizing it is much easier to keep a satisfied customer who gets a good, comfortable shave as opposed to introducing new brands of razors that have gimmicks, and that are, not to mention, ridiculously overpriced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

These turbo blades combined with a good shaving gel last me around 2-3 months before I HAVE to replace it. Now after a couple of weeks they don\'t shave as effortlessly as fresh out of the box but I am a frugal person and don\'t like to waste money. The important thing to me is that if I shave in the morning I don\'t want a shadow in the evening. These blades do that. I often go the weekend without shaving so on Monday the blade has alot of work to do and after 2-3 months it can still handle it. With this schedule this shaving system isn\'t expensive at all-less than $1/month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

2430,1346,20110803,B001F51QJ8,5,"August 3, 2011",A265PG217IMFSS,Strong but Easy on the Pits,"I have had trouble recently with reaction to several brands of anti-perspirant.  I bought this Gillete solid a couple of months ago in the hopes of getting some relief.  I am an active guy and work out 5 or more times per week.  I also work long hours at a desk and need something that can keep me halfway fresh with these activities.  I have found that this product works very well.  It is strong, so strong in fact that I can use it every other day at times depending on my activity level.  It does not give you that uncomfortable dry and impossible to wash feeling under the arms.  At the same time, it keeps me dry.  It does not have a strong scent at all so look elsewhere or add an aftershave if you are looking to smell good.  Most importantly for me, I have not reacted at all to this product.  Summary - it has worked very well for me and I recommend it to you.  Cheers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2283,1194,20090712,B000XVTYYY,5,"July 12, 2009",A3RY293E1A4JCW,Different quality grade?,"It just slays me how expensive these shaving cartridges are, but I must admit they do shave better than old twin-blade systems.  [...].  I\'ve never used Turbo and I\'m not sure what it would add to my shaving successes, so I figured I didn\'t want to pay more for this feature.Amazon had the best price I could find on the regular Mach3, but when I received them I must say they look different than I remember.  They seem to be made of cheap black plastic, I could swear the ones I bought in retail stores felt better made.  I dropped my razor in the shower recently and the metal tabs that hold the whole thing together bent and tweaked the cartridge -- this had never happened in years of dropping store-bought Mach3s.  And it might be my imagination but it seems like I am needing to change blades more frequently, as if the blade is a poorer grade metal that dulls or corrodes faster.I can\'t prove it but I suspect Gillette is trying to phase out this product to steer consumers to a more expensive update, and is manufacturing a cheaper version for guys like me who cling to this product in hopes of avoiding the more expensive update, but the spotty quality will probably push me there eventually anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5877,2183,20101114,B003987CL0,5,"November 14, 2010",A1BVDUVRIX24VT,The best shave this side of a barber shop,"When I was younger, I used electric razors, Norelco and Braun types, and thought they were fine; I was a bit intimidated by manual shaving. Then when I got a older I disliked the fact I could never shave very close with those razors, leading to afternoon beard shadows. Plus, it was hard to do anything like trim a smart goatee or sideburns, not to mention the heads would wear out periodically, and were expensive to replace.Finally I moved to shaving cream and manual razors, and it was like graduating to the big leagues, or moving from an automatic transmission to a stick-shift. I felt more in control and got a much better shave that lasted all day. But with cheap razors I found I\'d end up with nicks and irritations no matter how carefully I shaved. I\'m the type of shaver who goes against the grain; otherwise, I\'d never get close enough (my beard grows pretty fast).I\'ve tried most of the hyped-up Gillette and Schick razors over the years, and while they were a definite improvement over the throwaway kind, they were never all they were cracked up to be - I just figured razor technology had gone about as far as it could go, and adding more blades or a gimmick like battery power were just oneupmanship between the two major brands to win market share.That is, until I decided to give this Fusion Proglide Power a shot. I should say right up front, I\'ve not used the non-power version, so I can\'t comment on whether the vibration is a gimmick or does something useful. But I will say I haven\'t had a better shave except from a barber! The basic razor (and especially the starter kit) are not expensive, for what they are. The \'hidden\' cost, of course, is the price of the blades (and the Fusion creams if you choose to use their brand). This could be a big drawback for some, but I value the comfortable, nick-free shave this razor gives me and the extra cost is worth it.In my experience, the only better shave you can get is from a straight razor or good safety razor with the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush. But that makes a mess and is hard to master. I was actually going to try that route before I bought the Proglide... now, I don\'t have to! This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well. I\'m used to having to dip my razor in the water, tap it hard on the back, or some other way to unclog the blades after every few strokes. Not so with this one. Maybe because the blades are thinner? I don\'t know, but it just seems like it never clogs, even with some heavy growth to mow. That\'s another big plus in my book.I dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \'system\' of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave. I think those products are overpriced and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well. But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars. Do I wish the blades were cheaper? Sure. But I don\'t mind paying for something when it\'s actually worth the extra money, and to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money. Good job this time around, Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5860,2166,20110406,B003987CL0,5,"April 6, 2011",A2WGEMRP15AYQV,The best shave ever!,"I will admit that when I decided to buy this razor, I did so with much skepticism, having been disappointed by the shave of the Gillette Fusion Power Razor.I finally decided to pull the trigger on the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, and  by the time it was delivered, I already had a 3 day growth of facial stubble. I lathered up and was amazed as the razor glided effortlessly over my face and through the stubble, giving the smoothest, most comfortable shave that I have had. Not a bit of drag or irritation was experienced, so I let my beard grow for a week, thinking that this time it would fail the standard it now set. To my amazement, the shave was still superb with no irritation. I finally tested it by shaving daily with the same results.Concerning the lubricating strip, it is a definite improvement, being more slick and lasting longer while the handle allows a more secure and comfortable grip than its predecessor. I\'m still on my first blade after 4 weeks and the shave is still very comfortable. The single blade at the back of the blade head does a great job especially above the top and lower lip, and the soft blue glow of the power button does add a cool touch. Shaving was done with the power feature on and off, but either way the shave is excellent.Overall, Gillette definitely has a winner here with the Proglide Power Razor. I\'d definitely recommend it, so give it a try and I\'m sure you won\'t be disappointed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5755,2057,20100717,B003987CL0,4,"July 17, 2010",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,Great but Expensive,"First I\'ll note that I\'m a female, and not the target audience for this item, so I handed it over to my boyfriend to do the testing. He\'s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.His current razor is a Mach 3, so he did side by side comparisons between that one and this Fusion Proglide. He did the typical half-the-face test where he shaved each half with one of the razors. He did comparison tests where he tried it powered and non-powered.For all of these tests, the result - the shave closeness - was about the same. This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.As for the *process* of shaving. running the Fusion Proglide with the power off felt similar to using the Mach 3. However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \'pull\' - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  I\'ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.He was expecting the trimmer blade to be pretty useless - but it turns out it was pretty convenient for trimming. You can\'t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.He used it for a half dozen shaves, and the blade still has a little life left, which is on par with a Mach 3.For people who already have a Mach 3 and didn\'t care about the \'shaving process itself\', there\'s no real reason to change blades. People who are having issues with tugging and pulling might appreciate the smoother shaving experience with the Proglide.On the issue of blade cost, if you buy the Proglide blades in bulk, you can get blades closer to $3 a blade. Still, this can seem expensive compared with other options.In the end we\'re hoping when we run out of Mach 3 blades that the blades for this one might have dropped in price and we\'ll move over to the Proglide. However, but it\'s not like we\'d toss out the Mach 3 and the existing blades in order to use this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, the replacement cartridges are very high-priced BUT you\'ll get an ultra-smooth and very clean shave every time--and your skin will thank you. The idea of a 5-blade razor may seem extreme to some but it really does work well and (with proper preparation) will give you the smoothest shave possible. For me, the best thing about the Gillette Fusion system is I can shave (both my head and face) with virtually NO irritation, redness or razor bumps AND get it done very quickly (at least in comparison to single or twin-blade razors). Case in point: I used to literally tear up my neck (especially around my Adam\'s apple area) years ago when shaving with single or 2-blade razors but with the Fusion I get a nick-free shave almost every time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4316,1699,20120315,B001JQLNH8,5,"March 15, 2012",A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,They work the same as Mach3 cartridges,"The Mach3 was introduced by Gillette in 1998 and I\'ve used them since then when I haven\'t had a beard or used an electric. I\'ve tried alternative blades, including old-fashioned double edge blades, and although I resist buying and using the Mach3 because IMO the cartridges are way overpriced (one source says the cartridges cost 9 cents to produce, yet they typically retail for around $2.30 per cartridge), I always return to the Mach3 because it gives me the cleanest, most consistently bloodless shave.I\'m looking now at the Mach3 I bought back when they were introduced side by side with a Mach3 disposable, and if there is any difference between the actual shaving heads, I cannot detect it. I don\'t know if handles that hold Mach3 cartridges are made the same as they were when I bought mine, but my old one has some metal on it and is heavier than the disposable, which is all plastic and rubber. The handle of the disposable is fatter than that on my old Mach3, making for a somewhat more comfortable grip.I bought this 6-pack of disposables because with Amazon\'s present special offer (a $2 e-coupon that is applied at checkout) the price per unit is only around $1.80 each (compared, as I say above, to an average price of around $2.30 per cartridge). When I use these up I\'ll look for the best price I can find on Mach3 cartridges or disposables and will purchase whichever is cheapest.These disposables have clear covers over the blades, which slide off and can easily be slid back on, making them especially handy for travel.A few years ago, after shaving for around four decades with various shaving foams, I discovered Aveeno shave gel and have used it ever since. A little bit goes a very long way so I don\'t worry about the price, and I find the Aveeno gel/Mach3 blade combination perfect for my face and fairly dense and tough beard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

The shape was easy to hold (unlike some other high-end women\'s razors I\'ve purchased in the past that had hard shapes to hold).The package I received came with what Gilette is calling a \'shower pod\' which is a holder for the razor and some refill cartridges that has suction cups that you can stick to your shower wall. It is convenient to hang it on the shower wall. It stuck to the smooth surface of my ceramic tile well.The refill cartridges come in sealed plastic packages so they can be stored in the shower, inside the shower pod, without rusting or getting the aloe vera strip worn down from water.To sum it up, it gave a great shave, the shower pod was convenient and the sealed refills are very practical.I have no complaints!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

4313,1696,20101220,B001JQLNGY,5,"December 20, 2010",AHO9XJ7BCX8NF,Great razors for the price,"These razors were just what I was looking for. I needed razors for shaving my legs (the lady shavers just don\'t seem to hold up as well as the mens). The three blades are spaced far enough apart that they rinse clean easily, and each one has a protective cover for the blade.  They also have a rubberized handle for a sure grip in soapy water. The price was right for 8 razors, too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
476,486,20060211,B000BUUVTE,5,"February 11, 2006",A1OAN01CO11VIX,Best Razor Design,"I moved from a SensorExcel (2 blades) to this and this one is much better.I had a full face of hair (I hadn\'t shaved in about 4-5 days), enough to start a beard. One slow stroke across each section of skin with this razor was enough to clear out the hair with more precision than the SensorExcel could after 3 or 4 strokes.That is: a *new* SensorExcel blade in the same situation (4-5 days worth of hair) did worse and resulted in at least 3 cuts on average (whereas this blade resulted in no cuts). So clearly the new design helps. It does exactly what the ad says: spreads out the pressure of the cutting edges to reduce (eliminate in my case) the effect of your skin wrapping around the blade and causing cuts.But I believe you must use this blade SLOWLY. If you have the full face of hair like I did, that would be about 2 square inches per stroke, then wash. You can look into the blade and see very easily how full it is because with all those blades stacked so tightly together all the hair stays on the surface.This makes it easy to clean, too. Just run your thumb down the blades and you will easily unclog them. Compare this to the SensorExcel: once hairs were stuck in the abyss, they were usually there for good, requiring frequent blade changes. Hopefully this means the expensive blades will last longer (and thus prove to be worth the expense).This razor *is* an example of improvement via technology. I cannot agree that it is *revolutionary* but it is a good idea and it *is* the best razor design (I\'m comparing to double and triple razor designs, which I have used in the past). So it isn\'t the best on a revolutionary scale but it is the best.This razor\'s product execution was also an example of ridiculous marketing strategies gone over the top and if you want a laugh (or to be offended by the sheer obfuscation of information via distracting animations, interface, and sexual innuendo), I suggest checking out its website. The company could have made a greater profit had they foregone the ridiculously over-interfaced website because I doubt it convinced anyone. My first thought on entering was \'do I have to defeat the first boss before I can see their explanation for why a Power version of my razor is better?\' Along with the handle and cradle design, I would call it one of the most absurd and gaudy product executions I\'ve ever seen.However, the company luckily stumbled upon the best razor design in the process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have also tried the Gilette men\'s sensor excel blades, which are interchangeable with these, and they are identical as far as I can tell (the women\'s blades are slightly cheaper, though).  I can\'t say that I never get razor bumps, but I think that\'s also dependent on the shaving cream.  It helps to have a fresh blade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I tried the Fusion razors and honestly could not believe the difference in the shave that I got.  Even with my other razors, I could still feel some stubble when I ran my hand against the grain after a shave.  I hardly, if ever, feel this with the Fusion razors!  I also noticed a big difference in that the Fusion razors seems to have much less pull when shaving long stubble.  GREAT product.

487,497,20111025,B000BUUVTE,1,"October 25, 2011",A33Z2ISB65925S,Simply terrible,"I gave it a try for pretty much the last year until I ran out of blades that I had pre-purchased.  I\'m done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave.  Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other \'detail\' parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front.  It just doesn\'t work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6397,2708,20111210,B004PF3MZQ,2,"December 10, 2011",A1GOM4DSZY452J,Ouch!,"Ten years ago, a friend suggested I try Venus razors to avoid nicks and cuts.  They have worked wonderfully all that time; the only time I get nicked is sometimes on the first use of a new blade.  The last time I was shopping for blades, the ProSkin ones were on sale, so I thought I\'d try them (the ever-rising price on the Venus blades is their downside).The first time I used it, I wound up with about 6 different cuts, several of them bleeding freely.  I chalked it up to the first time.... Next use I still wound up bleeding (though not as badly).  After that I began to use regular shave-gel with the blade (defeating their whole point), and with that I still get razor burn and abrasions, but no bleeding.These blades defeat the very trait I use Venus razors for, and the earlier reviewer is correct-- the \'moisture bars\' fall off after a couple of weeks (maybe 5 or 6 uses in my case), making them no bargain (I can use the regular blades for a month or more each).The DO shave closely and leave skin smooth, but are not worth the trade-off in discomfort and blood.My advice is skip these and get any of the other blades in the line-- I\'ve tried them all at different times and they all work better than the ProSkin ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This product has a fresh, clean masculine scent.  The scent is mild though.  Not over-powering at all.  So, if you are a man that wears a cologne, this definitely will not mix with it.It doesn\'t flake or clump.  I also noticed that when you put it on your skin it doesn\'t have that sticky or wet feeling.  It goes on smooth and once on, you can\'t even tell you\'re wearing it!The deodorant DOES NOT wipe off on your clothing. Even though the solid is white, it goes on clear. After having this over a week now, several shirts have been worn in differt colors and types.  The colors ranged from dark to light and the types were anything from a button down to a pull-over.  No residue or white marks could be seen on any of the shirts and most importantly, there was no sign of wetness all day!Gillette has always been a name to trust when it comes to shaving and antipersperant products! I would definitely recommend this product to any man looking for a clean, masculine scent that isn\'t over-powering, but will keep you dry all day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also has this little squishy suction cup thing, which is suppose to make the razor holder stick to the bathroom wall. (The squishy cup doesn\'t work.)However, the razor itself is fine. It does give a close shave. I have not noticed any difference between this razor and some of the more expensive ones. Therefore, I would recommend getting this. I use mine daily and have been for several weeks now. It hasn\'t gone bad yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5810,2114,20100530,B003987CL0,4,"May 30, 2010",A1HYZ3MT9YY0PS,"Not perfect, but getting there...","I consider myself an avid wet shaver.  I have all the products - the Merkur\'s safety razors, the Gillette Fatboy, and as assortment of straight razors from Dovo and Thiers Issard.  There is nothing more that I enjoy than lathering up my Rooney silvertip badger and shaving on a weekend morning.  However, for those quick morning shaves before work I always turn to my trusty Gillette, ranging over my shaving career from the Sensor Excel to the Mach III to the Fusion and now the Proglide.  I have to say, each has been an improvement over the previous, with the newest generation being the best.Gillette loves to throw in the marketing gimmicks - the \'enlarged lubrastrip\', the \'redesigned precision trimmer\', the \'micro-combs\', and the \'thinner, finer blades.\'  All of these are just lovely ways of saying - hey, we are not giving you a different colored fusion razor like the phenom or racecar or matrix of whatever they called the other Fusions.What I can say, is that somehow with all these \'innovations\', they have managed to minorly improve an already stellar razor.  It does what it says, it glides better on your face.  It have me a 9/10 shave with one pass with the grain in 1 minute of time with no irritation.  You maybe able to get a 10/10 baby butt smooth shave with a Thiers Issard straight blade with a careful four pass 15 minute shaving, but who has time for that!  And it has less tug, less drag than the fusion.Gillette has always been the King of shaving.  The Fusion has put all other over the counter modern safety razors to shame.  This just follows their precedent.  Yeah, it is a Fusion razor with a blue LED light and some minor changes.  But hey!  It\'s great.  It is an all around great razor.  The Proglide will now be my new go to razor for the prework shave.  I give it four stars because it is a great razor, it\'s the best on the market, but it isn\'t perfection.  Gillette is striving towards it.  I want that 10/10 shave.  That may be too much to ask.  But is Gillette thinks they\'ve gotten it complete figured out, they\'ll stop trying.Good job, Gillette.  You know shaving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

494,504,20110625,B000BUUVTE,3,"June 25, 2011",A2CJR7FWFCM19H,close shave,"The shape of this shaver is the same as all of the other gillettes ergonomically. The blades that are close together keep me from accidentally cutting my face or head. Yep, I shave bald so my razors are very important to me. I, also like the single blade that allows me to sculpt my goatee. The blades do give me a close shave. So if it tugs the hair, you should probably use a  better shaving cream.Now the things I wish were better about the razor:The blades have a lubricating strip on them that works wonderfully at first and,  after one or two shaves, the strip turns white and loses its lubrication. For the price, its not like you\'re going to throw it away after one shave. The other factor is that the price of the replacement blades borders on rediculous. This is supposed to be inexpensive hygiene tool like a toothbrush or under arm deodorant. These blades cost more than both of them combined. Doesn\'t make sense to buy the blades when it is just as expensive to let my barber do it for me. The razor itself is decently priced. I would love this product if blades were cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It did not even come close to giving the smooth, close shave these blades do.

Ever since the original release, the blue ones, I rarely try other brands anymore.  The thing that I find a little unusual about the Moisturerich blades is how close they seem to resemble the Breeze blades which are some of my least favorite blades. The moisture gel feels slimy, and while that might switch to smooth after you rinse it away, it\'s not a lather and not at all pleasant while using it. Like the Breeze, the gel is used up rather quickly unlike the Embrace which lasts awhile.This isn\'t a bad a blade since it still shaves close and doesn\'t feel like you\'re scraping your skin, but the other blades just work better with less fuss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was encouraged knowing that with Amazon this would not of been a problem so I went ahead and ordered (since I knew I could return easily with Amazon).  I got my razors and they work great.  I have used the same razor for 3 weeks now and still do not need to replace the blade.  They do not fall apart like someone else mentioned.  They do not go dull very fast either; I shave at least 5 times a week and still am using the first blade after 3 weeks.  I recommend this to anyone who is trying to get the best deal for blades.  Feel free to ignore the other reviews that say this product is fake or defective... I agree with another reviewer who said that they believed those reviews to be miss leading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve tried electric razors, but anything that\'s cheaper that buying Mach 3 blades can\'t do a thing about shaving the hairs on my neck.  I\'d guess that I use a blade every month and a half (long after the lubricating strip is gone), which makes this cost about $16 / year.  A fine deal if you ask me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gillette should have no problem making these trimmers with replacement heads, not sure why they didn\'t since almost all their products have that feature.

NOT sold by \'So & So\' and \'Fulfilled\' by Amazon - not good. Unfortunately these 3rd party sellers are selling fake blades - the ones everybody\'s complaining about - the same ones you\'ll find all over e-bay.I\'m ashamed to say I\'ve been using the fake (knock-off, counterfeit) blades for a couple of years. I had a hunch that either something was wrong or Gillette wasn\'t consistent with their product. Because some blades were better than others, some just didn\'t feel right from the start, and none of them lasted all that long. So this time around when I went looking to purchase new shaving materials I heard all this talk about phony blades and it all made sense. Those bums definitely made a fool out of me with their slick packaging, because they certainly \'look\' like real authentic Gillette replacement blades but they aren\'t.And now that I\'ve once again shaved my head with a REAL Gillette Mach 3 Turbo blade purchased from a reputable retailer (Amazon) I now realize what I have been missing - a smooth, close, effortless shave which doesn\'t tear me up. And to my surprise the lubricating feature on the Turbo actually works! A great product.One more word of advice - keep your eye on the price of this item as it fluctuates often! Keep it in your shopping cart and buy when the price drops. I paid $1.83 per blade. Great deal.Once again... ships and sold by Amazon... VERY important!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

2027,934,20111205,B000XVSNTQ,5,"December 5, 2011",A3EADWE0F3A1J6,Amazing!,"First I have to commend Venus on there packaging. We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs. I love it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new version lists alcohol as the #2 ingredient! So that cooling affect some claim is the alcohol reacting to your skin. Skin doesn\'t need alcohol. Very dissapointed that Gillette changed around the Fusion line. I did try this new line and it irritated my skin pretty quickly. Not a good product for sensitive skin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s great for people on the go, easy to put in a gym bag etc. It\'s also less stuff cluttering your shower, which I\'m down for. On first use, it works great. Shaves easily, no nicks, close shave. It is a little stringy( seeing little strings of gel from the razor to your skin), but it doesn\'t really make a difference using it, its just a little odd. My legs felt nice afterwards, not parched and dry. But I always follow up with a shea body butter when I get out of the shower anyway, so that\'s never been a big concern of mine.The down side is that the shaving gel bar part is going to be gone long before the razor(maybe after 3-4 uses). I use my Venus cartridges probably longer then most...1: because I\'m not obsessed with the closest shave ever and 2: because I feel guilt pangs whenever I throw something like this in the garbage(trying to be green here!). So eventually I know I\'ll be using this particular razor with my traditional shaving cream despite the fact that it started off easy-peasy. Would I buy it again? Maybe if I saw the cartridges on super sale. But on the whole, I\'m doing just fine with my other venus \'divine\' razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I find it objectable that manufacturers continue to just keep producing razors with more and more blades. We then have the option to get new razor or if lucky we receive a free one in the mail. They make the money on those blades. They now have 5 individual blades per cartridge and the cost about $3.50 each in an 8 pack. I opt for my excellent double blade razor that I have used for 15 years and buy the best double edge blades at about 30 cents each. Then a excellent Neutrogena Shave Creme with SPF15. I get a excellent shave, great skin care and smooth shave at about 75% less cost. I rate this low because of the high cost and wasting your money on a razor that will be change within a year. You wives should spend about $30 on a excellent shaver and good skin care products and stop foolishly wasting money on gimmicks...that take your hard earned money. In this case stay with the time tested product. You can get the items I mention on Amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During that deployment, I managed to use the same blade for 20+ days at a time. Did I mention I also shaved my scalp with the same blade....? Since my return home at the end of 2007, I\'ve been getting a month\'s use per blade on both my face and scalp. I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but, what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long? On the 1st of each month, I replace the old blade with a fresh one. The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months.... You have to admit, that\'s money well spent.I\'ve used all types of blades starting when I was 15...single, double, triple edge blades...Electric shavers, clippers, and even depilatories(which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it, spread it on, wait for it to cure, scrape it off, and wash the excess off my face). I\'ve never had a razor blade that shaved me so close, for so long.To close this review I\'d like to add that I\'ve been on Active Duty in the U.S. Army for 24 years, 7 months & 21 days now and will retire in 41 days (June 30th).  I will continue to shave my face and scalp with the Gillette Fusion but, I doubt I\'ll do it as often. I\'ve earned it.

Also, I go through these blades faster than I ever have with a single or 3-blade system. And lastly, the razor cuts my face. The 5 blades is supposed to make the experience easier but it doesn\'t. I never cut myself with 3-blade systems. Overall, this is a horrible razor and I encourage you to look to others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

508,518,20100714,B000BUUVTE,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was quite surprised that after two weeks using the Proglide that I have to say it does indeed provide a better shave than the previously mentioned model. I\'m not sure it it\'s the thinner blades that seem to offer much less resistance both against the grain as well as with it, or one of the other features. The power version also has a feature that claims to guide the hairs in straighter for a more close, even cut. While I\'m not sure if this is a gimmick or not, the proof seems to be in the proverbial pudding. For me, the shaves have been much better with less irritaion, and so far the blades seem to last longer than the old version. On the older version I could only get three good shaves at the most before feeling it was time to replace them. With the proglide I only have had to change the blades once in two weeks, and the performance has always been fantastic. Of course, these statements are just my \'two cents\' worth, as shaving is very subjective and there are so many factors that go in to a great shave. But for my purposes, this new Proglide seems to fit the bill very nicely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, it goes without saying when I figured I had enough of my face and chin looking like a rocky road I was bound to notice improvements when I picked up this razor, and I did.Quality isn\'t an issue here: the razor looks great, and gives me a very smooth shave. There is also a vibrating function which I choose to use since it eliminates just about any tug I feel on my skin. My shave feels much more comfortable, looks better, and even with 5 blades it works well against my sensitive skin which I already see improving. The precision trimmer edges up nicely for the clean cut look, but after experimenting I also feel it\'s a less risky shave than the main blades around the \'danger zone\' chin and neck area.So now, I got my free razor from Gillette, love it and plan on getting more razors/blades...whats the catch? At almost four bucks a blade for refills, this is simply outrageous and it\'s a dealbreaker for me. I\'ll keep using these until the razors I currently have go dull (luckily that will take a while) and downgrade to the original Gillette Fusion Blades unless the price of refills goes down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

The small, floating head of this razor followed the curves quite easily, and again no cuts or nicks.  The best was yet to come though when no razor bumps appeared later.This product does come with a holder designed to be attached to theshower with suction cups, a nice touch.  Overall the Venus is a bit pricey, especially compared to discount store bags of disposables, but the ease of use and the close shave, without irritation makes the expense worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6518,2834,20120411,B0072K0SP8,4,"April 11, 2012",AKJHHD5VEH7VG,Gigantic cartridge but a good shave.,"I recently received this product to review. Once I got over the shock of the gigantic sized cartridge, I was okay.What comes in the package:  One handle, one cartridge and a suction holder (which didn\'t stay suctioned anywhere in my bathroom).The handle: Is smooshy and has a soft gel-like grip.  I loved this.  It doesn\'t slip around in the shower and fits nicely in my hand.The cartridge: Did I mention this was huge?  I was trying to find a common object to compare it to.  I ended up using money. The cartridge is almost as wide as two quarters.  There is still portions on left uncovered above the quarters. The razor itself has 5 blades-nice.  On either side of the blade is an Olay bar-which is what makes this so huge.  I\'m assuming these will shrink with use.The shave: I was not brave enough to use this without soap on my legs.  I usually just squeeze shower cream into a bath puff and lather my legs. So, I don\'t use a thick lather...just enough to help the razor glide and not give me razor burn.  I did notice that there was an improved smoothness to the shave.  Even with my usual shower cream, there was not a big lather. For me, this is a plus. For others, the lack of shaving cream/gel thickness may take some getting used to.The shave was close. My skin was smooth afterwards.  It even did well under my arms.  Now, if you were to use this anywhere between your underarms and your legs, there may be issues since the cartridge is gigantic. This is a bummer.The cartridge refills run about five dollars each.  A bit pricy but if you are no longer buying shaving cream, the cost evens out.  The plus is that you can use the refills on any Venus handle (per the product description of the replacement cartridges).  However, this handle is better than the Venus handles I\'ve used in the past, but if you have a handle...it\'s nice to know you\'re not being forced to buy a new one. Brownie points for Gillette.The front of the package has a sticker guarantee that states \'Love it or 2x money back\'.  My final thought for this review is: If I would have paid for this product, would I take advantage of the guarantee?  My answer is no.  Although the size of the cartridge is what is keeping me from giving this 5 stars, the bars on the cartridge are superior to the nasty little sticky moisturizing strips on other razors.  The shave was good.  If purchased on sale, it would be an excellent buy.I will update my review to note how long the bars last on the one cartridge that I have (shaving every other day...down from my previous daily OCD shave).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Arctic Ice Gillette Clear Shield deodorant has a decent fragrance, but I can\'t say how well it works since I won\'t try anti-perspirants. The packaging is pretty nice, what you\'d expect from a major company. Who knows, maybe they\'ve discovered chemicals that are non-irritating.

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

When I began shaving however, I KNEW something was majorly wrong.I kept shaving because at the time it did not cross my mind that there could even be fake Mach 3 blades.  I was trying to figure out if my face wasn\'t warm enough, I even had to check to make sure that I had put enough shaving cream on.  I was just baffled as to why the razors were more pulling out my hair and cutting my skin than they were actually shaving the hair.Needless to shave I ended up with a horrible shave job with hair still remaining in small patches, an extremely irritated and cut face, and a realization that I was completely scammed.  Since the packaging looked legit, I had no reason to doubt the product and I\'m not outside of the window to do too much about it.I am worried now that the blades were not even sterile, and I have never in my life had my face burn so bad after a shave.  Do not mess around with things that can cut you, and be aware of the fact that now there are even fake blades on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6213,2522,20120219,B004B8AZH0,4,"February 19, 2012",A2LRNLAV0ZIL4U,Best blades I\'ve used - but they won\'t forgive carelessness,"I shave my head - so a clean, heavy-duty blade is a must. The shave cannot leave spotty stubble, and the blade can\'t dull after 2-3 attempts either.These Fusions are the best blades I\'ve used for the task. I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face. The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.Even with a week\'s growth on the head, the blade is up to it (granted, I\'m pretty bald, so we\'re not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here). It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that\'s needed.The one flaw is not the blade\'s fault - but it\'s still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you\'re using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.I\'ve cut myself quite a few times, usually on the fingers when I\'m switching hands, or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick. It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot. It can be the kind of cut you\'ll actually need to pay attention too.Other blades can cut too, of course, but this razor\'s series of blades will make it quite a bit worse. If it was just my face, I probably wouldn\'t make the mistake, but since I\'m shaving my head I can\'t always see what I\'m doing, and that can be the problem. I\'ve never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.That is not the blade\'s fault - it\'s mine! But I can\'t imagine I\'m the only one whose done this. I know we\'re all careful with blades, but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.But - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised. If you need a clean shave for thick stubble, this should work for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I always found that women\'s razors worked better for this area because men\'s razors are meant for the face (I use the Gillette Fusion for this every other day activity) and have tried quite a bit since I started with this habit back in 2002/2003.  Like with the men\'s razors the products keep getting better with time and the Venus Spa Breeze is no exception.  With this latest incarnation the soap has been attached to the blades and a nice scent has been added as upgrades.  The old Venus blades always worked great but this upgrade is definitely a worthwhile one.  The pros are that the soap produced makes for a smoother shave and more clean and the smell really is nice.  The cons are that I would imagine these new blades are much more $$$ than the old Venus razors with regular cream and the soap attached doesn\'t allow you the same kind of control that you had before.If you like not having to lather up and don\'t mind spending the extra money this is a fine product.  If you want to save some cash and just use lather + the standard Venus product you can\'t go wrong there either.  Gillette makes the best razors around and I don\'t think they will be losing the shaving title any time soon.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve been keeping a bald head for about 6 weeks now and this razor is a huge improvement from the twin. Several men\'s bald type websites had noted advantages with the 5 blade. Some say power, some say not. If I space it, and use the razor without the power- I notice it on cleanup for sure. My hair was thin on top so either way- that area is smooth.

When Gillette made the Trac II razor blades they made perfection. They still sell  razors for these today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4212,1593,20090722,B001JQLNFA,2,"July 22, 2009",A3NV2COCU1EFC3,Don\'t Throw Away the Shaving Cream Yet,"Let me preface this review by saying that I hate shaving. I shave a lot of stuff- legs, arms, armpits, bikini area, and my big toe. I can get away with shaving some areas once a week, but my legs need to be shaved at least every other day during the summer or there is visable black stubble. I have very sensitive skin that often gets razor burn and ingrown hairs. So I got this thinking, perfect! Three blades= close shave; built in shave gel= more convenient and faster.Well, there are several issues with this razor. During the first use, I noticed two things: One, there is a lot of slobbery goop coming off the razor... and two, the shave gel bars that sit above and below the blades make it very difficult to get a close shave. They do flex a little, but especially when they are new, they are cumbersome and they block the blades from getting close enough to the skin, especially in contoured areas like the knee and the bikini area. It does moisturize well, though, and at least for the first use or two, you won\'t need to use any shaving cream. I didn\'t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn\'t able to shave.By the third use, those gel bars have worn down a little (or a lot) and you can get a closer shave. But now with less slobbery gel goop, you are very likely to have irritated skin or little cuts. I have to use soap to lubricate my skin before shaving if the cartridge is not brand new, and I keep cutting my armpit with this razor and I didn\'t seem to have that problem with the regular Venus razor.The gel is either gone or falls off by about the fifth or sixth use. These cartridges are just way too expensive to have to replace them so often. I found that leaving the razor in the shower cuts it\'s life even shorter so I keep it in a cupboard when I\'m not using it... so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn\'t serve much purpose. Maybe if you are the only one who uses your shower and you shave every time you\'re in there you can get some use out of it.I like using this on my legs during the summer when I shave every day and I don\'t want to spend the extra time with shaving cream. I don\'t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble. I wouldn\'t buy this again- the regular Venus is easier to maneuver and shaves closer. Even if I have to buy shaving cream again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

It prevents razor burn as well as pulling and tugging.  With this design, it is not necessary to use shaving cream or soap for a lubricant.The downside of these razors is that there is no guard so when they get wet, the lotion bars fall off before they are all used up.

It also acts as neat little buffer to keep the user from knicking herself.No need for shaving cream at all and the process is smooth and fast.I love this razor and I will definitely be getting more even if it does cost a little more. It is definitely worth it.What doesn\'t work so well is the shower hook for the razor. It kept popping off the shower wall but with a razor this good, I can overlook that.

The lather part will get used up too quickly, that I can tell after just one use.  I used it on my underarms and lower legs.  Due to the parts that are there for the moisturizing cream stuff protruding too far I couldn\'t get a close shave.  I\'d rather use a regular razor and my shaving cream.  Neither my underarms or legs got a close shave.

6425,2736,20110421,B004QE83VE,2,"April 21, 2011",AUITG1DJ3QUGK,"better than many disposables, with some caveats","I have reviewed a number of products which I tried because my teenaged daughter wanted them and I had concerns... and so used myself as a test subject.  In this case, it is somewhat reversed.  She has been using Venus razors for some time; absolutely insists on them to my dismay, as they are a good deal more expensive than any other disposable razor that I am aware of.  So, when the opportunity presented itself I decided to try it and see why she was so wholly sold on the product.I will preface my remarks on this razor by noting that I have so butchered myself with disposable razors in the past that I gave them up entirely for electric (which, I will note, are a good deal better than they used to be).  That said, for me this trial serves several purposes.1. How likely was I (or she) to cut myself with it?2. Did it provide a better shave than an electric?3. how does it compare to other disposables?I put off the test for quite a bit reminiscing on discovering a trail of blood as I left the bathroom (and having sworn the entire routine off years ago).It did pass the crucial first test.  I managed to shave my legs without bloodying myself.  I think the moisturizing pad helped here.  that said, I *really* do not like the moisturizer.  It smells like fabric softener to me :p and does not feel as good as either a real moisturizer (which you would use after you shave) or provide as much glide as other creams or gels.  I found it mildly offensive.  that took a star off.2. Compared to the electric, it was not as easy to use; involved a bit more fussing: insert (or, as one will ultimately have to) changing the blade.  It was a little bit of a closer shave, but also left my legs feeling scraped.... not as good as my skin felt on the leg I did with the electric (knock off one more star).3. Compared to other disposables, it is not any closer per se but may save one pass.  HOWEVER, the blades get much more clogged and are more difficult to clean than twin blade razors.When you think about it, really it is just one blade which is doing the cutting, the second or third is for what you miss on the first pass.Having tried it, do I think it is worth the extra cost?  NO (resoundingly) but sincerely doubt I will be able to reason with her ;)In sum, yes it shaves a bit closer than an electric.  All blade razors do.I found this one to be safer than most (a plus) but did not like the scent or feel of the moisturizer and my skin felt more raw than when I use the electric.I did not find that it provided a closer shave than other disposables, or permanent blade razors, and do find it harder to clean.In my view the positives and negatives more or less balance each other out and what you are left with is a very expensive disposable.  Myself, I will not be buying this product, though doubt my reasoning will have much impact on the shopping habits of my teenager ;)Edited to note that I brought this with me on vacation (more portable than an electric) and a week later have so many ingrown hairs; it\'s awful!  This never happened with any other razor I have used.  I will not be using it again (and will seriously discourage my daughter from same).  Who wants to risk infections or scars?  I don\'t!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.

130,135,20110620,B00005AUIE,5,"June 20, 2011",AOY1BUICNSYYK,Back to the Basics,"I started with the Gilette Venus a few years ago -- over the years i have tried their newer razor inventions( Divine, Pro Skin, Breeze, Embrace). Even though they were fun to try -- they all had cons to them like the the gel/soap around the razor being slimy and lasting only a week, which meant spending a lot more $$$ on razors than i would have liked to.In the end i returned to the classic Gilette Venus. Not only is it the cheapest razor from the Gilette Venus line,  but it also leaves my legs silky smooth. In order to achieve the most silkiest feeling legs i rub body butter on my legs after the shave/shower.The razor itself is great. It is really hard to  cut yourself, unless you go up or down with the razor sideways-- this will result in a clean cut, but it will be deep and will bleed.  Leaving the razor in the shower/bath will make it rust/dull faster due to the moisture so make sure to wipe off the razor after your shower and store it away (even if it is in a drawer) it will prolong the cartridges life. Also when it dulls it will leave your legs not that smooth and with little stubble -- so don\'t forge to change those cartridges.This box does not come with a razor, it is just the cartridges and each cartridge is individually packed. It is simple to replace the cartridges on the razor, just pop off the old cartridge, open the new cartridge packet, and pop the razor into the new cartridge. Done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trimmer is single blade and not very useful. 2) Different blade design means you can\'t use M3 blades.

To make a long explanation short, this razor is tremendous, and it gets the job done in every way. When it comes to shaving my head completely bald and shaving my face (and under my chin), it delivers a very close shave and the results speak for themselves.

I WILL LOOK NO FURTHER.","(This is Lisa\'s son speaking.)Shaving has been a frustrating and embarrassing experience for me for years.  There has always been some kind of trade-off between closeness, irritation, tendency to produce ingrown hairs, price, and speed of use.  I never understood how my friends and family members were able to achieve a close and fast shave on a regular basis, while I would shave twice as slowly and get a shave half as good as theirs. I\'ve tried manual razors, electric foil razors, and electric rotary razors.  I had settled on manual razors (only shaving with the grain) because it produced the least irritation and didn\'t leave patches of uncut hairs like all the electric ones I\'ve tried.  Unfortunately, due to my pattern of beard growth, manual razors tended to leave me with ingrown hairs all along my jawline, despite my best efforts to prevent them.  I had figured that I had to settle for dealing with them until now.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best of the manual and electric shaving worlds.  It provides a much closer, faster, consistent, and comfortable shave with no ingrown hairs whatsoever.  Superior in all ways.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

There is also one called Everblade that supposedly also works.After spending something like $45 on Mach 3 blades at the department store some weeks back, in order to have a few months supply, I decided to try one of these blade extenders that supposedly allows you to get a whole lot more shaves out of razor blades.With the Razorpit, I am at least getting about 3 times as many shaves per blade.  Some people have said they get like 100-200 shaves per blade.  I guess the key is that these blades don\'t lose their efficacy after a few shaves because they go dull, but because they accumulate gunk.

While this is a good blade and a very smooth system, I don\'t really notice much (if any) of an improvement over the Fusion system.

It did take some getting used to in the beginning figuring out the angle to get the best cut with the upper and lower moisturizing bars sticking out further than the blade, but now it\'s a \'breeze\'.  It\'s also nice that you don\'t have to worry about applying shaving cream to hard to reach places or that it will wash off - it\'s always on your razor!  As a busy mom with a one and three year old, I\'m not shaving every day, but I definitely found myself shaving more often because it took less time.

As is turned out, the ProGlide is better and noticeably so.  There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face.  It also seems like I\'m been getting a closer shave.  The best part of the ProGlide is that your can use your old Fusion handles to attach the blades onto.  No need to buy special ProGlide handles.  The only bad part that I have noticed so far is that the ProGlide seems to wear down much faster than the old Fusion.  I have to replace the ProGlide blades about a week earlier than I used to with the old Fusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impressed by some great reviews here, I decided to give this a try.Using my old Sensor or Mach3/Mach3 turbo I had irritation, averaged 2-3 nicks or cuts per shave, and the razors weren\'t up to cleanly shaving a few difficult areas of my face (under the ear for example).Using this thing, this wondrous Fusion Power Razor, left me with as many, or more, irritated areas, averaged 5+ nicks or cuts per use, and it couldn\'t cleanly shave even the areas the other two razors have no problem with.  Plus, it actually gets stuck shaving against the grain.I\'m serious, it stops moving and you have to put more pressure on it, bear down harder, to get it to move which, of course, results in those extra cuts and irritation, and then it still misses patches of beard you just tried to shave.This is just a waste of money.  The technology behind this is only different, not better.  No doubt it\'s the 5 blade foolishness that makes it stop moving in rougher sections of the beard, and the power blade vibration seems to accomplish nothing at all.I\'m convinced that the rave reviews here are from people new to shaving, people who have light beards, or people getting paid to promote the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought it on amazon and used it in NJ. Here is my take on this Razor:1. The handle grip is awesome, very confortable.2. The blades, where are they ? does it have blades? Which means i dont feel like there is a blade, they are so thin, its really glides on my face.3. Vibrations, they are soooo soothing, i think i would recommend a buy not without it, it doubles the gliding pleasure. Dont buy the manual one (my very personal opinion, you can if you want :-) )4. The shave is so close, even if you shave against the grain, it works like WOWWWW.5. My skin is little extra sensitive, so i do get razor bumps near my throat, but i dont think thats because of the razor, i get in all Razors or electronic shavers (i have Norelco Speed XL).6. I use it with art of shaving kit. Its the best partner.7. I also feel those who shave there pubic areas, this blade will be a extra plus because of extra thin blades and very little space between each blade, less chances of cuts. (i have not tried it though ;-)).The best deal is when you buy it with the extra Cartridges.The shipping was prompt and on time.Overall i am impressed, give me some more stars to add :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

Yes it does state you need to change blades every time the blue strip goes away.  But to be honest with you theres no way your blue strip goes away that quick to where it would require 10 times a month!  you must be shaving your whole body, legs, arms and face!  i shave my face daily, and if i went off of the blue strips then i would be stupid!  because my blue strips last longer then what i feel is the life span of one of these blades.  i go through about 2 blades a month and each blade ive thrown out has the blue strip still but it was faded some what.  yes i have seen the blue strip completely disappear as well.back to the review though.  i would really encourage people to opt for the turbo vs the original or even the vibrating one!  original is cheap  yes, but the turbo feels better on sensitive skin, and the virbrating one i think its a waste of money!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6401,2712,20120208,B004QE83VE,4,"February 8, 2012",A2JJO0DNB4QV0O,"Great, for as long as they last","As many others have pointed out on the page for the refill cartridges, the \'shave gel\' bars on these razors don\'t last very long. One wouldn\'t expect them to last for months, but more than a 2-3 showers seems reasonable at this price point. The blades themselves are good, though, and last considerably longer after the moisture bars have worn down, so it can still be effectively used with shaving lotion -- which, of course, defeats the point of this skip-a-step design. I gave it 4 stars anyway because it *does* -- for the first shave or two -- do as promised, give you a simple nick-free shaving experience without using any additional gel/lotion/cream. Also be aware that they\'re superior to \'normal\' razors primarily just on long, smooth planes of skin, like legs or forearms. In smaller or less flat areas the moisture blades may not actually be able to make contact with your skin because, by necessity, they do not sit exactly flush with the razor blades. (Aside: other reviewers have said they\'ve gotten these cartridges to last longer by mounting the storage hook somewhere other than the shower, i.e. someplace dry. Will try that and report back.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From my first shave I have been delighted. It really gives the smoothest shave. On the back side of the cartridge is a single blade for the bottom of sideburns and under the nose and other hard to reach places. The cartridges are expensive but they last me for months. This 8-count package should last me for a couple years of happy shaving. I wouldn\'t go anywhere without it and I keep an extra one in my gym bag.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6300,2610,20111118,B004B8AZH0,1,"November 18, 2011",A7G3BFZ5XUBJ1,Are these duplicates?,"Last year I got a  gift of Gillette razor and two 5-blade cartridges. They were superb in performance gliding easy on my skin. They lasted for almost 12 months; yes, one full year. Encouraged from this experience I ordered these cartridges[ASIN:B004B8AZH0 Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, 12-Count] from Amazon. In fact, I subscribed to receive a supply every six months. These new blades do not shave the way the ealier ones did. There is no comparison. These ones do not glide smoothly, I need to pull the razor and it makes scraping sound! As if I am sharpening a razor on a leather belt! The quality of shave is not at all close and clean and it irritates the skin. I was so much impressed with earlier Gillette experience that I did not contact Amazon immediately and kept trying different blades.... even after 3 or 4 different cartridges still no luck.The mineral oil is missing in the strip. Very poor experience....and I have now decided to return the unused cattridges and cancel my subsciption for future supply.Update : 01/04/2012My earlier experience was with Fusion Proglide! And, this review covers Fusion. There is noticeable difference in experience from Fusion and Fusion proglide. I can not understand why Gillette should have very similar nomneclature for two different products which led to this confusion. My repeat experience with Fusion Proglide blades is excellent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you hardly have any hair, you probably don\'t really need it.i have tried ***ALL*** the Venus collection and many others, so take it from a pro!!! i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far. First it covers a much larger area so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors. A few strokes and you\'re done. i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!! i read a reviewer\'s comment saying that Embrace is the same as a 1 blade razor. NO WAY!! this one doesn\'t even compare to the one with 3 blades!!it is so practical, you don\'t need to go over the same area more than once or twice. the smoothing \'bands\' (meant for exfoliation i suppose) seem to assist the shaving because they smoothe the area perfectly. i was TOTALLY IMPRESSED with this one. The head is very flexible so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts. i have a sensitive skin but it is hard to cut yourself with this one - unless you overdo it or if you have very little hair. You don\'t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).i read a review by a man who uses this razor, well i use men\'s foam! i DON\'T use the foaming gels made for women. they foam much less than men\'s products. i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target\'s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper prices.i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product. Venus Embrace, that is. i hate shaving, and this one definitely makes it less unpleasant for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These latest ProGlide cartridges are excellent, but they do have a major downside: they don\'t last as long as previous Fusion blades. However, they are sharper, causing less discomfort. Also just like the old Fusion blades, you have to be really absent minded to get a nick. I\'d say on average I get about 4-10 shaves out of them before I become frustrated and throw them away. That compares to about 6-15 with the old blades. I think they\'re worth it though, because they are simply the nicest, easiest, most comfortable way to shave. Far prefer them to fancy electric razors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it does work on my legs, I wouldn\'t say it\'s noticeably more impressive. But for me what really mattered is that it is SO hard to use on my underarms. I have to pull the skin across the bone and then  try to shave to get the lower part of my underarm because the thing is too bulky and there is way too much plastic to get a smooth shave. Since I can get a smooth shave with a cheapy razor, I think I\'d rather stick with that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5634,1935,20110611,B003983HZK,5,"June 11, 2011",AESXR5WVO087C,Highly recommend!,"I remember when fusion first came out and a friend sung its praise. Back then I was using Hydro and was satisfied and not willing to change. Then proglide comes out and that same friend described how proglide crushed the fusion in terms of the best shaving experience he ever had. By then I had already made my mind up to give proglide a try based on a thinner blade. As you will see here the overwhelming majority of people including me find this the best shave ever. What I find is I feel like its not shaving it is so easy to use and the results are a smooth shave no bumps or irration. Yes, very expensive and when I tried to go back to hydro I longed for proglide so here I am very satisfied albeit the price is high but my hopes are the price will drop a bit. I wish hydro would come up with a thinner blade because it really does matter. Everyones shaving experience is different but I am able to use the blade a minimum of 5 times before the blade degrades. I did find it challenging to shave moustache area but with time it has gotten better. I do shave my head as well with great ease too. Proglide really changed the shaving game. Highly recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without further ado here are her comments.\'This was my first time trying a 5-blade razor.  I normally use a 3-blade Venus Breeze which I really like, but the 5-blade blew it away!  I especially liked the lotion around the blade, that soothed and moisturized as I shaved.  The shave was extremely close and smooth, and required many less passes to get to that point.  I definitely will be buying replacement blades for this product and recommending it to my friends.\'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let\'s be honest, you can\'t get too picky over your Deodorant.  It\'s pretty much a thought of Does it smell good??  That said, in my opinion their are 4 areas to judge when it comes to a really thorough review of an Anti-perspirant/Deodorant- Anti-perspirant ability: 3 starsIt doesn\'t seem to stop the perspiration if I get hot, e.g. in a hot car.  No perspiration when doing daily work in the office.  If you have an excess of perspiration in your arm pits, this is going to do a better job than most others.  The real benefit is that it doesn\'t go on white and clumpy.- Odor protection: 5 starsAll I can smell is this stuff - no odor is getting through this!- Scent: 3.5 starsA little strong for me, but not a terrible smell- Application: 5 starsGoes on smooth without clumping -- no white residue!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whenever it starts to get dull, I can keep the razor itself and just change out the blades. Even the blades seem to last a long time, at least for me. I only have to change them once every six months. I like this because it has a moisture strip, but it\'s small. The razors with big moisture strips are absolutely ridiculous; I\'m assuming you\'re supposed to use those for when you have no soap to use because those basically provide the soap for you, which I find annoying. I haven\'t tried any 5-blade razors or anything like that so I don\'t have much to compare this to, but it\'s a good razor I\'ve had for years that has never let me down, and I love the color.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This month we\'ve had fourteen days in a row where the temperature was 100 degrees or hotter. During an average year we have over a hundred days like that, and reached 122 on one memorable day many years back. As you can imagine, one needs a fairly good deoderant here.This particular deoderant works quite well! I haven\'t any complaints so far. It\'s not staining my shirt, it\'s got a really nice scent and it goes on smooth and easy. It\'s also keeping me from, you know, stinking like a pig in poo.If this deoderant works well for someone in Phoenix at the start of the summer, you can rest assured it\'s going to work well for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their price is going up like they\'re made out of gold, so I took a look at my options.I picked up a pack of these Gillete Custom Plus razors.  It was about half the price, for the same count, as buying Mach 3 cartridges.  The razor heads look almost identical, so I thought I was getting one over on Gillette.Turns out I wasn\'t.  These just aren\'t nearly as good as a Mach 3, unfortunately.  I would say that a brand new Custom Plus feels about like a two week old Mach 3 cartridge.  It\'s livable, but I feel more razor burn, have a few small nicks, and the shave just isn\'t as close as I would like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, it is not worth your money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was so light.  I ran my hand down the length of my leg and it was soooo smooth!  The contour pivoting head was so awesome as well.  I have knobby type knees and this thing just glided over them like it was skiing the Alps.  Then I gave it the ultimate challenge.  I hadn\'t tended to the bikini area for awhile so I gave that a go.  This razor just took care of all the business there like it was baby fine hair (which it was NOT).I like the fact that it comes with a suction cup razor holder but be sure to place this strategically in your shower or bathtub so no water runs directly on it because it will lose suction and you don\'t want to have water pouring over the Olay moisture bars.  I have used this razor for at least two weeks now (a total of 8 times) and the moisture bar does not look to have dwindled in size at all.  The blades (5 of them!) still seem ultra sharp.I definitely recommend this razor and honestly...I might toss the Mach one in the trash and use this baby full time.  The ONLY downside is that the moisture bar contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate and anyone who follows my reviews knows how I feel about that ingredient.  So, I am giving this product 4 stars only because of the SLS content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You don\'t need a set of safe cracking tools to open the plastic wrapping - there\'s a perforation for easy opening!  At last!Next you\'ll notice the storage pod that holds the razor and two spare cartridges.  The pod attaches to the wall with a couple of suction cups.  (Much nicer than the adhesive strips some manufacturers want you to use to attach their products to your walls!)  The pod is cute, but I don\'t stick things to the walls - so my pod and extra cartridges are going into a drawer.The main event is the razor itself.  The gel handle is very comfortable and the razor feels well balanced in the hand.  The head is wider than usual - a good feature when shaving the legs, may be kind of dicey on the underarms.  Another nice feature is the moisture strip which increases the glide factor on the skin, although it doesn\'t entirely eliminate the need for shaving gel or foam.The razor head shaves close and doesn\'t nick - at least the first time you use it.  The actual blades are on the thin / flimsy side, so you\'ll be changing the cartridge with above average frequency.  I don\'t know that a five blade head shaves any better / closer / faster than three blades, or two, or even one - but a five blade head does seem to clog up up more and faster than the others.  You\'ll be interrupting your shave quite a bit for rinsing and tapping.In summary, there are lots of cute features - the pod, the gel handle, the extra wide head and moisture strip.  The five blade head looks impressive, but the blades are flimsy and clog up five times as fast as a single blade.  Three and a half stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It went on smooth and comfortably and it disappeared and was dry very quickly.Protection wise it\'s great.  When I read that it has a masking fragrance I was concerned that masking might mean overpowering or I\'d smell like freshly washed guy with too much cologne, luckily I was in for a surprise.  The scent of this, on application, is almost unnoticeable- it does smell a little bit like \'unscented deodorant\' (which to my sensitive nose still has a scent) but then nothing- absolutely nothing.  I was thrilled! I have a sensitive nose and sensitive skin and neither were agitated by Gillette clinical strength anti-perspirant.I think this would be great for people who sweat a ton or if working hard in a very humid environment.

It\'s not the most comfortable shave you\'ll ever have but it\'s better than a four blade lol.

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

If you are not an everyday shaver (sometimes I don\'t shave on the weekends or holiday breaks) you will suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth of growth. Also, I found that I simply wasn\'t getting as close a shave as I did with the Mach3, even when shaving every day. I agree that there was less irritation, but only slightly so. I do miss the sideburn blade and the heft of the handle, but I\'m happy that I returned it and purchased more blades from my Mach 3 Power instead--for me, at least, this wasn\'t an improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Manual razors, especially disposable ones, are more effective for me, but with my skin as sensitive as it is, I\'m usually decorating my face with little bits of tissue when I\'m through.With this razor, I get the best of all worlds.  With 5 blades, it\'s hard to miss a spot, and it takes less time overall to get the job done.  The vibrating gives it an extra \'kick\' and makes the shave more effective.  The best part is that there is virtually no sign of irritation.For those who are having trouble using this razor against 2- or 3-day-old beards, just be patient and let the razor (and its vibrations) do the work.  Pull your skin so the part you\'re shaving is good and tight and the stubble is separated as much as possible.This razor gives me, by far, the closest shave ever, and with no irritation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They provide a close shave with very little pressure; I never get nicks.  I actually used one of the 3-blade Venus cartridges that I had left over not too long ago...I almost bled to death!!  And they last forever without getting dull!  As far as the shower pod goes, it hangs on my shower wall without a problem unless I bang into it.  I don\'t really use it to hold extra cartridges though, for two reasons:  1.  if you change the blade in the shower, what do you do with the trash? 2.  it only holds two cartridges and you can\'t buy just two cartridges so there\'s always some stored somewhere else anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the powered Fusion the manual one allows for incredible flexibility and a truly close but comfortable shave. In retrospect, my problem with the powered version is that the \'micropulses\' take away your control and the vibrations will cause you to press harder on your skin (leading to nicks, cuts and razor burn). I\'ve been using the manual Fusion razor for almost two weeks now and am so impressed that I\'ve stopped using the Schick Quattro Midnight altogether. All in all I give the manual Gillette Fusion razor my highest recommendation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He wanted me to stop shaving with a razor because of how often I was cutting myself.I\'m glad to say that is not an issue with the Proglide blades. One thing I appreciate about them is that Gillette improved upon the lubricating strips -- they really do make a difference for me and make the shave smoother. I get a smooth shave and do not cut myself.I also appreciate the Amazon subscription service. These blades are ridiculously expensive at the grocery store: I\'ve seen them charge $18 for four blades!

2317,1229,20110217,B0013MTHWQ,5,"February 17, 2011",A2SB0OKNB1ODN5,Closest shave I\'ve ever had - and no nicks!,"These razors give the smoothest, most comfortable shave I\'ve ever had. I can run the razor over my skin fast, with very light pressure, and it still shaves perfectly. For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area. With every other razor (even the Breeze, which was my prior favorite) I had to slow way down and go carefully or I\'d nick myself in those spots. So I can shave faster! I shave in the shower, and I don\'t find shave gel or foam to be necessary.My problems with razor burn and bumps in the underarm and bikini area are over. Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions. With previous razors I had to shave those spots repeatedly in different directions, using a lot of pressure, to get a close shave. That lead to painful razor burn, and so most of the time I just tolerated a rough shave there. No more! I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure. Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.There are two things I don\'t like about the Embrace cartridges:Cost: They\'re expensive! But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher cost.The size: They\'re big. The only reason this is a problem for me is the shower pod: Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they *don\'t* fit in the Breeze shower pod.  I ended up buying an Embrace starter pack with a handle and shower pod so I could store the cartridges in the shower pod.  I didn\'t realize until I opened the starter pack that the Embrace shower pod only holds *two* cartridges. So when you open a 4-pack of cartridges, you\'ll have to keep the extra cartridges somewhere else. One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else. It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \'cute\' over making it useful for storage. At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall so it doesn\'t get knocked onto the shower floor and stepped on.(Another reviewer reported that the shower pod keeps detaching from the wall. I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn\'t get bumped and rarely gets splashed. It\'s remained firmly attached for months. I also have a fiberglass shower. I don\'t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy tile.)Summary: The Embrace cartridge gives a truly superior shave. It\'s worth every cent.EDIT: April 11, 2011: Wouldn\'t you know it, shortly after I wrote this glowing review I got a bad batch. The bad cartridges didn\'t shave as smoothly and I had some mild razor burn with them. They also seemed to dull more quickly. Since the bad batch I had tried another box and they worked well again. I am not changing my five-star rating yet, but I will be paying attention to whether the bad box was a fluke, or a warning of quality control problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

282,291,20091116,B0001LQGG0,4,"November 16, 2009",AAYJA4GME03V6,"Truly Divine? Well, Close Enough","I\'ve been using Venus Divine blades for years. I love that they fit on any Venus razor; although, they best match the Divine handle because of the blue text on the blade. They\'re rounded so there\'s no sharp edges. However, they can sometimes be bulky when it comes to feminine curves. Because there are no wires over the blades, the Venus Divine razor is quite easy to rinse off. It doesn\'t have as many nooks and crannies which attract hair, soap or cream like the Quattro blades.Overall, I love the Divine razors. I always get a great shave on my legs and underarms. Those areas don\'t require any shaving cream with Divine\'s multiple moisture strips. I rarely cut myself and irritation around the bikini line and intimate areas is minimal when used with a good shaving cream. The comfort coated blades glide quite smoothly over the skin without catching or scraping, with help from the smoothing cushions. I believe both of those features are only on the Divine razor blades, not the regular Venus blades.The moisture strips add moisture you can touch to the blades (much more-so than the original Venus blades); although, it can feel a bit slimy if you leave it in the shower (the slimyness and moisture both fade over time). The moisture strips are supposed to fade when it\'s time to refill but I\'ve honestly never noticed it so I just replace when I feel like I am not getting an awesome shave anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6017,2325,20101201,B003EMNITQ,2,"December 1, 2010",A1BJOHHLG0D965,"Not a fan. Cuts my skin, not a close shave, requires too much pressure to bring blades in contact with skin.","I recently discovered Gillette\'s Venus line of razors (I know, they\'ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite). Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \'what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel so I don\'t have to lather up my skin?\'. Apparently, something other than these Venus Spa refills with the shave gel built in.I don\'t know; maybe I just got a bad batch of razor cartridges, but the one that I opened up doesn\'t really release any shave gel until I\'ve moved well beyond a leg or forearm or two. When it DOES release that gel, it\'s more as a concentrated, thin \'string\' of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair. Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger\'s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor\'s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \'lips\' to get the \'teeth\' to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it\'s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades. Just not well executed.I\'d read all of the reviews for the single packs of Venus Spa cartridges, so I knew that there\'d be a 50/50 shot that I\'d actually like these, but putting them into use for myself solidified it for me. You shouldn\'t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that\'s what I feel like I need to get these to work right. As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I\'ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges. At this rate, I\'d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much. THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference. THESE razor cartridges? Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o\'clock shadow every day, and I didn\'t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble! If you like one of Gillette\'s other types of Venus cartridges, stick with those. As has been proven to me before, the grass ISN\'T always greener on the other side! And the stubble may actually be longer!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

5913,2219,20111205,B0039LMT9C,5,"December 5, 2011",A3EADWE0F3A1J6,Amazing!,"First I have to commend Venus on there packaging. We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs. I love it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought I was the only one who noticed this and switched to a Braun electric razor but if you read the other reviews you\'ll see that other men have done this as well.I got the Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver for $199.99 about a year ago, and periodically (right now for example) you can get $50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $130.00. So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I\'m def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need. I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream (have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $40.00 for a years worth) and I never get irritated skin anymore.So now I spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 = $225.00 for the first year and a half I\'ve used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing= $565.00So Gillette Fusion, or comparable manual razors, cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor. Most men might not change their blades as often as I did but the things got dull so quick I don\'t see how it could be avoided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean overall the head is pretty big I say, even if the blades are small.Of course the biggest concern is since the blades are so close together, that they are going to get clogged up.Well I bought it from the store yesterday, and just got done shaving with it right now..  Wow.... For one it really has cut the time it usually takes to shave.  That\'s considering all the other shavers i\'ve ever had... It really has cut the time...It is scary cause it feels like the blades are sticking to your skin, yet the whole shave is surpisingly smooth.  I was able to shave under my nose and under my lips, and not a single cut, or even the sense that I\'d be cut.It really made short work of my face... Which I personally only shave once or twice a week.  So my hair does grow over the week.Surpisingly not once did I have to actually Clean the blades, or try really hard to get the gunk out.  Everything just seemed to clean just fine under the water.However this is the reason I am giving it a 4 stars rather then a 5 stars (but seriously is there such a thing as the perfect razor in the first place?).  I feel that these blades won\'t last as long as say the mach 3 power blades..  Just cause they are so close together.  While I was really happy with the first shave and how smooth it was.  I feel like i\'m waiting for something to happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don\'t recommend that, but you\'ve gotta do what you\'ve gotta do. Mach3 may be on the expensive side but they last longer and work better (very smooth shave) than any blade I\'ve tried.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I shave and trim my beard, so I figured it would be nice to have them all in one. The fact that they come from Gillette gave me the confidence to try it without hesitation about the quality of the product.

I find the Venus Breeze heads are much better than the intuition heads - the head is smaller so you can get a better shave.  I do find that the gel bars can get a bit sticky, but overall these give you a really good shave.  I\'ve never used the \'spa\' breeze but I don\'t notice them being any different from the other venus breeze heads, and I really don\'t find there to be a huge difference from one scent to the next.

I still found I needed a regular razor for other areas as after you use this for a little while it gets really goopy and slick and is hard to shave in curved areas.

1666,566,20061115,B000BUUVTE,4,"November 15, 2006",AOMMNU2TZ67WY,A review from a \'beginner\',"First let me qualify myself as someone who last used a non-electric razor when I was 18...over 25 years ago. Thus the beginner tag. I stopped using a bladed razor because of cuts. For years I kind of accepted an average shave from electric razors because I just knew a blade would cut my face. I even grew a goatee because I could not get a clean shave on my chin. About two weeks ago I received an unsolicited free Gillette Fusion in the mail. I just sat it on my desk and figured I would toss it out eventually. Something inside told me to \'research\' it on the Net. I did and decided to give it a whack come Monday morning (Nov. 6). After perusing these reviews I decided to not buy the Fusion gels. I instead bought the Face Scrub, Shaving Gel and Post Shave Lotion of the Neutrogena Men, Razor Defense line. Let\'s just say I did not know I needed a Face Scrub product. :-)With some trepedition I went ahead with my \'test.\' I could not believe how gently the Fusion glided across my face. And, just as importantly, what an improvement over my electric razor. I honestly do not think I could cut myself if I tried. Okay, of course I could. :-)I recommend this razor. I have not used Mach3, Sensor, etc. so I can\'t say it is better or worse. But I like it.P.S. The cartridges are, of course, overpriced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But after shaving twice, the moisture strips on the top and bottom got kind of dry and then I knicked myself a lot and got ingrown hairs on my armpits for the first time. I changed the blade and it was great again, but after a week both moisture strips fell off and the blades got really dull. It wasn\'t really worth replacing the razor so often. Also,never use it with shaving cream, as it clogs the razor. Overall, I\'d reccomend any Venus razor EXCEPT this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6011,2319,20120326,B003EMNITQ,4,"March 26, 2012",A1OIDJ7WTJ8O,still undecided,Mom loves these and asked me to order so I got them for me too.

26,26,20120301,B000052YHS,5,"March 1, 2012",A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,I keep coming back to the Mach3,"I\'ve tried many razors over the years including various electrics, and when I don\'t have a beard I always come back to the Mach3. The Mach3 was introduced by Gillette in 1998, and while I don\'t remember exactly when I bought a Mach3 set (or \'system,\' i.e., a handle and two blades), it was probably in 1998 or 1999. Since then I\'ve gone through a number of blades but have never replaced the handle, because I haven\'t had to.I have a pretty tough beard and have to shave daily if I want (or feel obliged) to look clean shaven.According to the current Wikipedia entry for the Mach3, the blades cost 9 cents to produce. I\'ve read conflicting stories about the history of disposable razor blades and I\'m not sure what to believe. But it seems to me that disposable razor blades and cartridge type blades in particular, like printer inks, are high profit margin items that deserve to be characterized as ripoffs. I recently tried using old fashioned double edge razors, the kind I stated with when I started shaving in the last sixties - I not only have my own old double-edge blade holder but have two even older ones that I inherited from my late dad - but as has always been my experience, I could not get through a shave without an annoying cut or two (and then I end up going out with little pieces of bloody tissue stuck to my face). If I thought I could get a clean, bloodless shave with a straight razor I\'d go that route. Electric razors can be okay in a pinch but it takes too much time and effort for me to get a really clean shave with an electric, and even then it\'s never as clean as the shave I can get with a Mach3. (I discovered Aveeno shave gel a few years ago and though I don\'t have sensitive skin, I\'ve found that it works better for me than any other gel or cream I\'ve used.)Obviously, not all guys have as good an experience with the Mach3 as I\'ve had, and that makes sense, because every guy\'s beard and skin is different.When I have more than a couple of day\'s growth, I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1795,697,20080609,B000BUUVTY,1,"June 9, 2008",A2V99RXY8L0HL7,What happened to the blade quality after the free sample?,"Last year I received a free Fusion handle and blade in the mail from Gillette. Tried it and got the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had. I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.That sample Fusion blade lasted about 3 months (I kid you not) and I do have a heavy beard. Wow, I thought. These blades are expensive, but if I didn\'t have to change them as often, it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills. The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.I purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out. What the heck? After about a week the replacement blade was dull. I went through the 4 pack in about a month and bought a second pack at another retailer. Same thing. One week=1 blade.Gillette must really think we\'re stupid. Give the suckers a free sample that\'s great and make them pay for crummy blades after they\'ve committed to the system. Never again, Gillette.....I just ordered a Braun cordless from Amazon so you can just go pick someones else\'s pocket.Edited: Any suckers our there still letting Gillette rip them off? Yeah, I guess so since they\'re still in business. The Braun electric I mention above has recently been relegated to backup status to my Merkur double edge razor. Yep, one of those things like my dad used and that I learned to shave with. Blades cost about 7 cents each in bulk and last about a week. Let\'s see...that a penny a shave for the blades plus a few cents worth of TOBS shave cream. Give it a try and tell Gillette what they can do with the Fusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1721,622,20060206,B000BUUVTY,4,"February 6, 2006",A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,Nice Shave But I\'ll Stick With The M3 Power,"I have been using Gillette\'s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it\'s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette\'s other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6459,2773,20111221,B0057D7Y36,1,"December 21, 2011",A25UZ7MA72SMKM,Truly horrible concoction,"I got a sample of this with my Proglide razor trimmer. There were about two shaves worth of this in the sample I received. I used one and immediately threw the rest in the trash.It was like trying to shave with Crisco. It was very oily and hard to wash off my hands. It did the worst job of softening my beard of ANY shaving cream or gel I\'ve ever used, then after the shave, was equally difficult to completely wash the residue off my face.The (brand new) razor blade was left with this stuff gunked up between the blades as if I had run it through a can of solid Crisco shortening. I don\'t know how much hot water (VERY hot) I had to use before it finally all washed out of the blades, but it was far too much.The shave itself was similar to when I\'ve been caught on a trip without shaving cream and used bath soap to lather with, in that it makes it possible, but not comfortable. I\'d rather use bath soap to shave with than this stuff, and I\'m not exaggerating in making that statement.I have used Edge shaving gel for years. In contrast to this product, Edge does not leave an oily residue on my hands, does soften my beard (and my beard is a bit on the tough side), does not need intense scrubbing to remove from my face, and does not imbed itself into the razor blades. With Edge and a new blade, I never have any \'pull\' on a shave. My first, last, and only shave with this mess was an irritating pull on every shaving stroke (yes, with a brand new first time ever used blade).I\'m a big fan of the Fusion razors, but whoever invented this junk, and anyone else in the company that green-lighted it for sale, should be horse whipped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is one of my rare exceptions.  So why am I do ing this?  Last April I developed a blood clot in my right calf as well as a small one just above my knee.  As is usual in these cases, I was placed on the anticoagulation medicine Warfarin (the generic form of Coumadin) for six months.  This past saturday I was officially taken off Warfarin.Why do I bring all this up?  I was told in April that I was going to have to be very careful not to cut myself shaving.  If I did, I might have a great deal of trouble stopping the bleeding.  I had bought this razor literally the week before my blood clot.  I had been using the Mach 3 before this and often cut myself using it.  I was somewhat dubious about using this new razor and its five blade, but I liked the very, very close shave it gave me.  So I stuck with it.  The result?  In six months I did not cut myself a single time.  This is far and away the best razor I\'ve ever used.  It gives an amazingly close shave and protects my skin from scraping or cutting better than anything I\'ve ever used.So thanks Gillette for not making me find out what cutting myself when shaving would have been like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She normally uses a men\'s Gillette Mach 3 since the blades last a long time and the smaller head is easy to use.She liked the Venus Embrace and found it to be a very comfortable razor.  The blades lasted a long time (at least 5-6 shaves doing legs and under arms).  She felt the \'lubricating strips\' at the top of the razor would allow touchups without using shaving foam, but that soap or foam were still necessary if you don\'t shave each day or have heavier hair.The head is somewhat wider than with men\'s razors, but easy to use and reach more difficult spots.All in all, she was very satisfied with the Venus Embrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve been a happy Gillette Fusion Power user for years so incorporating the razor into a trimmer, with good looks and Gillette quality was a no-brainer for giving it a spin. Well I just used this tonight (trim and shave) and it works great for both. I\'m totally happy with it and for under $20 for a top tier razor and trimmer, with a great design (especially coming right out of the gate with this brand new product), you can\'t go wrong. Highly recommended. I paid about $18.74 at Walmart and they\'re sold out now. People know and love Gillette!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These work fine but I need to replace more often because the skin guard reduces the friction.  overall a good blade and the price is right but not quite as comfortable as the Excel.

I have sensitive skin and I\'m always complaining about not getting a close enough shave without tearing my face up, so when I saw the commercial for Proglide I decided to give it a go.  It\'s sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.  I\'ll say this, it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  When I\'ve waited a few days before using, the Proglide is a dream.  It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  Sadly, I\'ve noticed that if I shave two days in a row my skin gets irritated and the shave is nowhere near as close.  I know that some consider the battery operated vibration to be a mere gimmick, but having used a razor with the same capability for years I have found that my shave is always closer WITH the vibration, and I\'m quick to replace the battery because of that.  Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it\'s worth it (as far as I\'m concerned).  When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.  All in all, I like this product.  It delivers most of the time; I just wish it were always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

351,360,20080313,B000277P5E,2,"March 13, 2008",A2QMXIFIVE4LNS,"Cheaply made, mediocre, and overpriced.","Mediocre and Overpriced, March 13, 2008By  supernatural (Illinois) - See all my reviewsUnfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems. It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5756,2058,20100716,B003987CL0,2,"July 16, 2010",A20VXYT5DL0ZC6,"Cartridge razors: A waste of money, and an inferior shave","I used Gillette cartridge shavers for years; Sensor Excel, Mach 3, the 4-blade system (forgot the name), and Fusion Power. Probably spent thousands of dollars on these contraptions, and for what??--as I\'ve learned, the shave you get from the cartridge razors is simply not as good as old-fashioned straight razor and safety razor shaves. If you don\'t take yourself seriously as a man and as a connoisseur, than by all means, stick with cartridge razors and waste money to boot. But if you value the lofty experience, the pinnacle of manly class and style, try out traditional shaving.I switched to a safety razor rather than move up to the Proglide. I\'m glad I did.The best shave you can get, of course, is from a professional barber with a profesionally-maintained straight razor. But that\'s an occasional treat, unless you have the time to go to your barbershop every morning and afternoon for shaves (I hope that tradition makes a comeback, though). Maintaining a straight razor at home is time-consuming. And you have to treat shaving with more care and caution, lest you bloody your shower as in a scary horror flick. The good medium compromise is the famous safety razor, which is making a comeback these days. You buy a safety razor handle, made of heavy metal, usually stainless steel. It feels good, heavy, solid in your hand. You buy an inexpensive supply of safety razor blades. Easy to replace, they last about 1-2 weeks per double-sided blade, dependng on beard thickness. Standard safety blades will do you fine, and they\'re much, much less expensive than constantly buying cartridges which clog and wear out quickly (if you want the best safety razor blades, [...] ([...]) has cryo-treated safety blades that last five times as long as regular safety blades, so you save even more money).Then, you buy several shaving soaps and soap dishes, for variety if you like, which are better for your skin than mass-market aerosol shaving gels. The mass-market stuff is junk. Traditional shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful. The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave. I keep five different soaps in my shower in separate bowls so i can switch depending on my mood for scents. You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man\'s lifestyle.Simply put, safety razors and straight razors give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price. And btw, a quality aftershave treatment will also be very good for your skin, it does make a difference. Due to the greater time-consumption of maintaining a straight razor, I suggest trying a safety razor outfit first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I like the thicker handle of my old razor better.  The thingy that sticks to the shower wall is great!  It was really handy and never fell off, even in a hot shower.  Overall, the shave was fine, but not stellar.\'So, to summarize, it sounds like the blades themselves are good and do a good job on the skin (no irritations), but the handle might bother some people.  The grip matters the most when moving it against the body, so keep that in mind.I like the way my wife\'s legs felt after she used it, so I cannot complain.

I switched to a safety razor for facial shaving more years ago than I care to remember and I have yet to find a disposable or replaceable or for that matter rechargeable (and I have tried quite a few) that comes anywhere close to equaling the resultant closeness of cut or smoothness particularly when those infuriating independent gray hairs that crop up under the chin are considered. However, I am not as adept in avoiding a sling blade result on the back of my head with a safety razor so I am constantly in the market to identify a disposable or replaceable that fills the bill.To that end, the ProGlide is acceptable but I still had to make several passes on the back of my head to get a smooth, minimally stubby result, not unlike the outcomes with a Mach 3 or Schick 3... or one of the five rechargeables currently residing in one bathroom or another. Interesting enough, I also got better results on my head with the back side trimmer single blade than the front side five blade shredder.  I didn\'t feel any discomfort like pulling or tugging or experience any inadvertent nicks. Actually, I was mildly surprised that it had cut as close as it did since it felt like it was not cutting at all which I suppose is somewhat of an endorsement.However, with the ongoing cost of replacement cartridges, for my needs there are far too many less expensive, equally beneficial alternatives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6371,2682,20120128,B004B8F8MM,5,"January 28, 2012",A1D3XIXEHNZRY0,EXACT same product from the store...just cheaper and easier to open.,"There have been a few reviews suggesting that these razors are not genuine because they were \'repackaged.\'Others have suggested these don\'t last as long as those great razors from Target.Here\'s the real story:The packaging you get in the department store is designed to be attractive and very hard to open.  Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren\'t secured in their package.  Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  And since you\'ve already bought the item, there is no need for overly attractive packaging either.  The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can\'t re-use the packaging from the store).As far as longevity, I\'m probably about as tough of a test case as you can imagine.  I\'ve got thick, stubborn hairs on my next that lay sideways and reverse direction in certain spots.  Every time I shave these razors get a good workout.  When a razor is too worn, it is a painful experience and leads to immense amounts of irritation.  Needless to say, I notice pretty quickly when these get dull, and the razors from Gillette through Amazon take just as long to dull as do the razors from Gillette through the grocery store...this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.  This is the exact same product.  And, if you will still be shaving in a few months, do yourself a favor an subscribe for additional savings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All types of mach 3\'s produce an equal shave which is at the same time, close and the blades clean out well under a hot tap. but the overriding factor that made me come back to them was the 7 variaties of handle to choose from, so now i can have a different razor for every day of the week which overall makes shaving everyday more tolerable. i dont personally believe in the micro-pulses of the m3 power but the vibrations themselves must enhance the the performance somehow. if your thinking of buying one of the mach 3\'s then go for it, as you won\'t be dissapointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(I did not turn on the vibration on the Vibrance, because I have never found it to make any difference and because I felt it might skew the experiment.) I put a new blade on the Vibrance, so that both razors were starting out on as level a playing field as possible.There was very little noticeable difference in performance. Both razors shaved my legs smoothly. The only drawback to the Embrace is that it has a slightly larger head, which makes it a little difficult to maneuver around knees and other tricky areas. I saw no difference in closeness of shave between the three and the five-bladed razors; and a few days later, I saw no difference in the amount of stubble.Overall, I\'d say that if you are a first-time Venus buyer, the Embrace is a fine choice; but if you already have a Venus razor, the Embrace really isn\'t an upgrade, and there\'s no reason to buy it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am not super harry but I am not exactly a peach either.  At this point I can\'t see any reason to go to another razor.

4027,1403,20090416,B001F51QJ8,4,"April 16, 2009",AWPN47SSWK1JV,Good Product,Goes on nice and smooth and leaves your skin feeling soft and silky. The scent is so light as to be almost nonexistent so it would probably work well for people with allergies. It does do a good job of controlling wetness and odor but in my opinion is just a little to expensive hence the four stars instead of five.  Also if you\'re having problems with wetness when applying the product that just means that you\'re using to much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5794,2096,20100610,B003987CL0,5,"June 10, 2010",A2H2I5FY1PUHP1,Five Stars From a Life Long Shick User,"To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.I\'ll begin by saying that I\'ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.ProGlide vs. Hydro 5Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.What\'s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette\'s as a travel holder with no problem.Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro\'s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as \'suspension\' for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.On initial \'hefting\' the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.The Shave TestAll of the above are secondary to the \'Yes, But How Does It Shave\' test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream and a badger bristle brush.Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \'razor burn\' marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \'dried\' she still said the Gillette side was smoother.Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.ProGlide vs QuattroShave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.So what\'s not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn\'t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1851,754,20060127,B000BUW8WM,5,"January 27, 2006",A3STE4OXD66ZFI,Fusion Power is The Best Razor Yet!,"I bought the New Fusion Power Razor on January 26th at CVS. I\'ve been shaving with it almost everyday starting January 27th. It is a totally new shaving experience! The razor glides over your face easier than any razor I\'ve ever used, and there is less...almost no...irritation. The time it takes me to shave has not been significantly reduced, but it has helped some and I do like the less irritation that it provides.I\'ve found the new razor lasts me 5 to 7 days of shaving before it wears out. However, the blue strip does wear out after about 4 days, but I continue to use it for a few more. I had used the Mach 3 Power razor for several years and the new Fusion Power is the best shave yet. I had similar results with the Mach 3 blades lasting about 5 to 7 shaves.I usually let me face have a rest on the weekend from all the shaving during the week, and I haven\'t stopped that tradition. For the past two weekends I skipped a day and shaved on Sunday or Monday morning.The razor has had no problems shaving through two days of growth. I have thick stubble by day two and the shave is as good as ever. The razor doesn\'t get clogged and can be cleaned out easily.I\'m getting use to the new precision trimmer on the back of the razor to shave under my nose and side-burns. I\'m more impressed with the results than I was on day one, but not as I am with my old Sensor razor, which is what I still find myself using for those hard-to-reach areas.I\'ve been using Gillette products for 17 years. I started with the Sensor and have bought and used every razor Gillette has made since! I have \'em all!The price is high, I\'ll admit it! But I think I\'m going to stick with the New Power Fusion for now. I still have some of the Mach 3 Power blades I need to use so once those are gone, I\'ll be strictly using the Fusion Power Razor.One other thing to consider is the kind of shaving cream or gel you use. I\'ve noticed that the better, \'more expensive\' ones provide a better feeling during and after a shave. I currently use Gillette\'s Shaving Gel, but I want to try the new Fusion Hydra Gel. I also want to try the King of Shaves gel. I\'ve also found the Neturogena razor defense post shave lotion to be a great product!Ultimately, the razor looks good and feels good in your hand. The shave is great and I\'m hooked!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

The blade guards are far too short to trim anything other than maybe your kids pet hamster.The longest blade guide isn\'t even the shortest guide on my beard,and mustache trimmer...So as an average man with real facial hair,it\'s useless.I understand it\'s not really for \'beards\' but I\'m struggling for what good guides this short are for.It\'s not going to replace my beard & mustache trimmer (even in a pinch),and I can\'t see it really being good for small jobs,that I\'d rather use my beard & mustache trimmer for anyway...UselessI also didn\'t like the idea,of all my shaving gel,facial hair I\'ve shaved off on the trimmer blades.When I rinsed my shaving head off,the trimmer blades are pretty exposed to all that muck.The idea is good,but not for men..It just failed all around as a shaver trimmer,that I was looking for,I wouldn\'t waste my money on this (I regret that I did),unless you really are into manscaping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It looks a little scary coming out the tube with its tiny beads but it goes on smoothly and you just have to make sure you rub it in your arm pit completely so it doesnt stain up your clothes.It is suggested that you apply the deodorant at night before you sleep and that makes it more effective since it works with your body to block the pores.  It says it works just as well even if you shower in the morning and do not reapply since it works over night to block pores.I haven\'t tried that since I shower every morning and would rather apply it before i walk out the door.  Its more a preference for me.I would say so far so good.  The big test will come in the summer when I have a long sleeve shirt on in the heat here in Philly.  I will update post then.I recommend the product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6507,2822,20120211,B0062IWQVU,5,"February 11, 2012",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,Trimmer alone is worth the cost,"Very impressed with this latest offering from Gillette. It has a nice weight to it -- definitely doesn\'t feel cheap -- and is grippy to hold, though the razor has quite a bit of bulk to it when using the Fusion ProGlide attachment. Not something to stop me from using it, but it\'ll take a little adjustment over the \'finesse\' I had with a regular Fusion handle. The trimmer is really where this thing shines. The Braun-branded trimmer is quite powerful and is perfect for shaping up my facial hair. I use it for sideburns and to keep a unibrow at bay. Gets the job done very nicely. Nothing to plug in, it runs off a single battery and the included stand is very space-saving.If you\'re already a Fusion user, this is a nice upgrade. If not, consider it just for the trimmer. I\'m happy with how much counter space I\'ve reclaimed and that all my face care appliances are now in one convenient package.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I figured this would be a big step up in my shower shaving world.Well, not so much, it turns out. The moisture rich gel bars on the top and bottom of the shaving blades were big, though they moved out of the way easily they still sat extended while shaving. I didn\'t feel as smooth as usual, but a little \'patchy\'.Thankfully the shaving gel wasn\'t irritating, and it rinsed very easily, but I wasn\'t impressed. It just didn\'t leave me feeling like my leg was any more moisturized than when I stepped in. Plus, the bars are gooey... like drool. It will definitely melt away sooner than the when the blades would be unusable.For the price, I\'ll stick with my cheap, yet close shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6073,2381,20101219,B003M6WYW6,5,"December 19, 2010",AHLP9D7L49ROY,A real cooling sensation!,I have been using the Gillette fusion after shave for a long time (the orange bottle). I ordered a 2 pack of this to give it a try. MUCH better than the orange stuff. It feels like regular lotion when you put it on but after a few seconds you can really feel the cooling effect kick in. It feels great after a shave and really soothes my skin. The cooling effect works really well and I think feels great on your skin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve been using the Trac II since I started shaving, about 30 or so years ago. I\'ve used every other razor there is--and there are other razors that do shave a little closer--but not for the cost of the Trac II. That\'s why it still exists after 40 years.I\'ve also tried imitations of the TracII (Personna, Walgreens, etc.), but none measure up. They tend to pull more and are not as smooth.

It is virtually fragrance free, goes on very smooth, feels light and silky, and disappears into a clear layer that doesn\'t mark your clothes. It keeps you absolutely dry and odor free all day. While the label says to apply the night before, I always forget, but it works perfectly anyway. I\'ve used Mitchem antiperspirants for over 20 years. This is the first product that works just as well. It is a powdery cream that actually feels softer and smoother going on than any other product I\'ve tried, probably due to the multitude of tiny openings in the metered delivery system and the very wide application platform. The instructions say to use 3 clicks, but I use more - hardly any comes out in those tiny clicks!Depending on price and availability, I just might keep using this for awhile instead of Mitchem for no other reason than the very smooth and soft feel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ll say they have almost identical results and the price is better per blade.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

In terms of how it smells, I give it 5 stars.But it\'s costly, and about 3/4th the size of a regular stick of anti-persperant deodorant. I found one at CVS for about $10.It says 2-clicks worth is all you need, so I\'ll see how long it lasts. 2-clicks didn\'t produce much of the anti-persperant. So I have high hopes.But unless the price comes down or they increase the size, I can\'t give it a full 5 stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has all the benefits of the Venus line (the flexibility, the multiple blades) with a wonderfully impressive moisturizing bar that gets shaving done all in one go.It really works!  It makes shaving easy as there is nothing in the way to hide the skin.  The bars make a great yet mild foam and also do the bonus job of keeping the blades a safe distance from the skin--excellent protection.I had a great shave with this with less stress than I have ever had.

5720,2022,20101017,B003983I1S,3,"October 17, 2010",AIO1YA5THH0H1,"Not bad; an improvement in some ways, but not  others.","First up, my history. When I first started shaving, I used a disposable manual razor. Twice. After that, realizing shaving wasn\'t something one could usually get out of by choice, I bought an electric razor, of the rotary type. When the Gillette Mach 3 was introduced, I got that to keep for a backup, or for a closer shave for important events, concerts, shows, etc. Eventually I upgraded my rotary razor to a Braun Pulsonic (expensive) razor. Soon after, I tried the Gillette Fusion Power, to see how it compared. Lets just say it compared just enough to be actually worth comparing. This again went into the cabinet as a special occasional razor. About three months ago, as the cartridge in my Braun Pulsonic was aging beyond it\'s recommended life cycle and the shave was getting less close, and more painful, I decided to try the Gillette Proglides cartridges. I used them on my Gillette Fusion Power handle, since it\'s basically the same as the Proglide handle.Here was my experience with not one but four separate cartridges:I decided to shave at roughly the same time every day, just to get a real good idea of how it performed in relation to my electric. I also shaved the day prior, with my electric.The very first shave was very smooth and close, with no tug and pull, just as advertised. I was surprised, but pleased. It did tend to nick up my face pretty bad, but the blades were sharp enough so it didn\'t affect comfort. I shave well in advance of leaving home, so this wouldn\'t have been a big deal. The second and subsequent shaves were dramatically different from the first one. All were painful, rough, uneven, and frankly not all that close. I was close to just heading back to the Pulsonic with two year (plus) old cartridge, but I decided to stick it out. As the strip of lubricant wore down significantly, the comfort of the shave improved. It wasn\'t as close, but it was almost, if not as comfortable as the first. This lasted until the strip was nearly gone, and it was clearly time to replace.I decided at that point to return to my Pulsonic, and just buy the new cartridge, as it had served me well for two years on one cartridge.A few weeks later, I had an interview, so I bought a three cartridge set of the Proglide cartridges. I decided that after I used the one for the interview, I would use the other two to do a slightly different test.With the final two cartridges, I decided to wait varying periods of time between shaves, so the stubble would be a different length each time.Overall, the results were the same as the first time, with a few differences. Any shave of stubble that was between two days and five days old was much more comfortable and close than it would have been at the same point in the cartridge life cycle with shorter stubble. The longest stubble, which was about six days growth, resulted in a shave that was less close, but as comfortable as the other longer-stubble shaves.I don\'t know whether my rate of stubble growth is typical or atypical, but I can grow a nice goatee in about a week.Overall, I think that Gillette is going in the right direction, but they need to strike a finer balance between shave quality, and longevity of blades in order to make these worthwhile.After all the hype (which I tried to ignore, but who can, really?) I was expecting something different, and much improved. Frankly, even the few times when I turn to a manual razor, I would probably turn to the old Fusion, just because I didn\'t have as many guessing games. It worked until it stopped, which was just before the color from the strip was gone. Even for someone who shaves primarily with a manual razor, unless they have money to blow, I wouldn\'t recommend the Proglide.Overall, my opinion is that this is a debatable improvement over the previous generation, and that it was so far over-hyped that it created false expectations. Had it not been hyped so much as a dramatic improvement, I might have given it four stars, but that type of advertising really irks me.NOTE: This was my experience with the product, and since this sort of product depends a lot on individual faces, hair, shaving habits, etc., it\'s not good to draw a conclusion based solely on a few other reviews. In addition, different people expect different things from a razor. I prefer a balance of longevity, comfort and closeness, while others prefer one over the others. My opinion is: if you\'re an owner of a Fusion handle, you can always get a small pack of the Proglide cartridges and try them out. They may well work differently for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this deodorant.  The smell is very nice, rivals Axe in my opinion, it lasts for the better part of the day and using it now in the summer time gives me a good appreciation for its ability to keep off my t-shirts, for the most part.  The only downside is the price, also comparable to Axe products.  But, I have grown attached to this deodorant and will be ordering more in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, for a military family on a tight budget, the blades are too expensive to replace as often as necessary. He\'s lucky to get two uses out of each blade. So.... great razor, but not quite good enough to justify the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know that Gillette has made great razors in the past so I bought it.  The design, I would give it 5 stars however, the single blade trimmer is not all that effective and like many of the reviews above it is very difficult to clean.  The five blades however did not run as smoothly across my face.  Yes it gave me an incredibly close shave the first couple of tries but on the third day i felt that I was sawing at my face and having to do multiple strokes in areas just to cut the whiskers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The blades were much sharper than the regular Fusion blades and gave him a very smooth shave without cutting himself at all.  In fact he said it seems like it would be next to impossible to cut yourself.  We couldn\'t quite figure out why you\'d want a battery operated razor, but he said he was surprised to find that it really made a difference.  I really can\'t see any movement of the razor when I look at it turned on, but he said he liked it a lot.  The razor itself has nice rubberized grips which help make sure it doesn\'t slip out of your hands. My husband already uses the regular Fusion blades and tested them out and they fit on the Proglide razor just fine.  He\'ll probably go back and forth between the two different blades depending on what we have coupons for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used to use a regular razor with shaving cream, but I always thought it was a pain. I would lift my leg up onto the built in shower seat but the water would wash away the shaving cream every time. Then my friend got me hooked onto The Venus Breeze built in soap razor. Now, shaving my legs is literally a breeze!!! It\'s a lot easier to do in a time in need. I can even shave legs and underarms when I need too. Like before a trip to the beach in the summer or a school concert.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

I have been using Fusion Blades since they have been on the market and my face told me with the first stroke that the blades were counterfeit.  A convenience store cheapo throw-away blade is a lot sharper.  A few years ago I was given a web page that I could buy this type blade at a discount price.  They too were counterfeit.  I realise that you have to be skeptical when buying on the internet, but I trusted Amazon to have checked their vendors out.  What is most aggravating is there was no deal in the price. I could have went to the nearest Walmart and bought for the same price when adding the cost of fuel for the round trip.......",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could.

6278,2588,20070130,B004B8AZH0,2,"January 30, 2007",A139ZF7CJVVTJU,Sometimes Less Is More,"Razor blades are expensive enough as it is, and the trend of \'more is better\' has reached almost ludicrous points in the industry.  What\'s that?  Five blades, you say?  Why, it must be better than four!  Meh.I have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck.  The good news is that, while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the problem.  In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades).  The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area).  If you have sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you.Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra \'trimming\' blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.However, the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast.  Considering my rather fine hairs, I\'m used to exchanging blades once every week or so.  Now I\'m exchanging them twice a week.  Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors\' products, and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

1900,806,20070113,B000BUW8WM,1,"January 13, 2007",A1KY1EM93SYZVE,Crappy razor.,This razor is actually the most uncomfortable I\'ve ever used. It seems much harder to shave with and pulls at my face more. This is coming from someone who loves the mach 3 in its various forms. I\'m not sure what the problem is. Maybe the blades are too close to each other or something. Maybe trying to cut so many hairs at once is a bad idea. All I know for sure is it\'s not smooth.  It\'s not just a slight difference either. I go back to the mach 3 which I still have and I immediately notice the difference. Maybe others with different beards will have better luck but for me this razor down right sucks. I\'ve given it a fair shake too. I\'m still trying to use up the blades I stupidly bought.  However I can\'t ignore the fact it is far worse.Edit: I want to add one more thing. Whey you first put a new cartage in the razor does a pretty good job. If you tested it for one shave you might think it was good. However it really degrades very quickly. The second day it\'s noticeably worse and it just goes down hill fast after that. Again I am comparing this to a Mach 3 which I can keep for a much (and I mean MUCH) longer time and have it shave pretty good.  There is definitely some technical problem with this razor and I think a lot of people posting good results have a) tested it once b) are shills for Gillette c)  are in denial after spending a lot of cash on it or d) have a beard like a baby\'s butt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My husband used this deodorant and found the smell not unpleasant, but a little bit stronger than his usual (he normally uses Mennen Speed Stick). It did not leave any streaks or staining on the shirt and lasted him the day. Though the Amazon Title given this product says \'Deodorant\' the item itself is labeled as an Antiperspirant/Deodorant and it does its job fairly well under normal \'office\' circumstances.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

4000,1376,20090618,B001F51QJ8,4,"June 18, 2009",A26R7LLAFTPC3U,Not perfect--But darn close,"I perspire quite a bit but generally gravitate towards the inexpensive/sale deodorants.  Since that generally means I use different deodorants, I\'ve also found that I am fairly sensitive too--some deodorants (that don\'t brag about being strong) will irritate my under-arms.  That\'s not a good combo--to be blessed with genes that make me perspire more than average, yet be sensitive to many deodorants.So, enter this Gillette Clinical Strength.  I had both very high hopes (that it would solve my odor issues), yet was a bit worried that, especially since I had never used anything Clinical Strength before, that it would surely irritate me in some way.To my surprise, everything seemed great.  It\'s basically odorless, goes on smoothly and doesn\'t leave any residue.  Thankfully, no irritation whatsoever, to my surprise.  On a day to day basis, it covers me all day long with no odor (which is way above and beyond many deodorants I\'ve tried).The ONLY reason it didn\'t get all five stars is because I can occasionally tell that it didn\'t fully cover me; but only when I\'ve been doing a decent amount of physical work or been in the heat.  Perhaps I\'m asking too much, but for me, the perfect five star deodorant would be able to get me through a 24-hour period even if I did a decent amount of physical activity.Even though I\'m a very frugal person, and although I was \'manly\' enough to occasionally break through this deodorant, I will certainly pay a premium for this deodorant in the future, as it works better than all the other many brands I\'ve used.  Good job, Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I laughed when I heard Gillette was coming out with a razor with 5 blades but it didn\'t surprise me. This is the best shave I have ever had. The 5 blades glide across the face without friction or burn and the shave feels effortless.  The 6th single blade is gimmicky but good for what it is for...under the nose and sideburns.  I cringed when I saw the cost of replacement blades but buy your blades on EBAY and save lots of money.

Every once in awhile I get a coupon or a large discount from another brand and give it a go because I hate being tied to one brand. The problem is, other razors are really unpleasant and I wind up with cuts. I won\'t go into specifics as to which those brands are, but let\'s just say I am not going to try them again anytime soon. I actually prefer the Original blade mover all the others, but the Divine came up on sale, and I found out I don\'t mind tham at all. Unlike the Breeze which has these really big gel bars which I found to be unpleasant and uncomfortable once the gel bars were gone, these little moisture strips are not so strong or slimy to cause much notice. I bought them because of price over the original and found them to be an excellent substitute. I would buy them again in heartbeat if the price was right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I dont know why I am the only one commenting on it, but I seem to break the connection between the body and the head 40% of the time before I need to replace the head.I have broken it by both banging the body against the side of the sink to clear out the hair, by dropping the razor into the sink, and by packing it in an shave kit and traveling with it.This is a very delicate razor that is very expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One time is all you need with this and your face will feel like a babys bottom. No missed spots, and it didnt snag on my hair even a bit.

I\'m not looking for a religious experience when I shave - just smooth skin without irritation, nicks or cuts.  The Proglide gives a good but not superior result, and Gillette\'s instructions for an optimal shave require too much prep time.  Also, Gillette hints that the razor may dull after 5 shaves.  It does and the \'special lubricating strip\' wears out sooner.  Frequent razor replacement in addition to the cost of a better quality shave cream is ridiculously expensive.  I\'ll continue to use the Braun (which has a surprisingly good shave block) for daily shaving, and save the Proglide for trimming my sideburns and neckline where it excels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Get what you pay for I guess.If you want the best, smoothest shave on planet earth with minimum irritation and you don\'t want to spend more time in the bathroom tending to your face than your wife? Then this is your razor.If you want to shave with a piece of flint, save a few bucks and thumb your nose at the system? Not my problem. Will lesser razors shave your face? Yep, especially if you like nicks, cuts, razor burn, multiple passes, shaving against the grain, re-shaving, $20 shaving creams, $80 shave brushes, pre-shave oils, soothing aftershaves, witch hazel, styptic sticks, hanging out on internet forums wondering what you\'re doing wrong, etc... And if you can find the economy in that, let me know.Did I mention this razors performance in more private areas? Nothing even comes close. And electric personal groomers are poor in performance by comparison.As for the cost, for me this is a non-issue. I can get months out of one cartridge relatively easily and with a little common sense that seems abundant out here in the woods, less so in the city. Therefore, this and other razors of its type (Mach 3 innovation) are no more expensive to me than a \'classic\' double edged razor which I have as well. It stays in the drawer mostly. But easily accessible if I suddenly need to go back in time, or remember why at one time why most men grew beards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.)

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

1827,730,20060222,B000BUW8WM,4,"February 22, 2006",A3M5SH898GPMWW,Gillette Fusion Power has pluses and minus over Mach 3 Power,"I have a thick beard. I shave daily. I have been using Gillette sensor-series products almost exclusively since the Gillette sensor debuted in 1990.I graduated from Sensor, To Sensor II, to Mach 3, to Mach 3 power.I normally shave wet, with no shaving cream, and with down strokes, although I use some upstrokes. I have tested the Mach 5 both wet and dry, with no cuts or major problems.I have used the Gillette Fusion for 1 week, and here are my findings.Pluses:1) An overall great shave.2) The Fusion shaves better dry than any previous Sensor model. (Although I rarely have a reason to shave dry).3) More blades. More microfins!4) The plastic handle, while bulky, is very nice. The plastic is gentle to the touch, aa nice departure from the rigid, cold metal of the M3.5) Comes with a coupon for $2 off additional cartridges.Minuses:1) The confort strip wear out WAY too quickly.  My Mach3 blades last 3 weeks, My Fusion blade needs replacement after 1 week. Hopefully, the replacement blades will be better than the original ones (if so, I\'ll edit this review).2) Since there are more microfins with a larger area, and sincen the microfins become more imporant to the overall shave, the microfins trap more hairs than ever. Even washing the blade doesn\'t get rid of all of the microhairs trapped in the microfins.3) The 5 blades make upstrokes more difficult and don\'t offer the precision of the M3 and previous models for the tough spots (e.g. under the nose). On the soft ares of the face (e.g., the cheecks), the larger footprint makes it harder to press close and cut hairs close to the skin. However, this problem is somewhat offset by the additional blades and microfins.4) As always, the blades are more expensive than previous version. At this rate of inflation, Gillette blades will cost $50 each by the year 2030. =)Overall, it is a great product. I am undecided if I will keep using Fusion or switch back to the M3 as my primary. I might use both together (as I previously did with the M3 and Sensor Excel).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some have been better than others - but they have all shared one important flaw.  The best of them (they go on clear and seem \'invisible\' and do both the deodorant and anti-perspiration functions well) tend to not be so invisible when they come in contact with dark colored clothing - especially the black tee shirts that I am personally fond of wearing.I am delighted to report that this product, the Gillette Clear Shield Arctic Ice, broke that mold!Not only does it go on clear and smoothly, inhibit perspiration and eliminate the associated odor, but it actually does not create white residue and stains on my black tees!I really did not expect it to work as many other products over the years have made claims in that direction.  This one actually works. Your dark clothing will thank you for it.Give it a try - I don\'t think you will be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time, the price was about $18 or so and I thought that was a great deal since these razors usually retail much higher.The razors showed up and I noticed a number of particular differences between my used old blades (bought from a supermarket). First the blade seemed a bit dull and dry when I shaved using the first blade in the package. It was so bad I had to throw it out immediately and tried the second..And then a third blade, etc..Needless to say ALL the blades were terrible..ALL THE BLADES! I found it strange that out of 16 blades, I wasn\'t even able to get one good shave and had to go buy the blades at full retail cost in person at a supermarket, and use my old turbo blade in the meantime. Another thing I noticed was the blue strip seemed to be made out of plastic and was not lubricating.Today is July 18, 2010 and I was thinking of buying some blades since I ran out and the price seems pretty reasonable...But then I noticed many reviews here with zero stars and talk of fakes.. Looks like I wasn\'t the only one.I am not sure where these reviewers bought their blades from (Marketplace or directly from Amazon) but I can say this:I bought my blades directly from Amazon, its a verified purchase and after reading the reviews here I think they sold me fakes.Thanks Amazon..Check your suppliers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn\'t any better.So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.- Now, here\'s the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same.

The blade is comparable to a high end disposable blade and does not cut at about 10% the effectiveness of the in store Mach 3 blades. I have not had one good shave since buying these. Originally I thought my first blade was simply just defective, but that is the case for all the blades in the package as I have tried 7 of them and they are only good for one below average shave.Never again will I buy these from Amazon. I will explore return options, but I wanted to ensure the rest of the general public does not waste their money or fall for this scam.

We still have a bunch of blades for it though, so do I buy another one so she can finish using the blades, or do we buy a different razor that won\'t just break after a few weeks.  So I do not recommend this purchase unless you feel like being trapped in a similar situation where you have blades but no handle for them to go on.  Extremely poor design.  You would think that a company that specializes in making razors would make a good one, but no. Is it possible they want you to be caught in this trap, I think so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course, I also hated the 5 o\'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It\'s worth the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rectal thermometer read 103.1, 102.4, and 101.9 when taken three consecutive times. Right out of the package the Braun ear thermometer read 101.6, 101.6, 101.5, 101.5. I took mine and it read as 98.8, 98.5, 98.5. MUCH better than my old thermometer and it took a fraction of the time. Not to mention it\'s much easier to get than a rectal temp, and I look forward to seeing just how easy that will be when we need to use it in the middle of the night!No, the screen doesn\'t light up for night time use.

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

6030,2338,20110901,B003EMVVMM,4,"September 1, 2011",AO10CSBMJ0F8U,"Very good razors, but expensive and they don\'t last long - would give it 3.5 stars","I\'d give this 3.5 stars if I could.  I previously used the Mach 3 and the Mach 3 Turbo but I got constant nicks, cuts and burns.  I found these rarely give the nicks and cuts other razors have, but there are some drawbacks that go along with it.  They are VERY expensive.  No matter where you look (Amazon, CVS, etc..), they\'re just pricey.  I wouldn\'t mind it so much except for the fact that one razor doesn\'t last very long.  One razor gives me about 6-7 shaves before it starts scratching and cutting me.  I don\'t know but I just feel they should last longer at this price.  It kind of reminds of \'the printer ink price scam\'.  You know, like when HP sells a great printer for $75 but charges $20 for a single ink cartridge.  Well, the shaver itself is cheap but these blades cost a bundle.But I will say, I definitely get less cuts so that\'s why I continue to buy them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1830,733,20060212,B000BUW8WM,2,"February 12, 2006",A17SEG3RJJ8O8S,"Overhyped, Overrated","The way some reviewers are raving about this razor really makes me question their integrity. There is absolutely no way this is a 4- or 5-star product. I call shill.I\'ll start with the few good things about the razor:1. It feels very nice in hand. The \'grippies\' are in just the right place. It has a nice heft with the battery in. The size and shape fit the hand nicely.2. It looks very cool. I really like the orange and grey/silver meme that has been going through design the past few years. If anyone watches you shave, they will be impressed seeing you with this. However, I, for one, typically shave alone so this isn\'t worth much.3. The battery level indicator is very cool and effective. It\'s hard to describe, but I wish everything I own that uses batteries had this indicator.4. The single blade on the back of the razor is brilliant. It\'s not as effective as I\'d like, but it is much better at keeping a sharp sideburn line than the five blades. I suspect the angle/ position will be worked out in the future.Now the bad:1. It doesn\'t shave any better than any other razor I\'ve ever used. Yeah, it gives a pretty close shave. But my tried and true Sensor Excel blades, the handle of which I purchased in 1996, give just as close of a shave without any of the other problems listed below.2. It\'s very expensive. $30 for 8 cartridges?! Ridiculous. Absolutely not worth it. The Sensor Excel 8 pack is literally half the price - still more than I think they are worth - but gives a better shave.3. I\'ve never had a more uncomfortable shave. The blades catch my stubble, making for a very slow shave. Yes, of course, shaving with the \'grain\' of your beard reduces this problem but it still happens. Most people have swirling grain somewhere on their face. This razor makes shaving those areas very difficult and slow going.4. The blades have a short lifespan. I am only able to get 3-4 shaves out of a head before the stubble-catching problem gets so bad I can\'t use it. By contrast, my Sensor Excel blades easily last 7-8 shaves - about two weeks, though by the 7th or 8th shave it is catching pretty bad too. My straight edge doesn\'t have this problem at all, given a quick run over the strop before each shave.The overall experience is expensive and uncomfortable and results in a mediocre shave. It is a disappointing product and not worth the investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each one was better than the previous one. However when they started with the 3 and 5 blades I said \'enough already\'.  I finally tried them as samples, but drew the line at the vibrating one.  The Sensor Excel is really the best. The problem is it got so expensive, in a large part because the 5 blade razors were hugely expensive and Gillette/P&G couldn\'t have an old product that worked so well so much cheaper.  At least with Amazon\'s auto ship it makes the blades reasonable.  Perhaps the crowd at P&G are responsible for these ridiculous new models out now with 6 blades (5 for the face and 1 for under the nose).

The five-blade Fusion is that good.\'Fact is, you might want to take out some extra insurance on the esophagus. Close means *very* close in this case.The nice thing about an economy that spins out choices like a five-blade razor is that you don\'t *have* to buy it. Gillette\'s earlier products will clean you up just fine, not to mention comparable razors and blades manufactured by the Other Guys.But if you want close to mean \'as close as it currently gets\', you might want to invest in the Fusion (a small investment) and the replacement blades (a large one).I have often suffered an irritated face while shaving with a blade, one of the reasons I moved to a beard and an electric shaver some years ago. But so far, in the thick of the Midwestern winter, I have yet to feel any irritation.The battery-powered, chip-driven gizmo may be overkill, I must admit. I seem to get as good a shave from the Fusion with the power off as with the little hummer humming away.Factor in the cost of the blades. Then, if you still want a shave as close as it gets, the Fusion would be the thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1838,741,20060203,B000BUW8WM,5,"February 3, 2006",A1RQ30E5WA8LU7,As amazing as a razor can be!!,"I picked this up yesterday at Costco (17 bucks for the razor plus 4 cartridges).  I\'ve been a big fan of the M3Power since its release.  I didn\'t buy in to the hype of the Quattro, especially since it\'s a manual razor.  I thought, \'three blades is good enough, what good could four blades do???\'  I only picked up the Fusion because I\'ve never had a bad experience with a Gillette razor...even when I picked up this Fusion, I was a little skeptical about the difference five blades would have over three.  BOY, was I wrong.  It\'s been written in a few other reviews here, but it bears repeating:  This is easily the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had.  Moving with the grain, it doesn\'t even feel like a razor is touching your face.  Even going against the grain, there\'s smooth action and no nicks.the only problem i had was with the head being a little too big to effectively catch the area under your nose.  HOWEVER, there is a single blade on the back of the cartridge for this exact purpose.  I applaud Gillette for the research and customer feedback that went in to the design of this razor.I hate to sound like a commercial, but my wife felt my face after I shaved, and she said that it was the smoothest my face has ever been.  I\'m VERY satisfied with my purchase, and you will be too.  I love this razor (as much as a man is allowed to love a razor.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn\'t any better.So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.- Now, here\'s the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I first opened it, it took me a good 5 minutes to realize that it wasn\'t one of the solid bar deodorants. I had no idea how to use it and it took me quite a while to figure it out. The turning mechanism on the bottom can be frustrating because when you first use it it is difficult to make it work. Another problem is that it is really messy. While applying it you have to keep turning the bottom wheel for more gel to come out which can get annoying. After you are done it really messy and easy to get on your hands, chest, and even the actual container. However it is a very strong and powerful deodorant. It felt great and I could smell it\'s freshness the entire day. Without applying too much even it worked exceptionally well. This is the first time I\'ve ever used a gel deodorant, and I think I might just stick to it. If it\'s possible you should buy an individual one before you get a multi-pack to try out. And this is OVERPRICED! Go to Costco Sams club or BJ\'s and you can get a MUCH cheaper price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

After using the blade wipe it off on a towel and then cover the blade with a few cotton balls held in place by a rubber band. Then put the shaver in your sink drawer. You can easily have 3 weeks of use with this method. The reason why people\'s blades wear out in a week is because they dont dry off the blade and they leave it next to the sink. The moisture causes oxidation and dulling. The price sucks, thats why it gets 4 stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had to do clean up with one of my cheap disposables after using the Sensor!  The one think I liked about Sensor was that they did not get hair stuck in them during usage.  But besides that, they flat out did not work on my face.  I\'m sure millions of other men love them, but not me.

The shaver is smooth on the skin, down\'t cut or nick even in tough spots like behind the knee or in the back of the ankle, and it shaves better and faster. To my surprise, I also found it to be much gentler on the skin, and can be used comfortably without the shaving gel - which is a plus because the gel makes shaving much messier and longer and shortens the life of the blade.Well done to Gillette. Now, if they could only make the packaging a bit more eco-friendly!

The lube strip was virtually gone and I didn\'t get the great shave I had the first time I used it.3 shaves and I can tell a difference.  Are you kidding me?  No my beard isn\'t rough or super thick.  But I\'m not going to swap blades out every 3 or 5 days just for that great feeling of the 1st and 2nd shave.

6037,2345,20110213,B003EMVVMM,4,"February 13, 2011",A1XU7R26EEOHOE,Better than the Fusion Power Blades,"I want to give it a good 1-2 months of use before I wrote a review about them. In short, are these new Fusion Proglide blades better than the previous Fusion Power/Manual blades? YES.The advertised thinner blades do make a difference: these is less drag and effort applied when I shave with my Fusion Power blade handle (you don\'t need to buy the new Fusion Proglide Power shaver to use these new blades). I find the shave to be much more comfortable and enjoyable with these new Proglide blades than with the Fusion Power ones I\'ve been using for the past 2 years.Is there a significant difference between the Proglide Manual and Power cartridges? Not that I can tell and not enough for me to fork over the extra money for them. The battery-powered handle makes the difference in the shave in my opinion.Another reviewer mentioned that blade maintenance makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE in the longevity of your blades, and that is true. Always clean your blades with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol after each shave to remove the mineral deposits left by your sink water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

I\'m glad I did because it worked just as advertised!I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don\'t break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only good news is that I am now seeing the regular fusion blades come down in price slightly.  I will go back to the old ones when this 6 pack is used up.

After signing up for the subscription and purchasing my first order of the razors, I received an email shortly prior to the second month, which I was notified of a price increase. The increase? 38% higher than the original price. So what\'s the deal?? Does Amazon hook people in for automatic purchases for items similar to this that use the Gillette business model? Get them hooked then increase the cost, in hopes that the consumer doesn\'t notice or is too lazy to cancel?? I\'m extremely disappointed and fairly annoyed. This is a bad business practice. If you\'re going to offer a subscription on a product at a set price, then try honoring that price, not an immediate increase of 38% once you have the consumer signed up. Bad...bad business Amazon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6417,2728,20110525,B004QE83VE,4,"May 25, 2011",A30Z0GG96D11EO,Where\'s the hard case??,As always with companies they keep on rolling out new products at a higher price point and less bang for my personal buck.  I personally use the Venus Spa Breeze and loved when it first came out; a few years later and the novelty has worn off.  I find that they are not shaving as well as they used to and the \'bar\' on the actual razor head is not providing any sort of lubrication when it comes to shaving.Now onto the Pro Skin!  These come with a nifty little shower hook that suction cups to my tiled wall rather well.  What happened to the hard snap case that holds the razor in the front and brand new cartridges inside??  This was a big disappointment.  Where am I supposed to store the cartridges?  I hate when I have to separate things because I end up finding unused cartridges of a brand that I am no longer using and disposed of the handle a long time ago (HELLO INTIUTION).  After my initial disappointment and annoyance of that change I vowed to keep an open mind.  The shaving went great!  I found my legs feeling way smoother than they have in a couple of years.  The \'Moisturerich\' head really seems to work.  For me it did not drip or ooze; I think that may be a factor of how much water you are using and how long you are shaving.  My one complaint is that it doesn\'t do as well in the bikini area or around my knees because of the bar; but that is to be expected with this type of shaver.Highly recommend but wish that companies would stop skimping and charging more.  My husband actually commented on the smoothness & suppleness of my legs the very next day when he bumped my calf.  This lead to stroking my whole leg; at the time it didn\'t click that it was actually the Pro Skin razor.  I think I may replace my Spa Breeze with the Pro because at the end of the day I like my legs to feel as if they have been moisturized with lotion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It rolls on like any other deodorant, and smells very pleasant.  Wearing it throughout the day kept me dry and odor-free, doing exactly what it should do.  It rolls on clear and does not run at all which is very comfortable.  Lastly, there was zero residue in my shirt, which is a great advantage to this product.  I would absolutely reccomend this doedorant to people who plan on being active as it seemed to have a very strong drying presence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5920,2227,20120402,B0039LMT9M,5,"April 2, 2012",A3ORJ5IHDMSGS4,Great Razors!,"I haven\'t tried any of the other Gillette Venus products, but I don\'t need to!  My mom bought me a pack of these at a local drugstore MONTHS ago and I\'m still only on my second blade.  During the winter I usually only shave my armpits daily, and since my leg hair doesn\'t grow much in the winter anyway, I only shave them once every week or so.  The small amount of use has probably contributed to keeping the razor clean and sharp.  I leave it in the shower everyday, but I always make sure it stays on a shelf where no water accumulates, so that probably helps too.The moisturizing strip has long since been depleted, but I really don\'t notice a difference in the shave.I usually hold the razor near the bottom and rest my middle finger lightly on top of the actual razor part, because it seems like if I don\'t, it won\'t have enough pressure to get every nook and cranny.  It\'s not really a design flaw; I like it because it gives me a lot more control over the pressure.  The flexible head is AMAZING.  If you\'ve always used cheap one-piece disposables, you are missing out.  I have probably only gotten cut once or twice with this razor (around the ankles--mostly my fault for not being careful enough), when I used to get razor burn and cuts EVERY SHAVE with non-flexible one-piece razors.I strongly suggest you buy these.  This particular package is a great deal at about $3.66/razor (as of 4/2/12).

Razor runs for 5 seconds with flashing light then stops.  Check battery - not down in power but swap for new one - razor runs for 5 seconds with flashing light then stops.  That\'s it - I now have an unpowered fusion with a thicker handle for several $ more.  I doubt I will spend the $ required for more cartridges I can buy a new mach3 and blades for the same price.This is a disposable razor masquerading as a real razor - I wondered why many stores here were not selling the cartridges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'d had a not-so-good experience with the Quattro, so I was a little wary when I discovered this one had even more blades.My experience with the Fusion: It does grab the stubble and take it off slightly better than the M3 Power, but ONLY shaving counter to the direction of the beard growth.  When I shave, I usually mix my strokes up and down, and found that this razor did not remove the beard as well as the M3 Power when shaving on the downstroke.  So I had to restroke my face on certain areas which remained rough after the initial shave, which actually added to my shaving time.  I can only assume the other reviewers who said shaving time was decreased, use only upstrokes when shaving.Second, I was very disappointed when the blue indicator strip disappeared completely right after the first shave.  Refill blades are more expensive than the M3 Power, which usually last me 2 or 3 shaves at least.The last con I have is that the battery button is a bit too sensitive and placed exactly where I like to hold the razor with a firm grip.  Twice while I was shaving I accidentally switched it off.Conclusion:  I would use the Fusion to shave only for special or formal occasions, because of the cost of replacement blades and the shaving style needed for optimum work outweigh the benefits of the slightly better shave I could get.For regular everyday shaving, I\'m sticking with the M3 Power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

472,482,20060220,B000BUUVTE,2,"February 20, 2006",A3PE7YRXC8OFJ9,Full Head Shave - Skip It,"Four words, over priced, over hyped.  When compared with my old razor, the differences between shaving experiences were minimal at best.For one week, I shaved one side of my face and head with the Fusion, and the other side with my regular razor, the Schick Xtreme 3.  I am black, with tough beard hair, a shaved head, and a fumanchu moustache. I shave in the shower and wash my face before shaving.If you shave your face and head, I recommend you skip this razor.  For shaving the back of the head, the balance of the razor is awkward at best.  For shaving the rest of the head, it was no better then any other good blade.For shaving the face, the balance was good, but that was about it.  There was no difference in irritation between the two blades.  The lubricating strip faded to white after about four shaves, meaning you are no longer getting what Gillette calls an \'optimal shaving experience.\'I tried to trim the chin area between my fumanchu moustache. It did a horrible job, no matter how careful I was and the area was left feeling extremely irritated.Consider the Mach 3 over this razor.  If you must try this razor, keep the packaging and the receipt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My brother tried it and had the same problem in his words the razor sucks. I would really like to try the razor that they use in the commercial that glides over cause that\'s surely what i didn\'t get from this one. other than a cool appearance the razor is just a down grade from the original fusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4188,1568,20090321,B001G7PMW2,3,"March 21, 2009",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,"A fine shave, perhaps surpassed by other razors","The Gillette Sensor Excel is the second-generation razor from Gillette\'s long-lived Sensor line. The Sensor Excel blades were the first among Gillette razors to add rubberized \'microfins\' at the bottom of the cartridges...a standard they have included on every Gillette produce since Excel\'s debut. But with so many razors brought to market since its rollout, how does Sensor Excel stand up to competition today?Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor Excel. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Excel cartridges are noticeably smaller than, say, Mach 3 cartridges (about 1/3 smaller). The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than most razor systems today. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are very easy to shave as a result.The shave: 4.5 stars. One can tell that this truly was Gillette\'s workhorse model for quite some time, and that a lot of research & development went into the creation of this system. The Sensor Excel offers a comfortable shave with minimal drag, leaving the user feeling clean and smooth. As stated above, the blade angle and smaller cartridge design allows for easy precision shaving of sideburns and moustache/goatee areas--an ideal choice for men who maintain those types of facial hair. It is noteworthy that, as a person with sensitive skin, I felt no facial sensitivity after shaving with the Sensor Excel--something that I cannot say about newer razors such as Quattro and Fusion. For those with sensitive skin, this would perhaps be a wise choice.Durability: 2.5 stars. This was where Sensor Excel disappointed me. I get, at most, three shaves out of one cartridge. Drag and other issues resulting from dull blades arose quickly after two to three shaves. It\'s safe to say Sensor Excel has been surpassed by newer razors that have better blade coatings. By comparison, during my testing of the Gillette Fusion I got almost two weeks out of one cartridge. However, with the steep cost of blades for newer razors, Sensor Excel may still be a more affordable option.Overall: A fine razor offering a no-frills kind of approach to shaving. No advertising or fancy marketing to deal with when it comes to Sensor Excel--just a razor that does what it\'s supposed to do, well. Durability comes into question here as newer razors offer better blade coatings, but still a smart choice for those who don\'t buy into (and don\'t need) the uber-bladed razor trend.

I have been cursed with a lack of facial hair and only 1-2 chest hairs around my nipple region.  This is very upsetting to me as I think of all the funny facial hair I could grow.Anyway, I digress.  I have used Gillette products since I first started shaving, way back in the winter of \'97-98.  At that time I was borrowing my dad\'s Mach III to shave my sparse mustache (lip hair).  Since then I graduated to the Mach III, Mach III Turbo, Mach III Turbo Power, and finally the Fusion Power.  These blades last me (again at 2 per week) for about 1.5 months before they are noticeable duller.  Thus, this is good value (I paid $19 for the 6 pack last time I ordered.).  Gillette has consistently made great products and this is yet another addition to their fine line.  Highly recommended purchase.I leave you with this gem:[...]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1836,739,20060206,B000BUW8WM,4,"February 6, 2006",A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,Nice Shave But I\'ll Stick With The M3 Power,"I have been using Gillette\'s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it\'s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette\'s other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have tried, bought, or sampled just about everything out there except a straight razor.  I even have a very expensive safety razor \'kit\' I purchased from an internet supplier of shaving supplies.  The most expensive razor felt like I was using a Samurai sword on my face and it simply did not work as well as these Gillette Custom Plus pivoting razors did.  Again, maybe they just work well for \'my face\', i\'m not sure, but these work well for me.  Very comfortable, reasonably priced (about $1.30 a razor), and the longest use I get from a razor before I have to throw them away.  I would dare say (from my experience) that these razors use the exact same \'head\' or \'cartridge\' on them as the Gillette \'Sensor 3\' Razors which also work very well for me.  I always seem to come back to either the Custom Plus or Sensor 3 (both by Gillette) and again I think they use the exact same cartridge on top (triple blade) but they have a different shaped handle.  Thats the only difference between them.  I usually get about 7 to 10 days of shaving with these.  Other disposables give me 3 to 5 days before becoming very dull and unusable for my face.  Make sure you flush the blades out with water and let the razor dry after use for the best result and longest days of use.  Another trick with these (or any razor for that matter) is a high quality shave cream.  I\'m not talking about these \'foams\' or crap like that.  You know what i\'m talking about.  Get yourself a good quality shave cream in a jar and a badger hair brush to apply it with.  I know, some people may think i\'m crazy or something, but trust me on this one.  The badger hair brush (GOOD QUALITY ONE!) may cost you about $35 or up.... in price.  It will last a LONG TIME (years) if you take care of it and shake it out and dry it each day.  A good quality shave cream (such as something from Crabtree & Evelyn or Sephora, or ULTA will set you back between $20 to $30 a jar, tube, or tub but you use very little each day by applying it with the Badger hair brush you purchase and it will last forever trust me.  When I say it will provide you with a super close shave, I mean closer than using a cheap foam or gel.  I was about 40 years old when I finally broke down and bought a good quality Badger brush (after seeing reviews about them on-line) and I was so happy I did it I will never go back to those junk foams or gels that cost $2 at Walmart or similar locations.  You wouldn\'t think it would make that much of a difference, but trust me, IT DOES!!!!!  It just simply makes a difference, period.  Coupled with the Gillette Custom Plus razors and a good quality shave cream and Badger Hair brush, you\'ll have a great shave that is very close, even if you have a coarse beard like mine.  Happy shaving my friends!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought the shave gel strips would make the razor not shave close or that the shave gel strips wouldn\'t really be able to take the place of shave gel.  Then, I gave it a shot.  Wow!  The shave gel strips are quite effective and the razor shaved as close as any razor without the strips.  On purpose, I didn\'t use lotion or anything after shaving my legs to see if there would be any kind of razor burn from not using a shave cream, soap, etc.  Nothing!The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was due to what you get for the price.  The package says it is a one count, but goes on to say there are two of the head pieces included.  In other razors, this would typically mean there is one full razor (handle and head piece) and two refill head pieces.  On this, you get one handle and two head pieces.  At $10.99 a package, that makes these $5.50 each which is pretty pricey for a ladies razor.  I\'m also a little concerned that the life of the razor might be short because once the strips are gone, it is just a plain razor.  I\'ll have to update to let everyone know how long the strips lasted.UPDATEUnfortunately, this razor didn\'t stand the test of time.  The first shave was great.  The second was okay, but the strips were drying up.  On the third shave, one of the now dried up strips fell off.  On the second razor in the pack, it lasted about five shaves before one of the strips fell off.  So, I can\'t recommend this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

Though it did seem to make some sort of odd noise as it glided along my legs, it left me with a much smoother shave than any razor I\'ve used in quite some time.  It also came with a replacement head and a suction holder for the shower.  I\'m very pleased with this product and will continue to use it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When he first got it he said its just like the other razors and wont be much better. To his surprised he loved it. He talks about the close shave he gets and how he has less razor bumps.

I have purchased the refills faithfully and only used something different (Quattro) when I was traveling because I have a travel case for the other razor.I shave my face and head.  I use Gillette shave gel just as I have for years.On to the Proglide:I have never understood the point of a power razor that was not an electric razor.  Now that I have used a power razor, I still don\'t get it.  I have a hard time telling where the razor is on my head with the vibration activated.The blade has not lasted nearly as long as the original fusion blades.  I do not know what has changed, but after just two weeks of shaving, I look like a cat has gotten ahold of my head with his claws extended.  The original blades would last at least a month, but not so with this new blade.  I also do not get nearly the quality shave that I get with the original blades.I would save my money on this razor and go for the original fusion or even the quattro.  I got it for free in their promotion and my head wishes I had missed the link on Twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4110,1489,20101228,B001F51QWK,5,"December 28, 2010",A221UIO0NQ6FP,"Good shave, blue lubricating strips better than green","Review revised to 5 stars after manufacturer changed lubricating strip.  The new blue lubricating strip now lasts longer than the blades, and I use these for about 7 shaves (the older green strips did not last as long -- see below).  At this point I have no reservations and can fully recommend the product.OLD REVIEW:I like the shave that these give -- the blades are sharp and I rarely cut myself when they are fresh.  I think that the lubricating strip is better than most when I first use the razor.However, the lubricating strips don\'t last quite as long as other razors I\'ve used and I find myself wanting to replace them after about 5 shaves (I kept my previous razors for about 7).  In contrast to my other experiences, the blades are still sharp, but the lubricating strip is completely gone.  For what it\'s worth, I keep my razor in the shower -- I assume it\'s possible that they will last longer if I keep it elsewhere.Because of the good shave at first, I continue to subscribe to these razors.  I just factor in a higher cost because I go through them faster than other razors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve used Gillette Fusion Razors for years and always bought them at a brick and mortar store. This time, I figured I would save a little money and ordered through Amazon. The ad pictured a sealed pack of 12 razors. Well, I received my package today. Eight razors were in a sealed Gillette box and the other 4 were received unwrapped. I\'m pretty OCD about personal hygiene and to me, this is kind of disgusting. I have no idea where these exposed razors have been.Seller did refund my money, although he only needed to refund me for the 4 razors.

The Power Fusion is the best of the razors available. It is best with the vibrating feature which helps the blade to cruise over the skin surface with no drag. I use shaving oil alone as my lubricant... no shave cream at all. I put the oil on with my face very wet, shave down then up. Then I wet my face again with water alone, adding no more oil and shave again. I finish with any moisturizing face or hand cream rubbed over my shaved face, feel for any missed areas and shave those missed areas. When done, I have a perfect shave with NO irritation. Thanks to Gillette, shaving oil & hand or face cream !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a couple of hours I was getting tired of smelling it.  In the evening hours I teach guitar and I could still smell the loud perfumed scent and wondered if my students could smell it too.  It doesn\'t stink, it\'s just very potent.  My kids could smell it from across the room and without prompting the youngest said, \'I smell marshmallows!\'.It applies very easily and smoothly with no clumping.  No burn either on freshly shaved armpits.  I pulled on a clean, black short sleeve t-shirt and noticed a few light streaks on the fabric where it came into contact with my deodorized skin, but it was not nearly the whiteness that other deodorants leave behind.It\'s the next morning now as I type this review and I haven\'t showered yet and guess what I still smell?  The perfume from this deodorant.  For those who like a lot of perfume this deodorant is great stuff, but not a good idea for those who are sensitive to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I tried to avoid Gillette products because of the cost (I am a frugal college student), but I have never been satisfied with any other product. I do notice, however, that Gillette blades, including the Fusion ProGlide, do not last as long as other, cheaper products like disposable razors. They dull relatively quickly (about a week and a half for me with daily use). I should note that I have both more than average and thicker facial hair, which I am sure contributes to the short life of my blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can get at least 3-4 weeks of shaves on a cartridge before having to replace so this is a good value for me. The price here was half of what I\'d pay at even Sams Club, so this is the place to buy if you want this type of shaver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2099,1008,20080313,B000XVSNTQ,5,"March 13, 2008",A1Z8IV4TMMUEVD,This is the best razor that I have used so far,I bought this about 3 or 4 weeks ago and it work great! I know its just a razor and a lot of people don\'t care but I have sensitive skin and dark hair so I need a close shave but I also need a gentle shave. This razor provided both. I have used many razors from disposable single blade bic razors to an expensive electric shaver. This is better than all of them and is definately the best that Venus has put out on the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2152,1061,20080419,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 19, 2008",A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2,Is 5 blades really necessary?,"The Venus Embrace is a nice razor.  It had 5 blades, a surrounding cushion, a grippy handle, and it shaves beautifully.  I can\'t complain.  However, I\'ve been using a Venus for several years -- one with 3 blades -- and *it* shaves beautifully too.  The last time I shaved, I used both razors, one at a time of course, to see which performed better.  I really saw/felt no difference between the two.  The Embrace\'s 5 blades are smaller in width than the other razor\'s 3 blades.  The head of the Embrace is larger, supposedly to offer more cushioning.  But the difference between the two razors\' ability to shave really isn\'t noticable!  They both did a fine job!  So if you have an older-style Venus, you might as well keep using it.  No need to upgrade if you like the razor you already have.  And for those of you who haven\'t tried Venus razors, they allow you to give your legs safe, smooth shave.  I would recommend this product if you don\'t already have a razor you like.Edit: After several months of use, I can warn you... never leave this razor face-down on any surface (countertop, edge of bathtub, etc.)  The material surrounding the blade will stick to that surface and, when you try to pick up the razor, the material will rip like paper and leave a residue on the countertop or wherever (it can be removed, but it\'s sort of annoying.)  Be sure to make use of your razor holder!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fusion Proglide 6 pack of refills for the changable razor, isn\'t bad in one way where they are easy to install, but they can become quickly dull only after a few uses. They just don\'t have the strength to give the strongest shave possible in a longer time. I just honestly wish that Gilette can make a much stronger razor blade for all their customers, especially for men whom want the simplest shave desired. Still, I deeply suggest you keep seeking out a better razor, and better razor blade refills if you are interested in a changing razor brand like Gilette.Price: CConvience: C+Overall: C 1/2+",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am not encouraged by what I have read elsewhere: the purpose of nighttime application is to allow the aluminum to plug the sweat ducts overnight.  As a result of learning this, I have not \'rubbed in\' the deodorant, as the instructions indicate.  If this lessens its effectiveness, so be it.Prospective users should know that this is not actually a \'solid\', but a thick gel which is measured by \'three clicks\' of an applicator.

We both used this right after a shower and spent the whole day in the hot sun of florida working on the garden. By noon we both noticed we were getting rather fragrant and not in a good way. He kept trying it during the week while working in the very hot sun and by the fourth day of giving it every chance to work (using daily applications) he went back to his old Mitchum. I also tried it for a few more days and even spending the day in AC it wasn\'t working at all by late afternoon. I also went back to my old suave which works great for me. Another problem with this product is that the knob breaks easily if turned in the opposite direction so keep that in mind if you are brave enough to give this a try. This is the kind of applicator that you have to at first turn the knob for an eternity till the stuff squishes out of the tiny holes on the applicator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

361,370,20070109,B000277P5E,3,"January 9, 2007",AFO6FV7G060UM,Free sample,"Gilette really shot themselves in the corporate foot with me.  I had been shaving for twenty years with one electric razor or another and never got a good shave.  Finally got fed up with them and took notice of two free ones that Gilette sent me.  They sent me a free Fusion and Mach 3 Turbo.  One would think that Gilette would want me to use the more expensive model rather than the cheaper Mach 3.  Tried both and liked the Mach 3 better.  I will tell you why:1) The fusion has such a big head that there are some places that it simply can not go, I know that it has the blade on the back for those hard to reach places but that is only one blade - the Mach 3\'s head is much smaller and can get the whole head in those hard places.2)  Cost - why pay more gilette seems to think we want to pay more.3) Wilkerson Corp said it best when the company said \'the simple addition of one blade does not necessarily make for a better shave.\'  Only if things in life were that simple.Had Gilette not sent me the free Mach 3 I would have probably never known about it and stayed with the more expensive model.  Thanks to Gilette I will be sending them less money they I would have otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well...for the first time in the history of mankind...there\'s truth in advertising. OK, that\'s a bit of exaggeration on my part, but to be perfectly honest, it actually is the best razor that I have ever used...hands down. I usually only shave once a week (to my family\'s dismay), so my stubble is quite long. I use to have to trim down my semi-beard with an electric razor and then shave, but now I use the ProGlide and it literally \'glides\' through my stubble for a nice clean shave. I also like how the stubble doesn\'t get caught in between the blades. I use to have to bang the razor against the side of the sink to get the captured stubble hairs to come out of the razor, but those days are now long gone.If anyone is reviewing replacement blades (as I am doing here), there should be no question as to the satisfaction of the product (proved by the continuing purchase of the product).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2115,1024,20090815,B000XVSNTQ,3,"August 15, 2009",A1WPQGUYP0XI99,"Ok, But Not Great","I was fine with the Venus Divine version but the handle was getting cruddy so figured I would upgrade to the 5 blade version.  I used it for the first time yesterday and can\'t say I find it all that superior.  I did feel it left a smooth shave, but so does the Divine (3 blade version).  The handle felt no different as well, which is apparently one of the selling points to the Embrace since the handle has a bit of cushion and non-skid material.  The blade itself is fairly bulky, and can totally understand the concerns over it\'s size for more delicate areas with curves being more difficult to maneuver around.  The 5 blades are so closely stacked that it clogs quickly if you have more than 1 day of stubble to take care of.My biggest concern with this razor was that it had drag.  The blade cartridge has some \'special\' moisture strips or whatever they are meant to be that just grate over my skin.  It kept making me nervous that I was creating nicks up my legs!  I do have very sensitive skin, so perhaps this is why I didn\'t like the sensation of the actual cartridge, but I wouldn\'t imagine a well lathered leg (with Gillette\'s own shaving cream!) would create such a noxious scratchy drag.But, all this said, the razor gets the job done.  Once I use up the two cartridges/blades that comes with this razor, I will attach the Divine blades to it- which is a good selling point to have a razor that has the capacity to use all of the Venus blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2038,945,20080410,B000XVSNTQ,3,"April 10, 2008",A37E6RW5BUX4U0,"Eh, not bad, but not great!","I\'m not that impressed with this razor.  I am one of those people that can go about a week in between shavings.  My hair on my legs doesn\'t grow fast and when it does it\'s not that coarse.  After using this razor several times the results were that I always felt or could see hair the next day or two days later.  That leads me to believe that with 5 blades, it\'s still not a close shave.I also felt the razor head was surrounded on all four sides with way too much plastic; making the shaving of more delicate areas, bikini line, etc, a little more challenging.  I felt I was doing some serious contorting in the shower this morning, and felt if I could have removed some of the bulky plastic, I would have been much better off.I did like the shower case that suctioned to the shower wall, I liked that a lot.  I also enjoyed the fact that I didn\'t have any razor burn or bumps.All in all I just don\'t think it\'s worth the hype.  The 5 blades didn\'t do anything more or extra that I could tell, and the surrounding plastic hindered anything the blades could have possibly done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The downside is they only last for about 3 shaves for me and the hairs start to get stuck in the blades after two shaves so it\'s really hard to clean.  But the price is right, so I don\'t mind throwing the blades away after three shaves because its still cheaper than buying the Mach 3 refills.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1871,776,20080515,B000BUW8WM,5,"May 15, 2008",A204RP75MC91RN,The Old and the New,"I have used the Mach 3, the Quattro and now the Fusion Power, the Mach 3 for 6 years, the Quattro for three years and the Fusion Power for one month.The Mach 3 was an absolute revelation when I first started using it and people thought I was a bit over the top in blissfully describing how good the razor was.  Cynics of course would find it hard to eulogise over what was obviously just another fad and a rip off.  10 years later the Mach 3 is still VERY highly regarded and widely used even with the coming of the might Fusion Power with a whole two more blades and a built in vibrator to pleasure you even further.I thought I\'d experiment with the Quattro a few years back and I thought it was an improvement on the Mach 3.  I just liked the way it felt and shaved although it didn\'t shave any better than the Mach 3.  I did have one irritation though as it clogged up quite often and it was hard to get clean.  I even used scrubbing brushes to clear it, not always successfully.  I must have liked the razor though as I didn\'t toss it.My Dad was over on holiday and had forgotten his electric razor and was forced to buy a razor.  He happened to get the Fusion Power and he laughed about the five blades and vibrator.  He was soon mightily impressed with it though.  I haven\'t found out though whether he has continued to use it or not.A month ago after the blades for my Quattro were done, I decided to buy this Fusion Power.  I did read the review which were split on whether it shaved any better but everyone, almost, who used it liked it.I bought it and wasn\'t disppointed.  It is a lovely razor to use and the vibrator is novel.I then bought a brand new Mach 3 to compare this Fusion Power with.  I showered then lathered up and did half my face with each one then looked closely.  The shave was pretty much the same for both sides but bear in mind that the blade on the Fusion was a month old!  Mind you both sides felt very smooth although on closer inspection this wasn\'t the case.  It just proved to me that my technique may be a bit average and that you can\'t shave the hairs to the surface of the skin (unlike the simulations you see on TV).I have to say though that the Fusion is one hell of a razor.  It looks so cool and the tactile feel and shape is a big improvement over the Mach 3.  Shaving itself feels much the same though.  I don\'t have a challenging growth though, it is pretty average and I think the most important thing to get a good shave is to shower first.  After a shower you can almost get away with no shaving cream , that\'s how big a difference it makes.Overall in spite of the blades being twice the price almost, I love the fusion.  Gillette have made a product that is a perfect synthesis of engineering genius and marketing passion to produce a truly wonderful prodcut.I hate them of course as they have tempted me to buy a product that is objectively, no better than the Mach 3 but in the final analysis the sex appeal of this fine razor won me over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

2172,1081,20080416,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 16, 2008",AN2CU1YP12J4U,Just in time for bikini season...,"With only a few months away from bikini season, and with more than a few winter-pounds still left to shed, a girl needs all the help she can get to bolster her confidence.  Smooth, silky, hairless legs are a good start.  And the Gillette Venus Embrace Razor is the pefect razor to leave a sun-loving lady\'s long legs lovely and smooth.I was very impressed with this razor.  The 5 Curve-Hugging Blades glided over my legs and around the more delicate curves (let your mind wander).  Unlike other razors, I did not have to shave twice to remove all unwanted follicles.  One pass did the job and left my legs nbelievably smooth.  The Protective Ribbon of Moisture that surrounds the blades allowed them to glide over my legs, around my ankles and knees, and left my skin feeling as if I had just put lotion on it.The razor is light-weight, easy to hold, and feels good in the hand.What I liked best about this razor was the Shower Pod, the nifty little container that holds the razor and spare blades.  The pod has suction cups that allows it to be placed in the shower - without taking up precious space for my other necessary beauty products.  I placed the pod on one wall of my shower three weeks ago and it is still firmly in place.  It has not fallen once.I highly recommend this razor to all of my sisters in bikinis, preparing for the summer season, or those women who have been stealing their husband\'s blades (totally guilty here).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

2136,1045,20080515,B000XVSNTQ,4,"May 15, 2008",A2GCVTKDDOKRRX,"Good, but ....","The Venus Embrace is a good razor.  I got a smooth shave without nicks and I found the semi-solid handle to be ingenious.The five blades, on the other hand, seem a bit like overkill.  I shaved one leg with the five bladed Venus Embrace and another leg with my three bladed plain old Venus and I honestly did not notice a difference.  Both were smooth at the start without nicks, and both grew back at about the same rate.  I\'m of the opinion that the quality of your shave depends more on the quality of the blade than simply the number of blades.If you\'re looking to get this razor just for it\'s five blades, I can\'t say it\'s worth the cost.  As a razor, it\'s great, but it\'s not better than a three-blade as far as I\'m concerned.However, the semi-solid handle may be worth it.  It\'s comfortable to hold and use and moves with you to some extent.  It gets in the tight places better than other razors and helps to keep you from pressing too hard against your skin as you go.As for me, I\'m keeping my Venus Embrace handle and buying whatever cartridges are least expensive when I go shopping.  With four kids, I find the Venus Breeze cartridges to suit my short shower needs best.  Those and the Embrace handle are a great fit for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mach3 made my face feel so smooth and even after two passes with this razor, I still feel rough areas.I always wash my face before I shave and use shaving cream and I still have a problem with nicks.I will not be buying these again. I will either go back to the Mach3 or I will use the Schick Hydro.I\'ve used the Mach3 since around 1999 and I think it is the perfect razor.

1874,779,20080207,B000BUW8WM,1,"February 7, 2008",A29WWNOYAM96QB,A Real Dissappointment.,"Let me tell you first, I\'m a Gillette fan, I have been using Gillette razors for over 18 years, I was always excited when they released a new razor because every time it was better than the old one.So, possibly you wonder why I gave a 1-start poor rating to this product. I was excited to buy this new line of product, as being certain it would have been better than the previous line Mach 3 Turbo. Result a real disappointment. Here are the reasons from a Gillette fan you can trust:1. 5 razors don\'t work. Over the years for the sake of competition they made double blades, triple blades than it was not enough they released 5-bladed razors like this one. However, since they needed to put the blades closer to each other to fit 5 blades in a limited area of razor head, it simply didn\'t work. Let\'s continue,2. This product has very sharp blades but since 5-very sharp blades are located very close to each other it resulted very bad maneuverability. You simply cut yourself easily if you made a slight side movement while shaving.3. Blades are so sharp it doesn\'t allow you to focus on flat surfaces for a close shave. It just goes through and if you insisted on getting for a closer shave you will cut yourself.4. You might think I have a sensitive skin type, BUT believe me I don\'t. Believe it or not with a Mach 3 I never cut myself never, never. I have very thick and strong hair, I can\'t use a regular razor for shaving. Only and Only Gillette Mach 3 handles my facial hair but not this one.5. This product has engineering flaws which is resulted from competitive 5-blade which are put very closely together and you cannot handle this razor well even if you are a surgeon. I know because I\'m  very successful with using my hands because of my profession. But thanks to engineers who developed this I cut myself with this razor, for the first time.6. It\'s your choice whether or not you buy this product but I want to remind you that for the first time I\'m taking my time and writing a review for a razor, be careful it\'s a razor not a Gillette anymore.A final personal shaving tip: If you want your high quality razor blades last longer than usual, do not rinse them with hot or warm water while shaving. If you use cold water for rinsing blades, you will see them lasting sharp for a longer period of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which razor you use is really worth the money. I have used Schick Quattro the standard non battery one and its ok but for my head I use the Gillette Fusion power. I Recently both this razor and was amazed!! My face is a maze to shave it as if i do not do it right i end up cutting myself and have a crappy shave job. With this new razor not only does it work for my face but also for my head which i shave almost daily. I also shave against the grain all the time to get the best shave possible. With this new razor i love shaving and get the best shave!!! Thank you Gillette. This product is worth the money for me but if you don\'t need the best shave or don\'t care enough about your face you can get another razor. I for one am tired of going to work with blood on my face from shaving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fusion ProGlide Styler is a versatile, powerful-yet-gentle grooming tool. I\'ve always been reluctant to put a powered razor on my skin, so I also purchased the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Clear Shave Gel to serve as a conditioning buffer between skin and machine. I am impressed by the ProGlide\'s range of function in the shower. I\'ve found that the trimmer trims a lot more than beard, if you know what I mean. The kit includes enough accessories to make even the most high maintenance well-groomed person happy. On the down side, the cartridges sell at a price that would only make a Gillette stockholder happy, but they have a stellar performer on their shelves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difference between the two -- the \'microcomb\' at the edge of the Power\'s cartridge, which allegedly exists to \'help guide the hair to the blades,\' seems like a silly concept to me.  Then again, I\'m a daily shaver and my hair isn\'t so long after one day that it needs to be \'guided\' into the razor blade.  :)I do like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave.  I never get nicked or scratched when using a Fusion blade unless I\'ve been using it too long; the first nick is a sign that the blade is dull and needs to be replaced, which sometimes happens before the lubricating strip indicates a replacement is warranted.  I get about two week\'s worth of shaves out of each cartridge and don\'t do anything special to try to prolong their life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You put on the shaving cream, you wet the razor, then you move the cutting surface around on your face and behold the hair is removed.  The face is shaved just as it was with three blades & power, three blades & no power, two blades, I even remember shaving with a single bent razor and that worked quite well.  And with all those other razors I didn\'t need a second mortgage to change the razor cartridge.I like the feel of the handle, I like the battery indicator, I like the new design, but seriously the increase in the quality of the shave isn\'t enough to justify the cost of the replacement cartridges.  At just under $15 for 4 pack, just under $30 for and 8 pack I\'ll stick with my Turbo Mach 3 razor, where I can get 8 cartridges for $7. I\'ll use the 4 cartridges I have and wait for the price to come down when Gillette comes to their senses in about six months.I\'m glad I have it; I look forward to using it when it loses its newness on the market and the price comes down, and then I\'ll be one of the cool kids.

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

Less enthused when I read further and found out they won\'t ship to Alaska because this is a decent price on these cartridges and the subscribe option looks great.My husband and I have been using Sensors for the last 20 years. They give a nice clean shave and the blades last us a week which is a lot better than how quickly newer razors seem to last since they are so thin to have so many blades in a cartridge. I also like the smaller head for getting around curves on my legs.We have tried some of the newer razors with more blades and other options, and keep going back to the Sensor. It\'s a good solid design that\'s stood the test of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought it would be the best razor ever (based on the quality and reputation of the Gillette brand and all that advertising).  Did not give me a close shave at all and found the razor catridges to be duller than previous models (like the MACH5 and Turbo).  The ONLY good feature was the single blade on the reverse side - great for evening out side-burns, but other than that I do NOT reccommend.

I wish the trimmer length was adjustable (though since i usually go shortest length, it\'s fine - I never seem to remove the guide for the shortest beard length), and wish the razor wasn\'t a snap on snap off piece (same for the trimmers).

5642,1944,20110210,B003983HZK,5,"February 10, 2011",A1GSP89MGIZ91L,"Pricey, but worth it!","Yes, I can understand how paying up to $3 per blade is unreasonable for a lot of people.  I can sympathize.  When you go as far as to skip shaving because it\'s too expensive, you know there\'s a problem.However, I\'ve found that the Fusion blades are, like the Mach 3 before them, worth the extra cost.  I have very thick, fast-growing facial hair, which earned me more than my share of scrutiny when I was in the military.  Therefore, I need razors that can cut through it without excessive strokes that each take a bit of skin with them.The Mach 3 was a huge improvement over dual-blade razors for me, and for quite a while I stuck with those rather than paying a premium for the Fusion 5-blades.  Also affecting my decision was the old Onion article: \'**** Everything, We\'re Doing Five Blades,\' which reinforced my perception that a five-bladed razor was nothing but a marketing gimmick.And perhaps it is - but it shaves noticeably better than the Mach 3, either because of the additional blades or some other less-obvious improvements.  Not only do I get a better shave with fewer strokes, but I can even skip a couple days and then cut through the beginnings of a hoary beard with little effort.And even better, the new razors seem to last longer than the Mach 3s, giving half a dozen shaves or more before they need replacement.  The Mach 3s gave up the ghost after just 3 or so.I certainly recommend these razors if the cost is not a huge obstacle, especially if you\'ve got facial hair from hell like I do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4429,1818,20100601,B003983HRI,3,"June 1, 2010",AORCXT2CLTQFR,The Gillette Fusion line\'s latest incarnation.,"When the original (manual) Fusion shaving system was introduced in 2005, it was truly a major improvement over any and all previously available razors. It was (and still is) a truly revolutionary, advanced and innovative shaving system that made shaving virtually painless and hastle-free even for men with tough beards and/or sensitive skin. The ProGlide is the latest incarnation of the Fusion and it does offer some advantages over the original Fusion but not nearly enough to justify switching over (especially when considering that the replacement cartridges will be even more expensive than the manual Fusion\'s!). When I shaved my head with the ProGlide, I honestly noticed NO difference whatsoever (neither better nor worse) than when I shave with the manual Fusion. When shaving my face, I did notice that the ProGlide DID do a slightly better job than the manual Fusion at shaving tricky and hard-to-reach areas (especially the moustache area just below the nostrils and around my Adam\'s apple) but this is probably because the ProGlide\'s cartridges are supposedly 15% thinner than the Fusion\'s. I should also point out that the ProGlide\'s handle feels more sturdy and offers a (somewhat) tighter grip than the (manual or Power) Fusion\'s and that the design is more elegant but (of course) beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The Bottom Line: Fusion ProGlide offers some minor improvements over the manual Fusion but nowherenear enough to justify upgrading to an even more expensive product when an already excellent one is available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I perspire normally, so I didn\'t need major protection. The claims of be shirt friendly and going on cleanly are also accurate. I don\'t understand the reviews that claim the product leaves a flaky white residue -- I imagine those reviewers are just using too much product. In my experience, if you use the suggested amount then you won\'t have residue.My biggest gripe with this product is the smell. It\'s way too strong. If you don\'t wear cologne or perfume, then it might not be an issue for you, but this product will definitely clash with other scents.

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

I\'ve tried crappy Bic disposables and I\'ve tried the Schick Quattro.From best to worst it\'s: Gillette Custom Plus Pivot 9/10, Mach 3 Turbo 8/10, Mach 3 7/10, Schick Fusion Quattro (disposable) 6/10 and either of the Fusions, 5/10.The Mach 3 Turbo was my preferred razor for years! I loved it and kept it sharp by rubbing the blade with an alcohol prep pad and storing it *outside* the bathroom to make it last longer. It worked, too!I always buy a pack of cheap disposables for summer travel: to my parents\' house, to his parents\' house, on vacation, everywhere. I ran out of the Schick Quattro disposables so I figured I\'d try something new. My brother\'s girlfriend is half Mexican so she has SUPER thick hair - she told me to try the Custom Plus Pivots out.Wow. What a razor! For 1/3 or 1/2 the cost of a Mach 3 blade you get an ultra sharp, durable and long lasting razor. The moisturizing strip is HUGE!I can\'t believe these are so great. I will say that for bikini line usage I still slightly prefer the Mach 3 because it can pivot more than these do. These are great for legs, armpits and face.Overall a steal!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2427,1343,20080809,B001F51QJ8,5,"August 9, 2008",A2KP4CWYUTKUFO,A great product!,"This is a fantastic product that does what it promises to do!  I am the kind of person that finds a product that works and uses it for a long time.  I have been using Mitchum deodorant for over 10 years.  Because of my allergies to perfumes and fragrance, I could not use the other Gillette Clinical Strength products. However, when I found this one, it passed the sniff test.  Although it has a scent, it is best described as a \'masking scent.\' This means that while the product is on me, I do not smell it. I can smell it when I put it on, but it does not make me sneeze.  That means, throughout the entire day, I have the protections of the product without the fragrance.The deodorant instructions state to put it on at night, since that is when it works best.  I follow those instructions, but I also put on a small amount after my showers.  It is hot in Southern California, and I have to walk a far distance to teach my classes on campus. I sweat, and what professor wants to stink in front of their class?  Compared to the Mitchum (and a few others I experimented with) this product is the best deodorant I have ever used.  I do not smell myself in front of the class room while teaching.  I have worked outside all day, sweating in hot weather, and when I come inside the house, my underarms smell like I just put the deodorant on.I highly recommend this product.  I have allergies, so I am limited to certain kinds of hygiene products.  Although not completely scent free, this deodorant has done a great job controlling odor and wetness without bothering my nose.  I am more comfortable now because I do not have to worry about smelling bad when talking to someone!Give it a try, and I hope it works for you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basically, I was just looking for a replacement handle for my regular fusion cartridges, because I left mine in the locker room. I read that it should fit the older cartridges, and for $3 bucks, I figured it was a good deal. My disappointment came when I opened the package from Amazon today and realized that it did not have a tray/holder for the razor/handle to sit on. I don\'t want this thing loose in my bag, and was expecting it to have something for it to sit in. I\'m sure it will shave great tomorrow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gel bars are a nice feature but they didn\'t eliminate the need for soap or shaving cream to prevent nicks.  I got a few nicks and I rarely do so when I shave with just a bit of baby wash and a Silky Effects razor.  I was being careful as well, not trying to test out how well it could do with careless shaving.The shape of the razor does allow for a closer shave which I appreciate.  Plus, it has a wide head which allows for more surface area and less sweeps to be made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel more comfortable with it when I\'m shaving in the shower.  It was worth the extra cost to me.When the original Fusion came out I compared to the Mach3, but couldn\'t tell much difference.  With a 2-day growth, I used a fresh Mach3 blade and a fresh Fusion blade, and they both pulled a little.  The only big improvement I could see was the top blade for under-nose trimming.Now, the Proglide is a different story.  I skipped a day shaving and did the same test.  The Mach3 pulled like pliers on my chin hair, but the Pro glided right through.  I think the thinner blades schtick is more than a marketing line.  At least for me it is.I\'d give it 5 stars, but it hasn\'t done anything magical like make me irresistible to the opposite sex :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1709,610,20061024,B000BUUVTY,5,"October 24, 2006",A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,Best shaver I\'ve ever had.,"I\'m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was very impressed with the shave, it was very smooth and much more comfortable than any two blade razor. What was most impressive was it cut far less than the other razors. The turbo option doesnt really improve the shaving experience though and so I shave without the turbo power. I do have to shave on the same spots again but I do not feel any discomfort as compared to the other razors. The trimming blade too is useful especially when working on the sideburns and underneath the neck, but it takes some time to figure out the \'correct\' way of holding the handle in this position.But alas, all good things have a price and this one might be too expensive in the long run. I will have to see how many shaves my blades last to get the economics right.In short, if you are still stuck with two blades and want to move to better options, I highly recommend this razor if you can afford the blades in the long run. But give it a try and see the difference !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4223,1605,20090522,B001JQLNFA,5,"May 22, 2009",ACK880145VWRV,An Excellent Product,"I enjoyed pilot-testing this razor.  It has little \'wings\' of soap on either side of the triple blades that flex to fit the contours of the body.  Its \'white tea\' fragrance is pleasing but mild, and I think it would pass muster with most sensitive noses.  The grip is comfortable even in my nondominant hand, and the light pink color is very subtle--not too girlie.  About the only minor gripe that I had with the Sea Breeze is that it comes with a bulky holding case that can be mounted on the wall of a shower.  The case is intended to store the razor and a couple of blade-and-soap cartridges, but it was not too esthetic so I just didn\'t install it.  Otherwise,this item deserves a high recommendation.  (Oh, and did I mention that it gives a great shave?)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may be a bit pricey but I have never had a closer shave with any other product. I switched from a \'three-blade\' system which was good but it can not compare to the 5 blade.

Maybe that\'s where the advances end since I could not tell a difference in shaving between this razor and the Schick Quattro and M3Power razor.  I don\'t feel like it gets a closer shave.  In fact, I don\'t notice any advantages in this razor at all.If you have never used a \'Power\' razor before, try it.  The vibrating that is put off by the batteries is very slight but definitely makes for a closer shave. Battery life is long, and one advantage this razor has is a low battery life indicator. That\'s about it though. The trimmer that was hyped so much is pretty much useless.  I am not a very hairy guy, but I tried it on my sideburns and it didn\'t do anything. Maybe I wasn\'t using it correctly but I couldn\'t tell what it was supposed to do.  As for under the nose, it was worthless there too.The major disadvantage of this razor are the blades.  You\'re going to pay an average of $3 per blade! Considering a blade lasts two weeks at most (which is how often you should replace them, regardless of whether they still work), prepare yourself for a $60 a year razor budget.  The M3Power blades are only $2 a blade, and backwards compatible with previous razors.If money is no object and you don\'t already have an M3Power, this isn\'t a bad razor, but it\'s not nearly worth the hype and price when compared to its predecessor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The price differance is not much worse, if you buy the new razors online at Amazon. The handle on this thing has much more style, and is a lot more attractive than the sensor 3 and really has a nice precise feel, in your hand. It shaves incredibly close, and does an excellent job, going againest the grain! You look forward to shaving, which is something that never happened before. And you feel like a million bucks when you are done! I have already ordered a champion one with the red and black color scheme, because I\'m a Chicago Bulls fan.

P&G doesn\'t distribute our products through Amazon.  If you have questions about the authenticity of the product you purchased, please contact Amazon.  In the meantime, I\'m sharing your message with our Security Team.The safest, most reliable way to purchase our products is through retail stores.  [...]Judging by the mixed reviews, some people may get real blades and some may not.  In any case, if you get fake ones you have to pay the postage to return them to get your refund so you will lose time and money if you come up with the counterfeits.  Also consider that you may get reasonably good counterfeits (though doubtful) which still isn\'t giving you the actual product\'s quality experience.  Because I had to return the blades to the reseller I was unable to send them to Proctor and Gamble for their security team to research.  All I\'m saying is, it\'s a gamble to save a few dollars.

Though it neither possesses zillions of blades nor vibrates, it shaves closer than razors that do. Cartridges for it are also slightly cheaper than those for the Mach 3 or other high-end razors.These 5-count packages (bundled in packs of 2) are also a phenomenally good deal, especially if you purchase them using Amazon\'s subscribe-and-save. My only complaint is that, in these bundles, the blue lubricating strip normally at the top of the razor has been replaced by a white and noticeably less lubricating version.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

However insanely high price of replacement razors forced my hand. And to my relief, the razors are quite good -- I see no difference from the ones purchased at the local supermarket or drugstore.So rest assured, these razors are regular Gillette replacement razors and not some low-grade version.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2093,1002,20080326,B000XVSNTQ,5,"March 26, 2008",A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,form follows function....,"I have been on the look out for a while for a good razor with replaceable cartridges and though many are fine and fit the bill, I thought this one gave me the little bit extra that will keep me coming back.I have purchased Venus products in the past but when I could no longer find the blades at my local store for my regular model I bought a lady schick.  The lady schick is fine, but not much movement in the head and the shave is thus sometimes not as close as I\'d like. I also tried the Venus with the moisture bars, and that was kind of messy and not really a fit for what I was looking for.Here is what I was looking for and what I found with this Venus Embrace:I want a plain razor, I don\'t want soapy little moisture bars around my blade (one of the previous Venus razor\'s I tried).I want a head that can move with the contours of my body-hey, an armpit is not an easy thing to shave if the head has limited mobility, right?I would love a place to store the cartridges, and with this model the shower caddy opens to keep my spare cartridge-great idea!  Now I don\'t have to rummage around soapy and dripping to find a replacement in the drawer when my blade is dull- it is right there and ready to go!I like something easy to grip.  This razor is slim and sleek and has a nice indent for my thumb and has a sturdy gel grip.I want a razor that gives me a nice shave-this one does it.  Nice and close.The looks of the unit?  Well, not that important if it is good, but this one also has a good design, dual colored in green and glue, with a cute little circular shower caddy.I think it is a good value and I will definitely be ordering refills and keeping this one as my primary razor.I think this one does it all, it is simple, well designed, gives a great shave and has a pleasant design. No complaints here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1879,785,20071130,B000BUW8WM,2,"November 30, 2007",A1W8O19X4C0KIA,Mach 3 is a better razor,"The Fusion razor looks snazzy, but in NO WAY does it give a better shave than the Mach 3.  The blades are dull and worn out after one use, whereas you can get 2-3 shaves with the Mach 3 before you need to change the blade.  At $3 per blade that is not worth it.I am getting rid of the Fusion and sticking with the Mach 3, a better and more reasonable product....until GE comes out with another over priced product that doesn\'t work as well as the original.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5578,1878,20101010,B003983HRI,4,"October 10, 2010",AMCX84U402LW3,Close shave,"Got this for my boyfriend and his review is as follows:I am not a big fan of the latest and greatest or gimmicky razors. My usual go-to-razor is a 3-blade store brand, which works just as good as the old Gillette Sensor. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the close shave from the Fusion Proglide. I still feel the additional blades (over 3) does not contribute to the closer shave. It is a result of the tension strip that stretches your skin as you shave. Although it is a great shave, I don\'t think the additional costs (or blades) justify the extra expense versus a standard 3-blade razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The \'gel\' versions destroy my t-shirts, leaving them with yellow stains.  I also wonder how safe they are because it feels like putting paint on your skin.This new \'clear shield\' product was just right- strong enough for the whole day, yet not pasty or sticky.  The fragrance is just about right, there, but not too strong.Which deodorant a man uses is quite personal, so it may not be for you, but it was good for me, and I\'m much pickier than most.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2146,1055,20080424,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 24, 2008",A3B48AN8JID1JK,Shaved Without a Nick!  Whoopee,"I don\'t normally shave my legs during the day and then leave the house.  The reason is, no matter how careful I REALLY try to be, I ALWAYS end up with a nick somewhere.  Picture shorts with little pieces of tissue looking like polka dots on your legs!  Normally, I shave my legs in a tub rather than a shower, as the leg is not flexed and there is less chance of a nick - though somehow I always managed (especially around the shin bone) to draw blood.HOWEVER, all that changed with the new Gillette Venus Embrace Razor!  No nicks - no blood and one of the smoothest shaves ever!!!!!!  I shaved my legs in the shower too!!!I loved the no slip soft-grip handle and it was especially convenient to have the holder suctioned to the wall. The 5 blade curve hugging aspect made shaving my legs in the shower a DOUBLE treat ---One of the closest, smoothest shaves ever, AND I didn\'t have to wash spots of blood out of my sheets the next morning!Marilyn Rondeau",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5743,2045,20100812,B003987CL0,5,"August 12, 2010",A2LXGLSCCV4QD9,"Great for your girlfriend, too.","I received this in the mail for free when Gilette was promoting the release of this razor. Since I have a unisex name,  I occasionally get men\'s products. Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it. I\'ve never used a razor with the vibrating feature on it before, but I found this great for my legs, especially my knees and ankles. I\'ve NEVER cut myself using this blade, because with the vibration turned on, it\'s pretty much impossible for me to press down too hard. It doesn\'t vibrate too much to where it\'s noisy or annoying.As far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth. I can go 2-3 days between shaves, and when my hair starts to regrow, the hair is finer and not as \'stubbly.\' I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I\'ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus. I also love that this works so well on my underarms. Because it\'s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I\'ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before. This shaves super close without cutting or razor burn. And my legs are smooth ALL day, even if I shave at 8 in the morning. They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night. Ladies, you know what I\'m talking about.I haven\'t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy. The blades seem to last a while, at least 3-4 weeks shaving every other day or so. However, when they go dull, they go dull quickly.The only things I didn\'t like about this razor: one, it didn\'t come with a blade refill, like every other razor I\'ve ever bought, so that was kind of annoying. Also, the refills are expensive. Don\'t buy the \'power\' refills if you don\'t use the trimmer- that\'s the only difference between the \'power\' blades and the \'manual\' blades, and there\'s a dollar difference between the two. I don\'t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out that it\'s just an exposed blade on the opposite side, but I can see how men might find it useful.Overall, this is my favorite razor. I bought the refills even though they were expensive, and will probably be sticking with this for a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a great deal for the price.  $4.20 with free shipping.  I have used these shavers for several years and I like them.  I'll use this one when I travel.

But is it sigificantly better than the original fusion? This is what I\'ve found. I shave in the shower, warm water, using a unscented Gillette shaving gel. The handle of the proglide has a slightly different shape, more of a knob at the end. I suppose the knobv makes it easier to grasp the end of the razor when making gentle swipes alog the skin, sort of an artist at work. But the handle of the original fusion is also okay, and I don\'t think the new handle is much of an improvement, if any. The blades in  the cartridge are great, more than marginally better than the original. A few easy swipes do the job for most of the face. I\'ve found the razor shaves closer than the original about the neck and above the upper lip. Result is the shave time is quicker with a good result. I also believe a proglide cartridge will last longer than the fusion. I\'ve used one cartridge for about twenty shaves, and so far it is doing the job. thus, since the cartridge seems to give more shaves, that fact ought to offset the extra cost. Bottom line is, the new proglide fusion is great, better than the original, but since the original fusion cartridges also do a great jobb, I plan to use them up before switching over to the proglide.Update april 2011 - I think the proglide works best for men who shave every day, and against the grain for a close shave. The blades are thin and close and work best with short hairs. When shaving with two or more days of growth, hthen it\'s best to first shave downward, with the grain, and then up against the grain to get a close shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	5	""July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5878,2184,20101111,B003987CL0,4,"November 11, 2010",AZYGZK8MULQTI,Solid Build -Gillette Fusion Proglide Power,"I have been using Mach 3 Power previously and the blades had to be replaced frequently.  The turning point for me was, when the battery eventually leaked and corroded the internals (handle grip).  Tried the cheap (U$70) Philips battery operated travel-shaver for 6 months.  Unfortunately, I still missed the close-shaves from the blade shavers.  Finally, I took the plunge again - this time the Fusion Proglide Power.I have since been getting good results from it.  Maybe it is just psychology, but I feel that it had a closer shave compared to the Mac3 Power.  So far, after weeks of daily usage, I have not had a blade-change yet.  What I like was the flip over edge, to get a closer cut especially under the nose area, and below the lower lips.On another note, it did not shave too well when I use it with the Fusion HydraGel Moisturizing Shaving Gel.  Perhaps the Gel is too thick and the blades are floating rather than getting closer to the skin.Overall, it was a good investment for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve never had a razor shave this close and this clean. I\'ve been using it for a month now and there\'s no sign of a low battery.My only complaint - and this is a complaint about the disposable razor industry and all industries built on this model (ink jet printers anyone?) - is that the blades cost waaaay too much. $14 for 4 blades is criminal. I\'m still trying to find the best price but $13-$15 for the 4-pack seems to be the norm. Ugh. The good news is that I seem to be able to use the blades longer.

I never get that \'tug and pull\' feeling. My only complaint is the lotioning strip thing. It tends to wear out before the blades do making it slightly uncomfortable to shave with.

Unlike most razors, it does exactly what it claims to do: glides across the face and neck without even a hint of friction or irritation. Thus, it\'s now my razor of choice.That said, the ProGlide isn\'t cheap. In fact, at roughly three dollars a cartridge the cost of ownership is fairly outrageous.

This is probably the best shave you\'ll ever have if you\'re used to using disposable blades. Only downside is that the replacement blades are a bit pricey and you need to replace them quicker then on a Mach 3 or 5. But other then that, it\'s well worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, the Venus Embrace does.It starts with the handle, which is coated with some new and soft gel-like material. Even holding the razor with wet and soapy hands is not a problem - the grip remains very secure, no effort at all.Using the Embrace is absolutely pleasant. For the first time since I began using such razors it didn\'t feel \'dangerous\' or as if my skin was being scraped - the new \'Ribbon of Moisture\' is a great and very noticeable step up from the previous \'moisture strips\' Gillette used. The 5 blades also feel totally safe. As a matter of fact they do what is advertised and feel like they actually adjust to the contours of the skin. I was truly impressed, because other razor models had made such claims before but I had never been able to actually feel that.Lastly, the results are equally great. I had used the Venus Vibrance before and find that the Embrace does a much better job. I can\'t stop touching my skin - it feels so incredibly smooth. The storage unit, the \'Shower Pod\', is nice and practical but nothing out of the ordinary and in itself not a reason to buy the Embrace.All in all, Gillette has definitely created a winner here, and I will stick with this model for a long time to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel that Gillette makes quality products, I have been satisfied with their shaving products etc.  Just tried their new body wash for the shower and find it superior to what I was using....anyway, on a whim, I got this antiperspirant. It claims to have longer lasting qualities, says you should be able to apply the night before and be good to go the following day.  Now, that in itself would be great because I am so disorganized in the morning...It is effective much longer.  The night before, after the shower application is effective for the next entire day.  I can just be a bit more disorganized in the morning, without bumbling around trying to do the deodorant thing!  Ahh, life is sweet!

That is proof of the pudding with their Gilette Fusion Proglide Power razor, and their refill cartridges. While the concept is right with the closeness of a shave, the big gripe about it is that the cartridges quickly get dull only after a few uses. That dullness gets very tiresome, even with the toughest of shaving creams and mixes to make it easier for your best shave. I really think Gilette needs to honestly find a better razor blade with their next brand of razor.

These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.I don\'t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it\'s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I\'ve never had any problems with the handle, and I\'ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.This particular deal for one razor and two cartridges at $3.19 is a great deal.

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

One would think that I wouldn\'t balk at having to replace these Gillette cartridges, but their price just does not justify their performance.I started shaving using the Gillette Sensor Excel when I was a teenager.  I upgraded to the Gillette Mach3 when it came out, and I was pretty happy with the results.  Now, after a year of using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide, I\'m going back to the Mach3.The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide does provide a close shave.  It\'s the closest I\'ve ever had, to be honest.  The problem is that the blades get too dull to use within a week.  Oh, I could still use them, but then I\'d be tugging at hair instead of cutting through the hair.  My Mach3\'s cartridges would last three months before hitting the waste basket.  And the vibrating mechanism doesn\'t do a lick of good, either.  I have had just as good of results when leaving the battery powered vibrator off.Now, if I could afford to spend $100 a year on razor cartridges, I would stick with the Pro Glide.  But when there are cheaper alternatives that don\'t do all that poorly in their own right, there is only one decision that makes sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not like the other razors that clog up and you have to tap the blade on the sink to try to get the gunk out.The brilliant move to include a single blade on the back of the cartridge has made my life easier.This razor is so good, I bought one for my home and one for my travel kit.Give it a try!PS - The Fusion Power worked OK, it just didn\'t cut as smooth.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.

I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I\'ve used in the past.  However, as other reviewers have noted, it\'s not as \'rich\' or full-bodied when it comes out of the can.  The \'instructions\' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams).  Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it\'s good foam, and I\'d give it a higher rating if it wasn\'t for the \'watery\' consistency when it comes out of the can.  This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).In summary:* If you like foam, you may like this one.  3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won\'t like it.  However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you\'d like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

It was basically because the antiperspirant does not let your pits sweat at all, that they are basically blocking your the sweat glands which can lead to an infection.It may be different for, but for me I sweat easily despite being skinny, and non clinical strength ones do not work as well/barely for sweating. So use at your own risk/are not as often as you would with normal onces, I would advise everyone, from personal experience to not use these at all.

If you want to use the trimmer to do some edging, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. It\'s not powerful enough to do edging. It works fine trimming with each of the combs, but edging is out. My 20 year old Con-air trimmer does better due to more power (2 AA batteries as opposed to 1 AA battery for the styler). And the replacement cartridges prices are insane, although you can get the 6 cartridge replacement from Amazon for cheaper than you can a 4 cartridge replacement at any store. I suggest buying the fusion proglide razor instead of the 3-in-1 trimmer. Not worth the money for the trimmer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

This is a recent problem, but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors.  The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face.  The blue strip degrades after only a few shaves, and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have extremely sensitive skin and every shave usually equates to a miserable bout of rash and irritation. This is the first time I have shaved in years without any problems.The razor is easy to grip and has a very light nick-free action. I got a very smooth shave the first pass (didn\'t have to shave the same spot twice). It worked equally well on my legs and underarms. It rinses effortlessly thanks to the design.The suction cup shower holder did not work on my walls. Irrelevant to me but that might be of interest to others. I\'d definitely seek out and buy this product again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

It\'s no better than the M3 Power razor I have. The difference in closeness of a shave was minimal to nonexistant, more closely bordering the latter I\'m afraid. On top of which, the new head design renders shaving with the grain, or the downstroke, completely useless. And the detail trimmer on the back of the head is dull and useless right out of the packaging.The single improvement this razor has over the last generation is that the handle of the blade is more comfortable in the hand and balanced better. The downstroke is useless, the upstroke is the shave. The total shave is overall the same except that I can\'t use the downstroke at all anymore. And at the jacked up price they\'re pumping out these beauties at, it\'s not worth anything at all. I\'ll stick with my M3 Power. Sorry Gillette.

1925,831,20060521,B000BUW8WM,4,"May 21, 2006",A1V7889Z1SVIVY,Best for every day use.,"I would give this product 5 stars but... it isnt perfect.This is the BEST razor for everyday use.  That means shaving everyday or every other day because you go to work.  Because there is so much more surface area in the blade design it really is a breeze to shave.I have quite senitive skin, and I can now finally shave everyday with out getting cut up.HOWEVER... If you leave your face unshaved for more than 3 days... like a full weekend.  It doesnt shave as well.  The long hairs get caught up in the blades and almost rip out.  The Mach 3 does a much better job at long hairs.  It is possible to shave with the fusion, but it takes a longer time since you have to keep rining it out every inch of a shave.I had this razor since the first day it came out.  The best thing  I have noticed is that each blade lasts about 2 weeks. My Mach 3 usually lasted a week.  ( Like i said i have senstive skin and once the blade starts going, my face gets all cut up. )  So blades are more expensive but they do last longer.Overall.  Best razor every if you need to shave frequently.  If you are a contruction worker or someone that only shaves once or twice a week... I wouldnt recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have the power version and when you turn it on the whole razor buzzes and vibrates just enough that as your shaving your facial hair doesn\'t tug/ pull like so many other razors. I usually shave every day or two but to test this \'gliding\' i wait about a week so the hair would be almost too long for a hand held razor, but to my amazement it still managed to not have any tugging on the hair. This razor also has a single blade for trimming which is good over all but tends to clog up pretty fast. Other than the single blade side clogging its a fantanstic razor and look pretty awesome too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

2036,943,20080411,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 11, 2008",A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,Smoothest Shave Ever,"When Gillette released the Fusion 5 blade razor for men years ago they revolutionized shaving yet again.  Changing the angles of the blades and adding 2 extra, it seemed slightly ridiculous, what was next 15 blades?  But upon using the 5 blade wonder from Gillette I quickly found that the hype was worthwhile and the end result was the greatest shave I had ever gotten.  Smoother, quicker, and with less irritation then I ever had before.  I tried going back to the Mach 3 but it was impossible, the stakes had been raised.  It was only a matter of time before a womens razor with 5 blades would be released, could the magic happen again?You bet it could.Being in martial arts I found the benefits of shaving areas that men don\'t usually shave as opposed to staying hairy all over (go ahead and insert your metro sexual jokes here) and have used a womens razor for years so I know what I am talking about.  With the edition of the lubricant outer edge, the aforementioned 5 blades, a comfortable grip and a shaving station to put your razor back, this newest invention by Gillette truly is a work of art.  Razor burn is a thing of the past and irritation has been sent out to pasture as well.  My wife loves the quality of this new razor and her legs lasted smoother longer.This is one of those cases where once you try you can\'t go back.  The new Venus Embrace is a lights out home run of a product that exceptional.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6051,2359,20110422,B003EMXLIE,3,"April 22, 2011",A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,Best Overpriced Shave you Can Buy,"I must admit that the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power blades give a good shave.  I even bought them.  But, even though I have no financial reasons constraining my purchase of this example of our \'finest\' technology, I think there could be some misplaced priorities in a society that would spend almost $4 for a razor blade for their razor that vibrates while shaving via a little battery propelled motor.  Do we really need this product to satify our need to look so nice, or could we feed a few more people with the same amount?  Or do we buy it simply because it is the best?  Or, perhaps we need to by this product to assure Gillette makes a fat margin after they pay their marketing people who make up an eight word name for this product (if we count the hyphenated word as two)?  I think men should stop shaving until Gillette finds a way to sell these things for less than $2.  The world would not end if we let our beards grow and reduce their sales to next to nothing.  The worst that would probably happen is they would be forced to sell their company at a huge discount from its current value to a buyer who would pay so little for the company that the blades could be sold for an amount significantly less than $2.  Could we even survuve in a world that no longer produces $4 razor blades?  I bought these blades because they are the best available, but I really do not need the best available.  They really do not do anything of value for me.  I just think it is incredible that we have been sold on the idea that we need a smooth shave.  Now we have guys who shave their heads so they will not reveal their natural loss of hair.  And some guys are shaving their bodies because they think their hair is in the wrong place or their girlfriend or boyfriend do not like hair in the \'wrong\' place.  I think our thoughts are in the wrong place.  I believe we all have the right to appear the way we wish.  But I also have the right to chuckle at my self and others who think $4 razor blades are great stuff.  I rated this product with five stars because it works well, but I reduced it to three stars because it is so unnecessary.  While this is an unnecessary product, it has no real objectionable purpose other than its reflection of how we squander our assets at time when we criticize our government for its outrageous spending choices that are driving our country to financial failure.  In conclusion, do we have the moral authority to demand a like reduction in our wasteful government spending while we continue to buy $4 razor blades.  The answer must only be \'Yes\'.  Our government should not have any control of private spending, but the electorate must have total control of government spending via the House of Representatives even with items of insignificant amounts.  Even though this example is related to razor blades which seem insignificant, our government\'s thinking in this regard is they should be spending as little as possible to accomplish a specific purpose and then only when they have determined that the purpose is one that is worthwhile and necessary.  I editted this review only to clarify a point that seemed unclear after I posted it.For those who do not appreciate the social and political commentary, I apologize.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By far the Gillette Proglide is the best safety razor I have ever used and I have been shaving for over 50 years.But, to get the best shave with this razor or in fact, any razor you should follow these simple techniques:1.  Get a shower mirror, not that expensive, and shave in the shower at the end of your routine, make sure water is running and at a pretty good temperature.  The longer you stay in the shower before shaving the softer your beard will be and easier to shave.2.  Get yourself a bottle of Baby Oil, doesn\'t have to be Johnson&Johnson\'s any brand will do, even Walmart\'s brand.  I tried the Baby Oil gel, but it\'s too messy and gooey.  Just plain old Baby Oil.  Step away from the shower and put a good amount of oil on your face and neck. Rub it in as best as you can to make sure your beard is pretty saturated with the oil, you don\'t have to over do it, but just make sure you have enough oil on your face that you know it\'s there.3.  Shaving cream.  So far the best I have found is Aveeno\'s Therapeutic Shaving Gel. Available everywhere just about. Apply the the shaving gel OVER the oil that you put on your face.4.  That\'s it! Shave now like you would normally with your Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor.  You will not believe the closeness of your shave, plus your face is being nourished somewhat when using the Baby Oil.  The oil makes the razor glide smoothly over your face and actually lubricates the shaving blades, MAKING THEM LAST A LOT LONGER THAN IF YOU DID NOT USE THE OIL.Summary:  I change the Gillette Fusion Proglide blades once a month, honest.  Once a month! And I shave about 5 to 6 times a week.  Getting 20 to 25 shaves is nothing using this technique.  I probably could go longer than once a month, but can\'t be too cheap, lol.Hope someone tries this.  The combination of the Baby Oil and using Aveeno\'s shaving cream makes this all work in my opinion.  It\'s not that expensive to try if you already are using the Gillete Fusion Proglide razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

Can we return these, I am not sure. Jury is out not sure i will re-order.Update:My second shave was a struggle, if i want disposable razors i wont pay the premium. I have been using turbos for quite some time and a blade lasted me a moth at the least with 2 shaves a week maybe, I expect 4 shaves at the least from these.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

1890,796,20070531,B000BUW8WM,3,"May 31, 2007",A3NN7V9VV1RD39,Holding out for the 8-blade version,"Here\'s what I think went down in the Gillette Marketing department recently:Marketing Guy #1: Hm, how can we increase razor blade sales for next quarter?Marketing Guy #2: Well, we\'ve been selling 3-blade razors for quite awhile, why not step it up to 4 blades?Marketing Guy #1: Better yet, let\'s go for 5-blade razors!  Then we can charge twice as much for replacement blades.Marketing Guy #2: Perfect.  Any consumer would think that 5 blades is far superior to 3.  Let\'s make the thing vibrate too.. that\'ll really blow their minds.Marketing Guy #1: This also buys us some time for when we decide to release the 8 blade razor.  Helloooo promotion!This thing is a gimmick.  It works just as well at any 3-blade razor I\'ve tried.  In fact, packing 5 blades into such a small space requires you to constantly rinse the razor, making for even longer shaving sessions.  Depending on your skin, you will be more susceptible to razor burn with this razor as well.Overall, this thing doesn\'t do anything better than a 3-blade razor.  So, unless you have a burning desire to try the latest razor and a massive amount of money for replacement blades, stick with your current razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1892,798,20070425,B000BUW8WM,4,"April 25, 2007",A1YFX3KREPTCZ8,Better than I expected,"Before trying this razor, I was using the Mach III (which was a good razor as well, although I never used the Mach III Power); and despite my best efforts not to get sucked into advertising, I decided to try the Fusion Power after seeing the commercials. But now I\'m glad I switched.I only shave every other day, and rarely on weekends, so sometimes I\'ll go 3 or 4 days without shaving. And the Fusion does a great job with the extra growth. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the \'comfort guard\' helps make it a smooth cut. And the power part is a big help; once I\'m done, it\'s a closer shave than the Mach III was. I also have a goatee, and the main blade of the Fusion can actually trim the edges.There are only 2 minor negatives to the Fusion: Cleaning out the comfort guard is a bit of a hassle, and the blue guard makes it hard to see any hair (mine is dark brown) that\'s been caught in it; and the battery indicator is basically useless. It\'s been \'low\' for several weeks, and a brand new battery didn\'t make a difference. So I guess when the razor stops working I\'ll know the battery is dead.Overall, a good step up from a simple razor.Update (11/17/07): It seems I misunderstood the battery indicator, which I apparently didn\'t look at very closely when I bought the razor. I thought the battery symbol on the razor would indicate when the battery was low, and that\'s why I thought it was \'low\' for so long; I didn\'t realize that it was like that all the time! The entire area around the battery symbol and the power button will actually flash orange when the battery is low, as I discovered this week. So I apologize to anyone that might have read my review and was misinformed because of it. And now the only minor negative about the razor is still the issue of cleaning the comfort guard.On the positive side, however, it seems the Fusion will last quite a while on one battery: Mine was still going strong in April when I originally posted this review -- and I had had the razor for some time then -- and despite the fact that I don\'t shave every day, the original battery (which I put back in after a new one didn\'t matter) lasted until now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well they did!  This Turbo brand of Mach 3 is actually much better; his shave lasts longer, the blades last longer, and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave.  I choose this one over that Mach3 power vibrating blade because, I don\'t know, a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion.  Haha...He\'s very happy with it and likes the shave.  And speaking about money, if the shave and blades last longer than before, it\'s a great value!Highly suggested!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
