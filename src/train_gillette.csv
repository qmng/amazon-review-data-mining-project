6425,2736,20110421,B004QE83VE,2,"April 21, 2011",AUITG1DJ3QUGK,"better than many disposables, with some caveats","I have reviewed a number of products which I tried because my teenaged daughter wanted them and I had concerns... and so used myself as a test subject.  In this case, it is somewhat reversed.  She has been using Venus razors for some time; absolutely insists on them to my dismay, as they are a good deal more expensive than any other disposable razor that I am aware of.  So, when the opportunity presented itself I decided to try it and see why she was so wholly sold on the product.I will preface my remarks on this razor by noting that I have so butchered myself with disposable razors in the past that I gave them up entirely for electric (which, I will note, are a good deal better than they used to be).  That said, for me this trial serves several purposes.1. How likely was I (or she) to cut myself with it?2. Did it provide a better shave than an electric?3. how does it compare to other disposables?I put off the test for quite a bit reminiscing on discovering a trail of blood as I left the bathroom (and having sworn the entire routine off years ago).It did pass the crucial first test.  I managed to shave my legs without bloodying myself.  I think the moisturizing pad helped here.  that said, I *really* do not like the moisturizer.  It smells like fabric softener to me :p and does not feel as good as either a real moisturizer (which you would use after you shave) or provide as much glide as other creams or gels.  I found it mildly offensive.  that took a star off.2. Compared to the electric, it was not as easy to use; involved a bit more fussing: insert (or, as one will ultimately have to) changing the blade.  It was a little bit of a closer shave, but also left my legs feeling scraped.... not as good as my skin felt on the leg I did with the electric (knock off one more star).3. Compared to other disposables, it is not any closer per se but may save one pass.  HOWEVER, the blades get much more clogged and are more difficult to clean than twin blade razors.When you think about it, really it is just one blade which is doing the cutting, the second or third is for what you miss on the first pass.Having tried it, do I think it is worth the extra cost?  NO (resoundingly) but sincerely doubt I will be able to reason with her ;)In sum, yes it shaves a bit closer than an electric.  All blade razors do.I found this one to be safer than most (a plus) but did not like the scent or feel of the moisturizer and my skin felt more raw than when I use the electric.I did not find that it provided a closer shave than other disposables, or permanent blade razors, and do find it harder to clean.In my view the positives and negatives more or less balance each other out and what you are left with is a very expensive disposable.  Myself, I will not be buying this product, though doubt my reasoning will have much impact on the shopping habits of my teenager ;)Edited to note that I brought this with me on vacation (more portable than an electric) and a week later have so many ingrown hairs; it\'s awful!  This never happened with any other razor I have used.  I will not be using it again (and will seriously discourage my daughter from same).  Who wants to risk infections or scars?  I don\'t!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With an occasional wet shave with a disposable razor, Now that I DO NOT have to shave every day to please anyone I found the electric shaver just was taking to long and not producing a satisfactory shave and the disposable ones were not much better and were irritating. Did some research and decided on the Proglide Power razor along with some extra blades. I have just treated myself to one of the most smoothest and closest shaves I have EVER experienced.

The razor gives the expected 5-blade smooth shave. I tried it myself -- on my face, sillies! The soft green palette is pleasing to the eye, and the shaped handle has a rubberized grip that makes it easy to grasp when wet. The head is large and contoured, ideal for mowing down wide swaths of follicular profusion. The shower caddy is a neat idea. It is backed by two suction cups for gripping the shower stall (tip: works better when wet) that conceals a small, swing-out storage space for extra blades. The swing gets loose easily, so careful! I can\'t speak about price, but typically, 5-blade replacements are fairly expensive, unlike those for my trusty Trac II.

1900,806,20070113,B000BUW8WM,1,"January 13, 2007",A1KY1EM93SYZVE,Crappy razor.,This razor is actually the most uncomfortable I\'ve ever used. It seems much harder to shave with and pulls at my face more. This is coming from someone who loves the mach 3 in its various forms. I\'m not sure what the problem is. Maybe the blades are too close to each other or something. Maybe trying to cut so many hairs at once is a bad idea. All I know for sure is it\'s not smooth.  It\'s not just a slight difference either. I go back to the mach 3 which I still have and I immediately notice the difference. Maybe others with different beards will have better luck but for me this razor down right sucks. I\'ve given it a fair shake too. I\'m still trying to use up the blades I stupidly bought.  However I can\'t ignore the fact it is far worse.Edit: I want to add one more thing. Whey you first put a new cartage in the razor does a pretty good job. If you tested it for one shave you might think it was good. However it really degrades very quickly. The second day it\'s noticeably worse and it just goes down hill fast after that. Again I am comparing this to a Mach 3 which I can keep for a much (and I mean MUCH) longer time and have it shave pretty good.  There is definitely some technical problem with this razor and I think a lot of people posting good results have a) tested it once b) are shills for Gillette c)  are in denial after spending a lot of cash on it or d) have a beard like a baby\'s butt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

508,518,20100714,B000BUUVTE,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

I used the clickable coupon that was available on Amazon and I think I ended up paying less than $15 for the item because I\'m also a Prime member. The item arrived 2 days later and I was trimming away. I actually enjoyed using the product. It looks and feels like a quality shaver and trimmer. I also like that it is powered by batteries because I use rechargeable batteries. I actually haven\'t used the shaving part of the unit because I really hate shaving. I was able to trim my beard on my neck so closely that it shaving wasn\'t really necessary. Still I\'m impressed with how the razor attaches and vibrates. I\'m sure I\'ll use it eventually, even if just out of curiosity, lol. Love this purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I smeared it intentially on some black cotten clothing, and although I could see the substance, it turned clear not white.As for the rest, on a hot day, and me without an air conditioned car, I came home smelling OK.  I was still dry under the arms, and smelled the scent of the stick (\'Artic Ice\') instead of me.  I don\'t really think this is the smell of ice, artic or not, but it smells pretty good, somewhere between a slight floral, and citrus blend.After that it\'s just like the other sticks out there, the active ingredient in most, Aluminum Chlorohydrate, is a known drying agent, so it helps evaporate sweat before it has a chance to soak you.  Like most of these new sticks, part of the staying power is that they are water resistant, so apply after the shower, not before.  Good stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes to the point where I will sweat through my shirt and that does not look good when you are out in public. It has just been something I have had to live with. I tried other deoderants/anti-perspirants that claim to stop sweating but they never work. So when the chance arose to try Gillette Clinical Strength, I figured I would give it a shot.Well let me say that Gillette has a winner on their hands. This product work and it works well. At first I was little worried because it says to apply at night before bedtime and that you can still take a shower in the morning and need not reapply, unless you want to. Well it turns out that it does work. Turns out that the produxcts does it thing as you are sleeping. Since I have started using it I have no problems with underarm sweating and the scent is very subtle and not overpowering at all. So if you have any doubts about trying this product wait no longer and pick this up now. You will be appy that you did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4140,1520,20111217,B001G7PMV8,5,"December 17, 2011",A375QUNTNORBG5,Gillette Custom Plus Razor are the absolute best for me,"For me, the Gillette Custom Plus Razor is the absolute best and closest shaving razor on the market.  I have tried, bought, or sampled just about everything out there except a straight razor.  I even have a very expensive safety razor \'kit\' I purchased from an internet supplier of shaving supplies.  The most expensive razor felt like I was using a Samurai sword on my face and it simply did not work as well as these Gillette Custom Plus pivoting razors did.  Again, maybe they just work well for \'my face\', i\'m not sure, but these work well for me.  Very comfortable, reasonably priced (about $1.30 a razor), and the longest use I get from a razor before I have to throw them away.  I would dare say (from my experience) that these razors use the exact same \'head\' or \'cartridge\' on them as the Gillette \'Sensor 3\' Razors which also work very well for me.  I always seem to come back to either the Custom Plus or Sensor 3 (both by Gillette) and again I think they use the exact same cartridge on top (triple blade) but they have a different shaped handle.  Thats the only difference between them.  I usually get about 7 to 10 days of shaving with these.  Other disposables give me 3 to 5 days before becoming very dull and unusable for my face.  Make sure you flush the blades out with water and let the razor dry after use for the best result and longest days of use.  Another trick with these (or any razor for that matter) is a high quality shave cream.  I\'m not talking about these \'foams\' or crap like that.  You know what i\'m talking about.  Get yourself a good quality shave cream in a jar and a badger hair brush to apply it with.  I know, some people may think i\'m crazy or something, but trust me on this one.  The badger hair brush (GOOD QUALITY ONE!) may cost you about $35 or up.... in price.  It will last a LONG TIME (years) if you take care of it and shake it out and dry it each day.  A good quality shave cream (such as something from Crabtree & Evelyn or Sephora, or ULTA will set you back between $20 to $30 a jar, tube, or tub but you use very little each day by applying it with the Badger hair brush you purchase and it will last forever trust me.  When I say it will provide you with a super close shave, I mean closer than using a cheap foam or gel.  I was about 40 years old when I finally broke down and bought a good quality Badger brush (after seeing reviews about them on-line) and I was so happy I did it I will never go back to those junk foams or gels that cost $2 at Walmart or similar locations.  You wouldn\'t think it would make that much of a difference, but trust me, IT DOES!!!!!  It just simply makes a difference, period.  Coupled with the Gillette Custom Plus razors and a good quality shave cream and Badger Hair brush, you\'ll have a great shave that is very close, even if you have a coarse beard like mine.  Happy shaving my friends!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I found the razor with a guard to be ineffective. It works for folks who have a significant amount of hair and just want a trim. If you are used to being bare or nearly bare, the razor with a guard is a waste of money.

I shaved one side of my face with the new Fusion power razor and the other with a Mach 3 Turbo. I had a day and a half stubble, which is my toughest shave (after that my beard soften). The shaves were nearly identical. The Mach 3 might have been a little smoother but the Fusion might have shaved a little closer. The Fusion\'s straight edge single blade was helpful with my sideburns. Both give great, close, smooth shaves but I couldn\'t see the advantage of one vs. the other. Since M3 is much cheaper, why switch?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have two, one in my shower and one in my travel bag. Now there\'s a disposable Venus, though, and I am thrilled! It shaves just as cleanly and easily as my Venus Divine. I love having a disposable with the built-in moisturizing strips so that I don\'t have to carry shaving gel or rely on hotel soap or shampoo. I don\'t often like scented products -- I like to choose my own scents -- but the scent of the moisturizing strips/gel bars is subtle and unobtrusive. The Venus Breeze is lightweight and easy to use in the shower. Its handle is lightly textured and easy to hold and I had no problems with it slipping during use in the shower. Thanks, Gillette!I look forward to buying more of these when they are available on Amazon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1691,592,20080120,B000BUUVTY,3,"January 20, 2008",A2D6FKD1SIWA0P,Feel like I\'m being hornswoggled,"Did you ever spend $20 on something wondering if it even does what it says on the box?  That\'s how I feel about this product.I wonder if the extra blades even do anything useful during my shave.  But the real question here is whether the \'power\' part of this product differentiates it at all from the non-\'power\' version.  Really, what\'s the difference?  I couldn\'t tell any during my shave.But...  Compared to the Schick multi-blade razors, the Fusion is incredibly better.  The wire that holds in the Schick blades makes for not as close a shave.  The Fusion\'s extra single blade is a great innovation, something they should consider for their single-blade model.Still, this all leaves me wondering if I shouldn\'t just get my own straight razor and avoid this monthly razor tax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have purchased the refills faithfully and only used something different (Quattro) when I was traveling because I have a travel case for the other razor.I shave my face and head.  I use Gillette shave gel just as I have for years.On to the Proglide:I have never understood the point of a power razor that was not an electric razor.  Now that I have used a power razor, I still don\'t get it.  I have a hard time telling where the razor is on my head with the vibration activated.The blade has not lasted nearly as long as the original fusion blades.  I do not know what has changed, but after just two weeks of shaving, I look like a cat has gotten ahold of my head with his claws extended.  The original blades would last at least a month, but not so with this new blade.  I also do not get nearly the quality shave that I get with the original blades.I would save my money on this razor and go for the original fusion or even the quattro.  I got it for free in their promotion and my head wishes I had missed the link on Twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4446,1836,20110907,B003983HRI,4,"September 7, 2011",A10ALLOIU0S093,Smooth Cutting,"Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn\'t provide a cover for the blade area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
507,517,20100714,B000BUUVTE,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has gel strips along the sides to prevent cuts, and lubricate without shaving cream.  The razor also smells really good.  The package was also very easy to open, and did not take the jaws of life to open which is rare among razors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonaligned razors that fell to pieces after the second shave.  When you first get your package all goes well.  Check out your razor after your second shave.  PURE JUNK!

Just like driving an automatic car for the first time, you can\'t feel everything in the road, but no effort is needed for a smooth gentle ride.  Been using this Fusion system for a few months now and my skin is clear from gentle smooth shaves.  These replacement blades are a little more costly, shop around you can find deals.

It gives a clean, smooth shave with no nicks or cuts with minimal passage over the legs.  Unlike double blade or even triple blade razors that I\'ve use in the past, a single well placed passage led to a smooth, hair-free path.  The \'Ribbon of Moisture\' also works well to get a smooth finish. I personally love the shower pod that protects the razor from sitting in moisture and reduces the chances of rusting.  I really enjoyed using this product and will definitely use it again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I leg-gasm just thinking about it).Pros:1. Compact.  They fit in my travel case better than any of the other Venus blades.2. The moisturizing strip IS sufficient for dry-shaving.3. Has considerable longevity.  With intermediate use, one cartridge lasts like 3 weeks.Cons:1. Way too easy to razor burn.  I have to be super careful by making short, well lubricated strokes.  It\'s just too much effort.2. Doesn\'t give a dynamic shave, but that shouldn\'t be surprising.3.  Because of the short, choppy strokes that are necessary because of the blades\' epic crappiness, it\'s too easy to get cut.  I\'m tired of chopping up my knees and ankles.Moral of the story...

6175,2484,20091128,B004B8AZH0,4,"November 28, 2009",A3KZ7OH4VRL048,Great for everyday shaving needs,"I am quite picky about my razor blades, since my neck can be cut by a razor pretty easily. The Fusion  has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days\' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

26,26,20120301,B000052YHS,5,"March 1, 2012",A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,I keep coming back to the Mach3,"I\'ve tried many razors over the years including various electrics, and when I don\'t have a beard I always come back to the Mach3. The Mach3 was introduced by Gillette in 1998, and while I don\'t remember exactly when I bought a Mach3 set (or \'system,\' i.e., a handle and two blades), it was probably in 1998 or 1999. Since then I\'ve gone through a number of blades but have never replaced the handle, because I haven\'t had to.I have a pretty tough beard and have to shave daily if I want (or feel obliged) to look clean shaven.According to the current Wikipedia entry for the Mach3, the blades cost 9 cents to produce. I\'ve read conflicting stories about the history of disposable razor blades and I\'m not sure what to believe. But it seems to me that disposable razor blades and cartridge type blades in particular, like printer inks, are high profit margin items that deserve to be characterized as ripoffs. I recently tried using old fashioned double edge razors, the kind I stated with when I started shaving in the last sixties - I not only have my own old double-edge blade holder but have two even older ones that I inherited from my late dad - but as has always been my experience, I could not get through a shave without an annoying cut or two (and then I end up going out with little pieces of bloody tissue stuck to my face). If I thought I could get a clean, bloodless shave with a straight razor I\'d go that route. Electric razors can be okay in a pinch but it takes too much time and effort for me to get a really clean shave with an electric, and even then it\'s never as clean as the shave I can get with a Mach3. (I discovered Aveeno shave gel a few years ago and though I don\'t have sensitive skin, I\'ve found that it works better for me than any other gel or cream I\'ve used.)Obviously, not all guys have as good an experience with the Mach3 as I\'ve had, and that makes sense, because every guy\'s beard and skin is different.When I have more than a couple of day\'s growth, I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It comes with a sort of gelskin on the top of the razor and the bottom of the razor which in turn made it very easy to shave with.  Very little shaving cream or soap was needed once this gel was wet.The only think I didn\'t really like was the fact that the gelskin was a bit fat, as in I don\'t think the razor shaved as close as it could have had the gelskin been just a tad bit flatter.I have since bought four more blades for this razor simply because I like how my skin is softer after using it.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1960,866,20110226,B000I4YA72,5,"February 26, 2011",A1P01CXG168NQJ,Finally found a good one!,"I checked out all of the reviews on ear thermometers before buying this one, figuring I could just return it to the retailer if it didn\'t work. I was using a pharmacy brand rectal thermometer with my 15 month old son and it would always give us vastly different readings every time, up to a 2 degree difference, and I wanted something that was ACCURATE. As long as it was, I was willing to spend more.I was not disappointed with this. I knew my son was running a temperature by his temperament and feeling his forehead. The rectal thermometer read 103.1, 102.4, and 101.9 when taken three consecutive times. Right out of the package the Braun ear thermometer read 101.6, 101.6, 101.5, 101.5. I took mine and it read as 98.8, 98.5, 98.5. MUCH better than my old thermometer and it took a fraction of the time. Not to mention it\'s much easier to get than a rectal temp, and I look forward to seeing just how easy that will be when we need to use it in the middle of the night!No, the screen doesn\'t light up for night time use. Oh well. If the thermometer remains this easy to use and maintains its accuracy, then I think I can easily deal with that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1748,649,20091118,B000BUUVTY,1,"November 18, 2009",A1JU7JR6O3Y3OD,Nice PR above my Review Dont buy these blades,These do have serial numbers yet shave nothing like the same ones I buy at local retailers where I live. Just got off the phone with Amazon no problem getting refund and getting free shipping label to send back. Yet will never buy razor blades from any store online again. Dont have the time to do the research if they are knock offs or no I just know from my experience with the ones from Amazon that they are way to sharp and cut up my neck and face even though I first wet my face with hot water then wait a couple minutes for shaving cream to settle into skin and shave the exact way I always do which never caused cuts with the blades I buy locally. Who knows whats up I will stick to buying my razor blades from the local retailers.Update: I contacted Amazon about this product. I hate to do this but because these are fakes I told them they will be shipped to Proctor and Gamble\'s counterfeit department for inspection. The reason I am doing this is because first of all the fake blades I received give a painful shave and I just cant allow fellow buyers to be deceived the way I was. So hopefully Amazon will either sell real ones or Procter and Gamble will peruse legal action. The bottom line is buyers like myself would gladly pay the couple extra dollars you would at Wal Mart rather then be deceived and being sold fake blades. And yes Amazon did refund my money but the procedure when you receive a counterfeit product is not to return it to the merchant first you should contact the company who makes the actual product then local and state attorney departments and the better business beuero. If I wanted fake razor blades I would have purchased them off of Ebay. Grow up Amazon and quit trying to trick people!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two \'shave gel bars\' do the job nicely, providing just enough lather to smooth your shave. The green tea scent fades pretty quickly (after a few uses), but that wasn\'t a concern.I\'ve used other Venus razors before, and my favorite is still the 5-blade Venus Embrace. But the Spa-Breeze, seems to be a less expensive and even \'Green\' alternative, thanks to the fact that I can use it without shave cream.The 5-blade embrace does deliver a slightly closer shave, but I\'d still say the Spa Breeze is worth a try if you\'re not \'addicted\' to a 5-blade razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

2222,1131,20110416,B000XVTYYY,5,"April 16, 2011",AC4Z26E60FBEM,"Great, Smooth Shave but a Little Pricey","For years and years I used some variation of the Gillette Trac 2.  These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.I don\'t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it\'s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I\'ve never had any problems with the handle, and I\'ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.There may be better razors or blades out there, but I\'m content enough with the Mach 3 that I\'ve stocked up on enough to last me for years!If these are inferior knockoffs, I guess I just haven\'t noticed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Has sharpness of the Mach 3 with the trimmer of the Fusion,"The Fusion Proglide is Gillette\'s best razor since the Mach 3.I thought the Fusion was a big step back for Gillette.  They increased the number of blades, but used cheaper and duller blades, so the end result was a lot of grabbing and pulling on my skin, something I never experienced with the Mach 3.  The construction was also cheap, I had a Fusion break apart on me after a year.  I\'ve never had a Mach 3 break, over 10+ years of use.The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  But the trimmer would get clogged with hairs, which is annoying.The Fusion Proglide replaces the Fusion\'s dull blades with sharp blades that don\'t tug or pull on my skin, they just glide through and cut as they\'re supposed to.  Plus, this keeps the trimmer while improving it\'s design to allow hairs to wash away without clogging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s a nice entry -- it gives a nice shave with no nicks or cuts, and it\'s attractive. It even comes with a cute \'showerpod\' that attaches to your shower wall and holds the razor.However, there are several downsides to the Embrace:* The razors don\'t last long at ALL. I shaved my legs twice without replacing the head, and the second time was really not that satisfactory. In addition, the refills are PRICEY! They end up being over $2 apiece at the Amazon price or more than $3 apiece at the regular retail price.* The multiple blades trap longer hairs, so if it\'s been more than a couple of days since you\'ve last shaved your legs (so sue me -- it\'s not exactly shorts weather in Michigan right now!), you\'ll find yourself CONSTANTLY rinsing out the head. This gets old very, very fast.I think I\'ll be sticking with my trusty old Mach3.

1868,773,20080814,B000BUW8WM,2,"August 14, 2008",A3JBHBU9ANVTIJ,DECENT at best.,"Truth be told, the shave isn\'t horrific. It gets reasonably close and is pretty smooth until you find it is time to replace the cartridge. This is where you hit a brick wall. $26.00 for a pack of cartridges is really one of the more ludacris ideas I\'ve heard in a while. I get just as good a shave with a Bic disposable single blade so five blades really isn\'t better. Hell, THREE blades is unecessary (and two can be downright painful). I have purchased a Mercur safety razor which I think will hold me over for a good forty years as it is a tried and true antiquity, is a single blade, and the said blades cost like a buck for ten at Longs (standard double edge). Horrendous value cartridge-wise and not really a terribly good shave to boot. I really should probably have given it a one star, but hey, it works. If you\'re under eighteen, wait \'till they send you a free promotional one (they most likely will). If you\'re over, I highly recomend you stray from this series. If you like Gillette, get the Good Ol\' Mach tres. Or, go smart, frugal (and coincidentally eco friendly), and purchase a safety razor.  Good hunting.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

Through trial and error, plus reading advice online and in magazines, I\'ve come to the conclusion that two blades actually give a better shave than the blades with 3,4,or 5 blades (and probably by the time you read this they\'ll be up to 6, if they\'re not already).  It\'s all just marketing.  These blades do the job, and they don\'t tear up your skin as badly.  Plus, buying these blades on Amazon makes buying slightly more affordable. Because let\'s face it, Gillette is taking us for a ride with their mach line of blades, paying Derek Jeter and friends millions to convince us more blades is better.  The proof is in the results, and my wallet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1828,731,20060222,B000BUW8WM,3,"February 22, 2006",A243PHL8H4Q25,Gillette Fusion The Best Way a Company can Get you to shell out $45!,"I was skeptical about this product from the moment I saw it. I purchased a M3 Power razor about a year ago and had little complaint with it, the biggest complaint I had was that the button on the handle was in a bad position, mainly the space that I like to grip the handle.Unfortunately, it seems, the new generation of Gillette suffers from even more problems than the previous generation. The button is still in that same godforsaken place. On top of that, the downstroke, or rather, the stroke with the grain is almost completely worthless. I will admit, it didn\'t grab the stubble or tear at my face, and it was a smooth stroke, exactly like the previous generation, but it left a horrendous amount of stubble. The cause of this I believe to be the huge blue buffer pad on the bottom edge of the blade. Even the new blade on the back end of the razor is practically useless. It cuts even worse than the ones on the front.The only positive thing I can say about this is the redesign of the handle. Unlike the M3 Power, you can use your index finger up higher on the handle if you so choose to but your continuously pressing against it and bumping the button.My conclusion would have to be that this is a subpar razor for a radically outragous price. $14 for the Razor, $14 for 4 replacements, and $30+ after tax for 8 replacements. It seems like Gillette was more concerned about getting as much money out of your pockets as they could than they were about designing a better razor. I will be returning to using the M3 Power, if only to save myself time whilst shaving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6059,2367,20100920,B003EMXLIE,3,"September 20, 2010",A2V3LLHHLNZ9OA,"Shaves okay, but way expensive.  Try DE Shaving!!","I\'ve used each new version of the Gillette series since I started shaving.  (my first razor was the Gillette Sensor)I do believe this gives me the best shave from Gillette since I started using their cartridge razors.  The problem is that with each new razor comes a price increase.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor cartridges sells for $3.50-$4.00 per cartridge...Ouch!!  Thinking for years that buying the 4 and 8 pack refills was a rip-off, I looked into DE shaving.  I bought an old Gillette Super Speed safety razor and a sample pack Double Edge razor blades and started learning the proper way to shave.  A little math now...at $3.50/cartridge for Gillette Fusion I will spend $182.00/year for razors.  I can\'t use them for more than a week.  In fact the proglide razor seems to lose performance after the 3rd shave for me, but I push it to 6 shaves.  I can buy a 100 pack of Astra DE razor blades for $15.75.  That\'s (rounded up) $.16/razor.  I can use them for 1 week also, so I spend $8.32/year for DE razors.  After a couple month of learning to shave with a DE razor I\'m now getting the same (if not better) results than I get with the Fusion Pro Glide.  The only advantage that the Fusion ProGlide has over old school DE razors is that it is a little quicker, but $173.68 per year in savings is enough to get me off the cartridge razor bandwagon, and into the Double Edge Razor bandwagon.  To me it\'s just common sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mom bought me a pack of these at a local drugstore MONTHS ago and I\'m still only on my second blade.  During the winter I usually only shave my armpits daily, and since my leg hair doesn\'t grow much in the winter anyway, I only shave them once every week or so.  The small amount of use has probably contributed to keeping the razor clean and sharp.  I leave it in the shower everyday, but I always make sure it stays on a shelf where no water accumulates, so that probably helps too.The moisturizing strip has long since been depleted, but I really don\'t notice a difference in the shave.I usually hold the razor near the bottom and rest my middle finger lightly on top of the actual razor part, because it seems like if I don\'t, it won\'t have enough pressure to get every nook and cranny.  It\'s not really a design flaw; I like it because it gives me a lot more control over the pressure.  The flexible head is AMAZING.  If you\'ve always used cheap one-piece disposables, you are missing out.  I have probably only gotten cut once or twice with this razor (around the ankles--mostly my fault for not being careful enough), when I used to get razor burn and cuts EVERY SHAVE with non-flexible one-piece razors.I strongly suggest you buy these.  This particular package is a great deal at about $3.66/razor (as of 4/2/12).  Honestly I wanted to just buy replacement cartridges, but this package is actually a better deal!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

2061,968,20080405,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 5, 2008",A2386P602G9547,Wow! I\'m impressed,"A razor is a razor--but this one actually made me want to shave. Ladies, you know how it is, after a couple of decades, shaving your legs becomes a chore to dread. The Venus Embrace has eased that chore for me. I\'ve used Venus products for several years, but this one is miles ahead of past versions, and it does everything it claims to do.Yes, it is comfortable to hold--rather like those pens with the soft rubbery stuff on the outside. I think it makes the razor less slippery in your hand as well. That\'s important in the shower especially. The holder is oddly shaped, but there are no hinges to open or to break. Time will tell if that open design is a good thing or not. It did fit well and unobtrusively in my cramped shower. I loved the suction cups though as opposed to the old sticky stuff.The most important thing, however, is the actual results from using the Venus Embrace. Here, it really shined. Smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I deliberately made only one pass to see how well the product worked. Perfect! One pass was all that was needed; my legs were smooth, hair-free, and without a single nick or scrape. There was a slight scrape on my underarm, but that could have been user error. How long that moisture strip lasts has to be determined over time, but so far, I love this razor. It\'s my new product of choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I use this because the shave is quite acceptable and the price is considerably cheaper. There is a cut off point below this blade. Once you try this, you will realize that razor blades sold less expensively than this one are greatly more uncomfortable, do not give a shave in any way as good as this blade. There are better blades than this, but the difference is only in small increments superior.  This blade offers a shave that is better by a great magnitude than any of those less expensive.Thought they may honest and well meaning people, I suspect many of the folks that are saying that these blades are fakes are shills for a retail seller that does not like having the mark up reduced, but who knows? I am,as I write, about to reorder some now after having burned through a very satisfactory 24 pack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scent is light and doesn\'t clash with my perfume. It holds very well but doesn\'t make my hair sticky or stiff. Even if you get caught in the rain once your hair is dry you can still get a brush through it easily. It\'s a classic. I just love Adorn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1818,721,20060321,B000BUW8WM,2,"March 21, 2006",A3PE2ASRMWCDST,Too many blades! More of a scalpel than a razor!,"I like everything about this razor! Design, power indicator, its power which seems to be more powerful than the M3, the aloe strip and the extra blade on the back of it! BUT, this thing has one blade too many in the front, this razor WILL CUT YOU if you are not careful! You could probably kill someone with it! The blades on the cartridges are extremely sharp and shaving time increases to over twice the time as with the Gillette M3, due to that extra fourth blade and the size of the cartridge, which forces you to be extra careful and shave very slowly, so as not to cut yourself. If it only had one less blade in the front, it would certainly be the best razor in the world! Gillette, if you are reading this, consider this advise seriously and remove that fourth blade, because you created one hell of a scalpel. I am rating it two stars, despite the many pluses already mentioned, but since its primary and only purpose is to shave, I cannot honestly say it does a good job. I\'ve used disposable razors that are about $0.49 cents that are faster and better. I do not recommend it, unless they remove that fourth blade. I do recommend the M3 Nitro from Gillete as well and which is the one I am now using.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

The Fusion is a little bigger than the M3 and is comfortable to hold. Just wish that the blades were less expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All those gimmicky razors flat out suck.  This sensor excel line of razors shaves my dark facial hair closer than anything I have ever used ever, and I don\'t even feel it.  It feels like I\'m standing in the shower just wiping the shaving cream off my face.  Forget your 27 blade tool and get this...my girlfriend uses it more than I do and it\'s still sharp as a comedian after a couple of months.  Stop wasting your money on crappy gimmicks with batteries and get the real deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1664,564,20061125,B000BUUVTE,5,"November 25, 2006",A1DZ0ATGUNGWFV,"Great shave, long lasting blades","I have been using the SensorExcel for several years and thought I was happy. I received the Gillette Fusion as a free promo and decided to try it. The initial sensation of having 5 blades scrape across my face was a bit unsettling (I imagined a layer of skin being shaved off) but the results were startling. Very close and comfortable shave -- only the beard was removed, not the skin. Single blade on the reverse side works fine for trimming sideburns and under the nose. I used the first blade for 22 shaves and did not nick myself once. I could only get 6-7 shaves out of a Sensor blade so, for me, the high price for Fusion blades is justified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s a smooth shave, and with any shaving cream/gel, it feels like running thick water down your cheek. I\'ve had mine for over a motnth now, and its still sharp, so i don\'t know about the other review. Maybe its the way i shave. I always wash out the blade after each use, so it probably won\'t dull as fast as if you don\'t. But overall, I\'m not sure if it\'s worth the extra for the vibration, it\'s not that great, and I don\'t use it as much. But for certain people, it might be better than for me.

It holds well in all weather conditions, allows you to comb through hair that has been sprayed and then continues to hold.  It doesn\'t leave a residue on my hair or dry it out.  The fragrance is very nice and clean, not overpowering. Since I frequently suffer from migraine headaches, many hairspray fragrances seem to trigger a headache, but not this one.  Additionally, I\'ve never known it to conflict with any perfume/cologne I may wear.  I have used this spray for over 30 years and will continue to use it as long as Amazon carries it.  I\'ve tried to use more readily available sprays from grocery and beauty supply stores but they just don\'t compare.

5820,2125,20100526,B003987CL0,4,"May 26, 2010",A1004703RC79J9,A Step Up,"I received this razor from the Vine program.  I\'ve used the previous Fusion Power razors in the past with great results.  The cartridges are expensive, so I\'ve alternated between the Fusion and a Merkur safety razor with Feather blades.  When I want a really close shave and don\'t have a lot of time to spend shaving, I opt for the Fusion.  It requires less preparation time for my beard and I don\'t have to be nearly as careful while shaving.  Also, typically one pass does the job with the Fusion.As for the new model, the Proglide, there are improvements.  They\'ve created better spacing between the blades to help keep the razor from clogging.  I think this also improves drying, which should lengthen the life of the blades.  I don\'t care how much, or what kind of coating they put on the blades, they will eventually rust.  It seems also that the trim blade is improved.  It\'s very handy for getting the tight spots, like right under your nose.  That\'s a problem area with a safety razor and certainly with a Mach 3.  All in all, this is a great razor and one that I would use every day if the replacement blades weren\'t so expensive.  I\'ll keep this puppy in the rotation, especially for travel and those times when I don\'t have much time on my hands.Recommended, but only 4 stars because of the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It should last another 2 or 3 weeks probably, but I was hoping for more after reading other reviews.

Criticisms:1. Five blades are ridiculously wide.  It\'s hard to accurately shave the narrow area between my lip and nose.  Using these to square-up my sideburns is like using an axe.2. The proximity of the blades to each other causes rapid build-up of shavings, requiring more frequent rinsing. You pretty much have to rinse the head after each row. Very tedious.3. Even this bloodthirsty capitalist grows weary of Gillette\'s program of forced obsolescence.  I was perfectly happy with the Mach 3 system; now you can\'t even find the blades.  Before that it was Sensor; Atra; ad infinitum.  Does the human face keep changing?  Maybe in another million years.

It rolls on like any other deodorant, and smells very pleasant.  Wearing it throughout the day kept me dry and odor-free, doing exactly what it should do.  It rolls on clear and does not run at all which is very comfortable.  Lastly, there was zero residue in my shirt, which is a great advantage to this product.  I would absolutely reccomend this doedorant to people who plan on being active as it seemed to have a very strong drying presence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4412,1800,20120403,B003983HRI,3,"April 3, 2012",A21N3CFERVUT0I,Less Than Impressed,"I bought this razor 3 days ago and first shaved with it with about 36 hours of growth. I\'m a 5-6 day a week shaver, so pretty regular. And I will also say I H-A-T-E shaving. Man\'s face was never meant to have a sharp object ran across it to take hair off. That\'s what I believe.For all the talk of these razors having a smooth shave, I\'m not that impressed. It feels different than the Mach 3s I\'ve been using since the late 90s, when they came out. Probably because it\'s a wider surface moving across my face. The features of my facial hair are: Relatively fine, not thick, but tough. And along my neck the hair grows in at least 3 different directions making shaving that much more frustrating. I will also add there is a spot along the left side of my larger than average chin that consistently gets missed. I must run the blade over it at least 3 times, and by that third time, my face has had enough and is quite irritated. I don\'t believe I had that problem with the Mach 3s.I posted a comparison shot of this razor (they are placed upside down relative to the camera, too). The one on the left is after 3 uses. The right has not been used. Notice the glide strip appearing on the bottom-it\'s half gone! I don\'t know if the metal will last the weeks I\'ve been reading about, but that strip isn\'t going to! I don\'t anticipate having a anything near a smooth shave if I let those blades touch my face a few more times, not based on my years of experience.AND...I must also note that I have well water that is VERY hard. You can see the calcium build-up on the sides. I believe that probably shortens the life of any razor.I don\'t doubt the guys who say they have gotten good use from this blade. I haven\'t, and likely won\'t, so I will eat the 10 bucks I spent and go back to my Mach 3s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

2022,929,20120424,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 24, 2012",AAYJA4GME03V6,Not Ready to Make the Embrace,"I was able to try this cartridge when buying a refill package for my Venus Divine. Like all other variants, you can swap the razor blade and handles, which is convenient. The Embrace blade head has a large design. It\'s still more narrow than say, the Hydro Silk, to you\'ll ultimately need to make more passes because of the narrow path. However, the larger head didn\'t seem to impede shaving very much. I did notice that it tended to bend the wrong way when I was shaving from certain angles, which causes it to drag over my skin. I expected some irritation from it, but nothing happened. It feels a little weird when that happens, but there\'s no lasting effects.I get as good a shave from this as my Venus Divine, which I have always liked. This one has added an extra blade, but I\'m not sure if the shave is that much closer. This design is supposed to be more moisturizing, however. This is due to a large moisturizing strip that surrounds the blades themselves. I noticed that it felt, well, slimier upon first use. The moisture quickly dried up, however. Whenever I step into the shower to use this after leaving it sit, it gets a little moist once again, but it doesn\'t last. In my opinion, I wouldn\'t count on using this without shaving cream for any area other than under your arms.With that said, I\'m not ready to switch over from my Venus Divine. This works well enough but it doesn\'t work any better for me to justify the price increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the Proglide I can confidently shave at a pace that is about 4 times faster without nick concerns.  The floating blades so effectively follow the contours of my skin that I get as close as shave as I ever have before.  The benefit of the power micro-vibrating effect is the blade cuts while it \'floats\' over the skin.  It is a great combination to safely cut against the grain in places where I dared not take my double edge razor.  Total time for a wet shave with three passes was about 10 minutes and this was the first time I\'ve used it.  I would expect it to be about 5-7 minutes next time.In defense of double edges, they still remain the best performance/price ratio of any disposable razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I loved that it came with a replacement head and that it had a storage rack with suction cups, so it could be placed out of the reach of children.  The razor itself had a great \'soft\' grip and a nice wide moisture strip.  But...... the Cons --The wide \'face\' on this razor kept it from delivering a close shave even though there were 5 blades.  When I used it on my legs I found that it didn\'t get REALLY close, although it was very maneuverable.  When my husband tried it, he found the same thing, plus the wide head meant that it really couldn\'t be easily used as a man\'s razor because there were places it just wouldn\'t go-- like under the nose.Still... the Pros --Where this razor absolutely excelled was the \'nick\' test.  I found that no matter how fast I shaved my legs I never came close to cutting myself, even around the knee.  In fact, I am so impressed with this razor that I called my sister to recommend that she get it for my nieces who are just getting to the age where they will soon be shaving.I think this is an ideal razor for shaving newbies.Pam T~",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I compared it to the Mach 3 and this is what I\'ve determined:PROS:1. Very close, smooth shave. It is noticably closer than the Mach 3.2. Less pulling than the Mach 3.3. Razor handle has a nicer and more expensive \'feel\' to it. It has a little heft, so to speak.CONCERNS / ISSUES:1. The razors are materially more expensive than the Mach 3. It\'s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money. If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I\'d go with this one.2. The razors are thinner. I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.3. Amazon has great info and instructions. The razor itself does not. It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box. For example, I really wasn\'t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head. I might have appreciated some of the features more if I had understood what they were for and that is not always obvious from the packaging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

I have very sensitive skin in my mustache area so I always had a problem with cuts or it would tug at my facial hears and cause pain.  So much so that I switched to electric razor for the past 5 years.  But with electric, it was frustrating because I could never get the satisfying shave a blade can get me.After seeing all the advertisements for the Proglide I couldn\'t resist so I decided to try it out.  I put on some shaving cream and tried this bad boy out and it sent chills up my spine as I glided this thing across my sides and chin.  I even went against the grain and it was just so smooth.  Now for the ultimate test.... I grimaced as I anticipated pain as I was about to shave my mustache area and I couldn\'t believe how it just cut away at all my hairs.  And immediately I went against the grain and no cuts, not tugs, nothing.  It felt like licking ice cream.  I have not had my face so bare and smooth like this ever.

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

4253,1635,20090427,B001JQLNFA,5,"April 27, 2009",A1XFNGJ2BMGKAZ,Smoothest Shave I\'ve ever had,I love Gillette Venus razors and have always used them.  This Spa Breeze Razor is exceptional.  It\'s worth the price yet I wish it wasn\'t so high.  I can get quite a few good shaves out of one cartridge if well maintained.  It left my legs very silky smooth.  It didn\'t even feel like I was using a razor.  It felt more like it was gliding on my skin.  This is absolutely a good razor to buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And just because I used it a few times doesn\'t mean anything.I am an avid Mach3 user, and I have been for years, ever since I was sent one for free on my 18th birthday. But this 5-razored Venus is shaking my complacency up. Something that I had taken for granted for so long, that the Mach3 was the be all-end all of razors, might no longer be true. When I used the Venus razor, it felt like it was wiping hair away. And I have a very thick beard. I have to go over an area twice, at least, after my Mach3 razor is on its first or second use.  The Venus created no problems at all, even after several uses. There was no irritation, no cuts, and nothing missed. Just total, smooth comfort. It was amazing, in its own way, how it squeegeed the hair off in one swipe.So is this the end? Is 5 the magic number? Are we good enough now? I think so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The blades are now up to a perhaps ridiculous row of five - I didn\'t notice that they shave any closer.  As a matter of fact, they seemed to do a slightly worse job than my 3-blade Venus.The biggest change - and the reason I won\'t be changing to this version - is the moisturizing pad around the blades.  My skin felt slick and greasy after I used the razor, not a feeling I enjoy!For a woman who shaves in the shower daily, this could be a wonderful innovation...but it isn\'t my style, so I\'ll stick to the regular 3-blade Venus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have a rubber strip to imitate the lubricant strip.5) Blades are misaligned causing cuts on my face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here\'s what she has to say about it:\'This razor is really smooth. It does a great job shaving, as it gets all the hair with one stroke and feels much nicer than the other razors I\'ve tried. It never cuts me. A strip underneath the blades applies a moisturizer, which keeps the razor from nicking me.

Gilette finally addressed that in the Proglide. These do not jam and shave very well. Also, as you may have seen in the ads, you can shave against the grain, as I have to do to get a close shave, and it is quite smooth. My only complaints are that they do not last long (three shaves are usually the max, maybe four, I do have to shave against the grain so each shave is almost like two but the sensors with this usage lasted longer) and they are pricey and the price keeps rising.

I usually shave every day or two but to test this \'gliding\' i wait about a week so the hair would be almost too long for a hand held razor, but to my amazement it still managed to not have any tugging on the hair. This razor also has a single blade for trimming which is good over all but tends to clog up pretty fast. Other than the single blade side clogging its a fantanstic razor and look pretty awesome too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4382,1768,20090601,B0028K3IZY,5,"June 1, 2009",A6T1RHMQ9NSE4,Clean and Fresh Without The Mess!,"I received this item about a week ago and like most new hygiene/beauty products, I tested it immediately.  This product has a fresh, clean masculine scent.  The scent is mild though.  Not over-powering at all.  So, if you are a man that wears a cologne, this definitely will not mix with it.It doesn\'t flake or clump.  I also noticed that when you put it on your skin it doesn\'t have that sticky or wet feeling.  It goes on smooth and once on, you can\'t even tell you\'re wearing it!The deodorant DOES NOT wipe off on your clothing. Even though the solid is white, it goes on clear. After having this over a week now, several shirts have been worn in differt colors and types.  The colors ranged from dark to light and the types were anything from a button down to a pull-over.  No residue or white marks could be seen on any of the shirts and most importantly, there was no sign of wetness all day!Gillette has always been a name to trust when it comes to shaving and antipersperant products! I would definitely recommend this product to any man looking for a clean, masculine scent that isn\'t over-powering, but will keep you dry all day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5 razors there do a good job in removing hair fast.  However, it\'s not necessarily best in giving the closest shave.If you are not a natural \'gorilla\' like myself (moderately thick beard), then this large clumsy unwieldly razor won\'t do much, will cost more, and won\'t even give you the best shave.Truth be told, how many of the 5 razors make a real difference, 3?

I thought maybe one out of my box of 12 might have been dull, so I tried another razor.  Unfortunately, that one had the same problem.These razors work, but they could be better.  They wear out much faster than I expected and they don\'t give me the close shave I want, but they sell at a decent price.

I\'ve been using the Trac II since I started shaving, about 30 or so years ago. I\'ve used every other razor there is--and there are other razors that do shave a little closer--but not for the cost of the Trac II. That\'s why it still exists after 40 years.I\'ve also tried imitations of the TracII (Personna, Walgreens, etc.), but none measure up. They tend to pull more and are not as smooth. But some seem to work for some people and they may work for you and could save you money. You just have to try them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2169,1078,20080416,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 16, 2008",A16IM9MYTHCKYQ,Lots of cute features make the Venus Embrace \'cutting edge\',"The first thing that shows some thought went into the new Venus Embrace is the packaging.  You don\'t need a set of safe cracking tools to open the plastic wrapping - there\'s a perforation for easy opening!  At last!Next you\'ll notice the storage pod that holds the razor and two spare cartridges.  The pod attaches to the wall with a couple of suction cups.  (Much nicer than the adhesive strips some manufacturers want you to use to attach their products to your walls!)  The pod is cute, but I don\'t stick things to the walls - so my pod and extra cartridges are going into a drawer.The main event is the razor itself.  The gel handle is very comfortable and the razor feels well balanced in the hand.  The head is wider than usual - a good feature when shaving the legs, may be kind of dicey on the underarms.  Another nice feature is the moisture strip which increases the glide factor on the skin, although it doesn\'t entirely eliminate the need for shaving gel or foam.The razor head shaves close and doesn\'t nick - at least the first time you use it.  The actual blades are on the thin / flimsy side, so you\'ll be changing the cartridge with above average frequency.  I don\'t know that a five blade head shaves any better / closer / faster than three blades, or two, or even one - but a five blade head does seem to clog up up more and faster than the others.  You\'ll be interrupting your shave quite a bit for rinsing and tapping.In summary, there are lots of cute features - the pod, the gel handle, the extra wide head and moisture strip.  The five blade head looks impressive, but the blades are flimsy and clog up five times as fast as a single blade.  Three and a half stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to take a chance as these were being shipped and sold by Amazon so I figured that if I received fakes I would just return them as returns are pretty simple with Amazon.Well, my razors arrived and they were indeed genuine Gillette razor blades. My shave was smooth and nick free and the blades stayed sharp for several shaves. I included some pics of the product packaging so people can compare the product they are receiving to the ones I got. I have ordered Mach 3 blades from Ebay in the past and received horrible razors packaged in what looked like official packaging but made out of cardboard instead of the plastic that the retail ones come one. Perhaps that is an indication of counterfeits?I am very pleased with this purchase and will certainly be ordering more.

I have used high end brands like Clinique. I used an organic brand, the name of which I do not remember because it was a long time ago, that gave me a rash. I have even used a lower priced brand like Barbasol. In the end I can say that every one allowed me to shave well. The Hydra Gel that I am currently use really allows the blades of my Fusion razor to smoothly glide over my face. Another plus is that I only use a drop. I drop the size of a dime is plenty to generate a nice lather on one side of my face. So, basically, 3 dime size gel drop will get the whole face covered in a great lather. One can should last me a couple of months I assume. If I use too much my face tends to be left with kind of a film on it from the gel. It comes off easily but you really need to wash your face thoroughly.Less is better.My face has a close shave, no rashes, no bumps. It is a wonderful product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Mach3 is the only razor I buy as it will last about two weeks per blade.  I used to use throw-away razors that cut my face and made my neck break out.  I\'ve never had a problem since with Gillette.  One of the fins has a blue indicator strip that tells you when its time to switch blades as it starts to fade.  The other fin has a lubricator on it.  It took me years to find something this good that works.

These blades are not as sharp from the start and only last 2 or 3 shaves compared to 10 or more for the ones I buy from Walmart, Target, or Sam\'s. The lube strip also wears out with the first shave. I have been told that these blades are made in Europe where the steel quality is poor and the manufacturing process is not as exacting. Do not buy these blades on Amazon, period.

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

They work great, no burn, cut great, last a long time, etc, etc, etc.  I have no real complaints other than they are pricey.  I can make do, because I shave about 2-3 times a week.  I am not super harry but I am not exactly a peach either.  At this point I can\'t see any reason to go to another razor.  Buy these with Amazon\'s ship program (where they ship them every so often) and get a discount.

This handy little shaver actually took away the hair without giving me razor burn that people could see visibly from across an eight-lane highway.

The only thing I don\'t understand is the single blade they put on the back, I tried using it for it\'s intended purpose of killing your mustache but it was not doing anything.

	5	""July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

I perspire normally, so I didn\'t need major protection. The claims of be shirt friendly and going on cleanly are also accurate. I don\'t understand the reviews that claim the product leaves a flaky white residue -- I imagine those reviewers are just using too much product. In my experience, if you use the suggested amount then you won\'t have residue.My biggest gripe with this product is the smell. It\'s way too strong. If you don\'t wear cologne or perfume, then it might not be an issue for you, but this product will definitely clash with other scents. Depending on what you wear, it could even overpower other scents. For me, this is a big issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

4421,1810,20100721,B003983HRI,3,"July 21, 2010",A2V1BKESGGFESJ,"Good razor, but still a bit rougher than I\'m used to","I will say that this is a good razor, but I am still searching for the perfect razor.  I will also say that my beard typically comes in patchy and the hair on my face is usually pretty coarse.  Everyone\'s face is different and this should be taken into consideration.  This razor feels very comfortable in my hand and perhaps even lighter than most razors.  Traditionally, I have shyed away from Gillette razors as they have a tendency to provide a more painful shave for me.  There seems to be more tugging and pulling then other razors I have used.  I have always found that a Schick Titanium typically gives me a more comfortable shave.  The Proglide is no exception as I still found it to be pulling a bit much to my disappointment.  I also noticed a bit more irritation on my face the next day, but nothing too bad.  However, I will say that this is, by far, the closest shave I have ever had with any razor.  I believe I actually said \'wow\' when I was done shaving.  In my mind I had to determine what the trade off was.  More comfortable versus closest shave.  For now, I am sticking with the Gillette in hopes that my face gets a little more used to it.I knocked off two stars for the following reasons:1) Price!  The razor is not too expensive, but a 4 pack of blades is about $16 at my local gorcery store.  By far, the most expensive blades in the aisle.2) Lack of comfort...it tugs and pulls a bit...and left my face slightly irritated.Overall, its a good razor.  It\'s not quite a comfortable as the Schick I used, but I am pretty darn excited at how close the shave is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brilliant!Well, I can not remember the last time I actually CUT myself with a razor until this razor came along.  Twice in transitioning from my neck to chin I have managed to drag the trimmer blade across my chin laying it open the entire width of the blade!  Not a nick, mind you, but a freakin\' wound!

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

For years (since about age 15 - I\'m 42 now) I\'ve found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it\'s simply a \'clean\' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don\'t find it competing with my perfume and haven\'t noticed it to be overpowering.Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.The product isn\'t invisible and will get on your clothes if you\'re not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can\'t find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about \'pitting out\' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was also concerned about getting razor burn.  Both of my fears were alleviated once I used the Gilette Venus Proskin Moisturerich Razor.  It literally cut my shaving time in half!  I\'m a big fan and a convert.  I would recommend trying it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,56,20050809,B000052YHS,5,"August 9, 2005",ANFFZACV670CB,gillette really are the best a man can get (and women),"After a long shall we say \'experiment\' of trying a fair few shaving systems, gilletes\' range of mach 3, mach 3 turbo and m3 power razors seem to do the job best. other straight razors, disposables/non disposables, either felt too dangerous or clogged up easily, or the razors simply had a lack of variety with the design which gets boring if you have to use that razor evey day. so i got a rather expensive philishave (norelco in the states) which was incredibly close but it missed bits when used as instructed not to mention made my neck feel and look like someone has rubbed mild acid onto it, even after 4 weeks use on the \'sensitive\' setting. All types of mach 3\'s produce an equal shave which is at the same time, close and the blades clean out well under a hot tap. but the overriding factor that made me come back to them was the 7 variaties of handle to choose from, so now i can have a different razor for every day of the week which overall makes shaving everyday more tolerable. i dont personally believe in the micro-pulses of the m3 power but the vibrations themselves must enhance the the performance somehow. if your thinking of buying one of the mach 3\'s then go for it, as you won\'t be dissapointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fancier ones not only cost more but they are mostly useless when the moisture bar runs out, even if the blades are still sharp. Just use decent shaving lotion and you should have no problems with this razor. Sometimes simpler is better.I normally buy these at the store, but they were cheaper on amazon so I now purchase them here.I am giving it 4 stars, although it is better than the $18-22 price in stores, the $16 price on amazon is still way to high for the product. Although I can\'t say how much Gillette charges for companies to buy these, I would say $10 is a fair price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The handle design is just right, the pivoting head is designed to glide over your skin. It\'s so light, it\'s hard to get nicks and cuts with this. The 5 blades that literally glides over your skin. I had been using three. The handle is made of a gel material that allows it to stay in your hand even when wet. I reviewed another brand a few years ago and one thing the company forgot about is what happens when the plastic gets wet... you can\'t hold on to it. Not so with this razor. No problem at all in that department. It also comes with a \'shower pod\' that has suction come attachments to keep everything where you need it... in the shower. This is the razor that I have been waiting for. It will be super easy to pack it and take it with me for my next vacation! You are going to love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know that Gillette has made great razors in the past so I bought it.  The design, I would give it 5 stars however, the single blade trimmer is not all that effective and like many of the reviews above it is very difficult to clean.  The five blades however did not run as smoothly across my face.  Yes it gave me an incredibly close shave the first couple of tries but on the third day i felt that I was sawing at my face and having to do multiple strokes in areas just to cut the whiskers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOT sold by \'So & So\' and \'Fulfilled\' by Amazon - not good. Unfortunately these 3rd party sellers are selling fake blades - the ones everybody\'s complaining about - the same ones you\'ll find all over e-bay.I\'m ashamed to say I\'ve been using the fake (knock-off, counterfeit) blades for a couple of years. I had a hunch that either something was wrong or Gillette wasn\'t consistent with their product. Because some blades were better than others, some just didn\'t feel right from the start, and none of them lasted all that long. So this time around when I went looking to purchase new shaving materials I heard all this talk about phony blades and it all made sense. Those bums definitely made a fool out of me with their slick packaging, because they certainly \'look\' like real authentic Gillette replacement blades but they aren\'t.And now that I\'ve once again shaved my head with a REAL Gillette Mach 3 Turbo blade purchased from a reputable retailer (Amazon) I now realize what I have been missing - a smooth, close, effortless shave which doesn\'t tear me up. And to my surprise the lubricating feature on the Turbo actually works! A great product.One more word of advice - keep your eye on the price of this item as it fluctuates often! Keep it in your shopping cart and buy when the price drops. I paid $1.83 per blade. Great deal.Once again... ships and sold by Amazon...

But I discovered I could get just as quick a shave with some body lotion, and a regular razor.  In either case, the razor cannot be gripped too firmly because your leg IS going to hurt with a dry shave.  The lotion comes out of this razor on the second leg, and never in any quantity to be any help.For a quick shave, try some body lotion and a regular razor, but only if you have a little hair, and remember to lightly press.UPDATE:  It seems to work fine as long as you keep the razor totally satured with warm water and make sure you use a light touch.  I also put lotion on my leg before shaving because of the bad stinging that happened once after shaving.Works for a quick shave if you\'re not looking for perfection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1671,571,20060905,B000BUUVTE,2,"September 5, 2006",A3J6GVLYFFCVGB,Not for thick beards,"Let\'s get this straight from the beginning:  I hate shaving.  I have a very thick beard that grows very fast -- if I shave first thing in the morning, I actually need a shave again by 5 o\'clock.  And I have to go over every area at least twice to get a close shave.  I spend an inordinate amount of time doing something that I hate.  So, I will gladly try any new product that promises to make shaving a bit easier.With five blades, the Fusion looked to be the holy grail of shaving.  I\'ve been using a Mach 3 for years, and it works better than just about anything else (though my Panasonic linear electric is great in its own right).  I figured if three blades are good, five should be better.  Right?Well, unfortunately not.  The five blades on the Fusion are on a head about the same size as the Mach 3, which only has three blades.  This means the blades on the Fusion are much closer together, which Gillette says will give you a closer shave.  This might be true for average beards, but if you have a thick beard, the blades are actually TOO close together.  I find that the Fusion just kind of skips over my whiskers without cutting, especially if I shave with the grain.  So, I actually have to spend a longer time shaving with the Fusion than I did with the Mach 3, and I have to go against the grain more often.  I\'ve switched back to the Mach 3.However, one thing I really do like on the Fusion is the single blade on the back.  That is really excellent for shaving those hard to reach areas under the nose, and for straightening out sideburns.  I just hope they come out with a Fusion Platinum Edition or something, with a bigger razor head that spreads the blades out a bit more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4185,1565,20090705,B001G7PMW2,5,"July 5, 2009",A2Q6EAO1SH7EPG,Tried almost everything else,"I tried every new razor Gillette introduced over the years from Trac II, Trac II Plus, Atra, Sensor, et. al.  Each one was better than the previous one. However when they started with the 3 and 5 blades I said \'enough already\'.  I finally tried them as samples, but drew the line at the vibrating one.  The Sensor Excel is really the best. The problem is it got so expensive, in a large part because the 5 blade razors were hugely expensive and Gillette/P&G couldn\'t have an old product that worked so well so much cheaper.  At least with Amazon\'s auto ship it makes the blades reasonable.  Perhaps the crowd at P&G are responsible for these ridiculous new models out now with 6 blades (5 for the face and 1 for under the nose).  If the Sensor Excel is ever discontinued, I\'ll have to try safety razor I guess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The little vibrating action of the battery powered handle really made a huge difference in how easy it was to shave, and the razor glided right through thick stubble with no problem at all.  The thinner blades didn\'t clog up and washed out pretty easy (which was a HUGE complaint about my older Fusion), and after using it for a few weeks, the blade is duller but not as nick happy as I thought it would be.So while the hype is still pretty big, I was surprised at how genuinely good this razor ended up being.The bad part?  Well, this thing is EXPENSIVE.  The handle is affordable, but you\'re paying $22 for 6 refills.  Thats unbelievable!  Especially since I can get 5 blades for a dollar with my safety razor.All in all, its a great razor, but its super expensive to buy cartridges.  If you can afford it, you\'ll like it.  But I\'ll probably just stick to my safety razor, since it offers a super cheap shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shave gel lasts MUCH longer than the shave bar on the Intuition.  The Spa Breeze also takes up less space in the shower and for storing the cartridges.  The only place I\'ve cut myself with the Spa Breeze is around my knees, and frankly that\'s just a common nick zone for me so I can\'t blame the razor when I do it with others as well.  The price here on Amazon with Subscribe & Save makes it cheaper than going to Wal-Mart to get the 4-pack replacement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1700,601,20070612,B000BUUVTY,5,"June 12, 2007",A1TTUR3TU0YFDG,A Mach 3 user who was a reluctant to change,"I used a Mach 3 for years and was satisfied. I was reluctant to try the  fusion, but a sample was included with my morning paper delivery a year ago, who would have thought to include it with the paper?Anyway, after using the first razor and cartridge, the closeness of the shave was incredible! I used it for almost 3 months before having to bite the bullet and buy cartridges.The shave from this razor is incredibly close, with no irritation. My beard grows every which way, leading to some discomfort with single or twin blade cartridges. This shaver, while refills can be expensive, provided a closeness in the shave I have never experienced before.I have achieved a longer use per refill, partly I think, because I do not use a traditional shave cream. I use \'Kiss my Face\' shave cream, which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge, while also providing a better and closer shave, with far less irritation.If you use this, try different shave creams, and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses. This will help to lengthen the life of the cartridges.One caveat... my beard is not thick, and I do sport a goatee, which may also help with longevity of cartridges. I currently use one cartridge every six weeks or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

I bought these and they absolutely do not work as well as the real thing. The first thing I noticed was a broken seal on the package. The first cartridge broke in half when removing from the holder. The worst part is that the shaves are terrible. It feels like shaving with a tweezers. It is my opinion that anyone buying these will get ripped off. This is my first rip off when buying through Amazon so I will continue to use them.Note: I previously obtained Gillette Fusion Cartridges through Amazon from DAB and they were fine. These came from toponeenterprise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1661,561,20061220,B000BUUVTE,3,"December 20, 2006",AFO6FV7G060UM,Is this the right razor for me?,"I have been using an electric razor for many years and have gotten extreemly poor result for some time now.  I finally switched to a manual razor.PG\'s Gilette sent me both the Fusion and the Mach 3 free, so I tried them both.  I think P&G\'s Gilette is trying to confuse me.  I like the Mach 3 better than the fusion becasue:1) smaller head makes it easier to get into those small places, true the fusion does have the one rear blade for this prupose but the head was so large that I was not able to get the blade into those hard places.  The Mach 3 was able to get the whole head into most of the small places which certainly beats getting just the one blade in there.2) While the Fusion\'s handle was well balanced so was the Mach 3\'s handle and the Mach 3 had better gripping surface then the Fusion did.3) Lower price on the Mach 3, IMHO, means that the Mach does not need to beat the Fusion just get close to it.  In my test the Mach 3 did better than the Fusion.In terms of the question that I posed in my title, as with everything else in life which is better for you depends on what type of beard you have.  Do you have a heavy beard and have to shave multiple times a day(like Tip O\'Niel) or are you a teen, then the Fusion is probably the best thing for you.  Do you have a moderate beard?  The the Mach 3 is probably more what you need.  Or if you have a light one that does not grow very fast, like mine, then the Sensor or the Sensor Excell is more of what you need.  I think that I am going to go for the Mach 3.I stuck with the electric razors for years thinking that the manual razors would nick and irritate my face.  The may have been true thirty years ago but not now.  Electric razors don\'t give you anywhere near as close a shave as a manual does.As for shaving gell goes, save your dollars and buy the Barbasoll brand.  Costs less and is much better than the Gillete Fusion gells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amazingly, she decared this to be a terrific item and even used the word \'great\'.

A nice, close shave, without any dragging or pulling or scraping, and no nicks or cuts.  Wetting the razor produces a gentle, creamy lotion, not greasy or unpleasant.  It rinses off skin easily.  I was very pleased, and I can highly recommend this razor.It also comes with a little suction holder that you can put on the shower wall, which I really appreciate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I need a deodorant that will go on dry and comfortable, but one that will also go on clear, and not stain darker clothing.With their Clear Shield line, Gillette does just that.To put it simply, Gillette\'s product gets the job done. It goes on dry and clear, and gives long-lasting odor protection that lasts all day. I put this on every morning before work, and several hours later when I get home, it\'s still working for me.If there\'s one negative (and from what I can tell, other reviewers will back me up on this), it\'s that the scent is a bit too \'sweet.\' It\'s almost as if Gillette was trying to create a product men and women alike could comfortably use - and in that aspect, the end result is questionable. They really need to get more scents out, and specific ones for men and women, not one that\'s just a compromise.Negatives considered, this is still a top-notch product.

One would think that I wouldn\'t balk at having to replace these Gillette cartridges, but their price just does not justify their performance.I started shaving using the Gillette Sensor Excel when I was a teenager.  I upgraded to the Gillette Mach3 when it came out, and I was pretty happy with the results.  Now, after a year of using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide, I\'m going back to the Mach3.The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide does provide a close shave.  It\'s the closest I\'ve ever had, to be honest.  The problem is that the blades get too dull to use within a week.  Oh, I could still use them, but then I\'d be tugging at hair instead of cutting through the hair.  My Mach3\'s cartridges would last three months before hitting the waste basket.  And the vibrating mechanism doesn\'t do a lick of good, either.  I have had just as good of results when leaving the battery powered vibrator off.Now, if I could afford to spend $100 a year on razor cartridges, I would stick with the Pro Glide.

	5	""May 20, 2010",A12DQZKRKTNF5E,"Works well, smells good;  for men and women","I\'ve had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I\'m 42 now) I\'ve found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it\'s simply a \'clean\' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don\'t find it competing with my perfume and haven\'t noticed it to be overpowering.Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.The product isn\'t invisible and will get on your clothes if you\'re not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can\'t find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about \'pitting out\' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think I will do that for the fact that although I do really like these new blades, they are high in cost compared to the M3 I normally use.  I do like the way the blades are set neatly in the plactic molded container so you just retrieve them by sticking the handle in, hearing the click and then pulling it out.  The others I use have the plastic tabs you have to break off and then shake the blade out.  I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade.  It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill.  I did like the ones I bought to try, but will not buy more until they come down in price.  It is hard to justify spending that much money on these blades when a lot less money and a steady hand can still produce the same result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2081,990,20080330,B000XVSNTQ,5,"March 30, 2008",A13700AF4X40YG,Smooth Glide and Close Shave,"When the razor blade manufacturers finally wised up and designed a razor specifically for women, I converted to the Venus.  But I\'ve been ignoring the latest generation of razor blades because it seems the price has increased with each additional blade and innovation. While I don\'t want to have hairy legs or underarms, I\'m also economical and was skeptical over whether there would be enough difference in the results to justify the cost.  OK, so I\'m cheap - but life is expensive.The moving action of the blade reminded me of a Swiffer.  You don\'t have to put much pressure on the handle for the blade head to respond.  I initially thought the oversized blade might make it hard to stay with my leg, but it actually seemed to help. Despite the fact that the size of the razor blades themselves is probably about the same as the old Venus or another brand, it seemed like it took less time to shave my legs - maybe due to the fact the blade gripped my leg and I didn\'t have to keep going back to where I left off.I have to confess that the results of the Venus Embrace Razor may make it worth the increased cost - at least for those times when your legs or underarms are on display - like at the beach.  I felt as if I got a closer, smoother result with no nicks or scrapes than I have been getting from my 3 blade Venus razor, darn it all!  It\'s a great product, but I\'ll probably only buy for use during summer months; until I win the lottery, the $24.99 for 8 cartridges/blades is too expensive for everyday use no matter how much I like them.Update:  05/10/08 - I\'m afraid to say that having used the Embrace razor blades, I have now been ruined for the others.  I returned to my former blades and there was simply no comparison.  I thought maybe it was my imagination, but when I bought more Embrace razors, I found to my horror that they were every bit as good as I\'d remembered.  Save yourself if you want to avoid this expensive addiction and don\'t try them.  I have no doubt that if you do, you\'ll find them every bit as good as I have and won\'t want to shave with anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

Since I have a unisex name,  I occasionally get men\'s products. Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it. I\'ve never used a razor with the vibrating feature on it before, but I found this great for my legs, especially my knees and ankles. I\'ve NEVER cut myself using this blade, because with the vibration turned on, it\'s pretty much impossible for me to press down too hard. It doesn\'t vibrate too much to where it\'s noisy or annoying.As far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth. I can go 2-3 days between shaves, and when my hair starts to regrow, the hair is finer and not as \'stubbly.\' I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I\'ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus. I also love that this works so well on my underarms. Because it\'s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I\'ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before. This shaves super close without cutting or razor burn. And my legs are smooth ALL day, even if I shave at 8 in the morning. They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night. Ladies, you know what I\'m talking about.I haven\'t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy. The blades seem to last a while, at least 3-4 weeks shaving every other day or so. However, when they go dull, they go dull quickly.The only things I didn\'t like about this razor: one, it didn\'t come with a blade refill, like every other razor I\'ve ever bought, so that was kind of annoying. Also, the refills are expensive. Don\'t buy the \'power\' refills if you don\'t use the trimmer- that\'s the only difference between the \'power\' blades and the \'manual\' blades, and there\'s a dollar difference between the two. I don\'t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out that it\'s just an exposed blade on the opposite side, but I can see how men might find it useful.Overall, this is my favorite razor. I bought the refills even though they were expensive, and will probably be sticking with this for a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

I thought it was the aluminum chlorohydrate, so I avoided all deodorants with that ingredient. But this Clear Shield product has it in it but does not irritate my skin, so either I\'ve changed or it was because of other ingredients in Right Guard. At any rate, it works for me. I actually like this deodorant a lot. It has a pleasant but not strong fragrance, it has a soft, powder-like texture but is not chalky and it seems to last. I think they got it right. I\'ll probably buy another stick after this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had no complaints with the last razor, but I was in need of new blades and figured I might as well get the latest and greatest.  I have both versions of this razor, power and regular.  The power version makes for a very irritation free shave.  I have the power one at work and the normal version at home.  I find myself waiting until I get to work to shave to have less irritation.  I don\'t notice and closeness difference between the two.  Both shave very close.

May I recommend Gillette\'s \'Good News Pivot Plus with Lubrastrip\' 12 pack for 50 cents each.  And there\'s a guy selling Platinum double-edge blades on ebay for fifteen cents.  A lot of people think these things are better than the Fusion /or/ the Pivot.  Lots of hype, but Gillette has gone backwards in the past fifty years in my opinion.  I will say one thing: the Pivot Plus is a marvel of plastics technology and quality control.  It gives a pretty good shave, but not as good as the double-edges I used as a kid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6122,2430,20101017,B004B8AZH0,2,"October 17, 2010",ARP7M5J4MTTXX,OUCH!!!,"I\'ve read some reviews questioning if these are genuine Gillette Fusion razors, and I have to admit I am also leary.  The packaging looks legitimate, and was sealed.  The razors themselves looked cheaply made, and the blades were not very well aligned.  Some protrude further from others, and this was definitely noticeable when shaving with them.  I\'ve also read reports from anonymous Gillette factory employees hinting that the refill razors are of lower quality than the blades included in the complete razor package.  I guess the goal it to impress you with the starter pack with a comfortable shave and blades that last weeks, then make the money off you with the pricey refills of lower quality that require more frequent replacement.  I don\'t know whether this is evidence of that theory, or if these blades are not authentic.Either way, I was not impressed with these blades.  The pull the hair out of my face and leave painful irritation and red bumps.  Up until this point I have been picking up the $4 Pro Glide razors with 2 blades included.  I had no problems getting a comfortable shave with the Pro Glide package, but haven\'t tried the Pro Glide refills either.My suggestion is to avoid these alltogether, and perhaps try the Pro Glide refills.  Or skip all the chance, and continue stocking up on $4 Pro Glide razors when they go on sale here at Amazon every couple months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

These turbo blades combined with a good shaving gel last me around 2-3 months before I HAVE to replace it. Now after a couple of weeks they don\'t shave as effortlessly as fresh out of the box but I am a frugal person and don\'t like to waste money. The important thing to me is that if I shave in the morning I don\'t want a shadow in the evening. These blades do that. I often go the weekend without shaving so on Monday the blade has alot of work to do and after 2-3 months it can still handle it. With this schedule this shaving system isn\'t expensive at all-less than $1/month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can only compare it to other Gillette razors, but this is by far their best.  I was fine with my old regular Fusion, but this you cannot even feel the hairs being cut, and gets my face super smooth. I still get minor razor burn on my neck sometimes, but I can\'t imagine another big-brand-name razor like this being this smooth.

He recommended I either shave with an electric razor (which he said I would need to do at least 3 times a day) or grow a beard. He wanted me to stop shaving with a razor because of how often I was cutting myself.I\'m glad to say that is not an issue with the Proglide blades. One thing I appreciate about them is that Gillette improved upon the lubricating strips -- they really do make a difference for me and make the shave smoother. I get a smooth shave and do not cut myself.I also appreciate the Amazon subscription service. These blades are ridiculously expensive at the grocery store: I\'ve seen them charge $18 for four blades! With the Amazon subscription service I get 8 blades for less than $25. Still pricey, but I can live with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had an old Mach 3 razor, it was good but I needed a new razor.The design of this razor is amazing. The wieght of the Fusion is pretty similar to the Mach 3, unless you have the battery powered one, then I guess it would be heavier. I thought, \'5 blades? Are you kidding me...when will it end?\' But I swear to you this razor cuts better than any 3 blade razor I\'ve ever used. I also thought that the small razor on the back of the Fusion was pointless, but I was wrong. The small razor is great for side burns and getting small places like under your lip and under your nose.I only nicked myself once, but WOW this is a great razor. I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

461,471,20060317,B000BUUVTE,1,"March 17, 2006",A37QP02Z1EUWXM,Avoid this latest entry in the razor-blade arms race,"This razor was a huge disappointment for me.  Ironically, the Fusion is particularly bad at the two things it is advertised as being particularly good at: close, comfortable shaving, and shaving hard-to-reach places.The blades are terrible.  Right out of the box, the blades caught on my beard and made it painful to shave.  It felt as if the razor was very dull.  I switched blades after two shaves and the replacement was just as bad.  Comparitively, the Mach 3 blades feel great for as many as 10 uses for me.  Not comfortable at all, and because of the pain, I couldn\'t shave as close.As for using this razor to shave hard to reach areas, they must be kidding!  Compare the size of the Mach 3 with the Fusion.  If the Mach 3 is a tight-cornering sports car, the Fusion is a school bus.  To accomodate the five blades the razor pad is so large it\'s difficult to share accurately. And the \'trim\' blade on the back is simply dangerous - the placement makes it much more likely to cut your fiinger, but the plastic on either end of the blade itself makes it unlikely to shave your beard.Not worth the money.  The blades arms race should end now and these guys should focus on sharper, harder, razor blades and simpler razor design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

More blades, more power, and whatever else their powerful marketing machine is able to drum up.  However, coming from the standard Fusion line, I can\'t believe the difference this razor makes.  Maybe it\'s the vibration, maybe it IS the thinner blades, but whatever it is, it works.My beard is very coarse and grows like a caveman.  I can be completely smooth in the morning and by 7:00 at night, my face feels like sandpaper.  Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  The ProGlide is like butter.  Easily lumberjacking the thousands of mini pine trees that decorate my face.  This is my first experience with a \'powered\' razor.  I\'ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  Perhaps this is the reason the ProGlide feels to smooth.  Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  My face stays smooth ALL DAY.  I do have to shave the next morning, but if I wanted to, I could go into work (like I did today) with a minor sandpaper face.  However there is a cost for all of this handsomeness and it\'s the cost of those blades.  $3.30/each from Costco.  That\'s outrageous, but my wife does love a smooth face and I can\'t deny her that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lady schick is fine, but not much movement in the head and the shave is thus sometimes not as close as I\'d like. I also tried the Venus with the moisture bars, and that was kind of messy and not really a fit for what I was looking for.Here is what I was looking for and what I found with this Venus Embrace:I want a plain razor, I don\'t want soapy little moisture bars around my blade (one of the previous Venus razor\'s I tried).I want a head that can move with the contours of my body-hey, an armpit is not an easy thing to shave if the head has limited mobility, right?I would love a place to store the cartridges, and with this model the shower caddy opens to keep my spare cartridge-great idea!  Now I don\'t have to rummage around soapy and dripping to find a replacement in the drawer when my blade is dull- it is right there and ready to go!I like something easy to grip.  This razor is slim and sleek and has a nice indent for my thumb and has a sturdy gel grip.I want a razor that gives me a nice shave-this one does it.  Nice and close.The looks of the unit?  Well, not that important if it is good, but this one also has a good design, dual colored in green and glue, with a cute little circular shower caddy.I think it is a good value and I will definitely be ordering refills and keeping this one as my primary razor.I think this one does it all, it is simple, well designed, gives a great shave and has a pleasant design.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I was quite surprised that after two weeks using the Proglide that I have to say it does indeed provide a better shave than the previously mentioned model. I\'m not sure it it\'s the thinner blades that seem to offer much less resistance both against the grain as well as with it, or one of the other features. The power version also has a feature that claims to guide the hairs in straighter for a more close, even cut. While I\'m not sure if this is a gimmick or not, the proof seems to be in the proverbial pudding. For me, the shaves have been much better with less irritaion, and so far the blades seem to last longer than the old version. On the older version I could only get three good shaves at the most before feeling it was time to replace them. With the proglide I only have had to change the blades once in two weeks, and the performance has always been fantastic. Of course, these statements are just my \'two cents\' worth, as shaving is very subjective and there are so many factors that go in to a great shave. But for my purposes, this new Proglide seems to fit the bill very nicely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

I am a female and love this razor for my legs and underarms!  I received mine in the mail as a promotion about a year ago, and am still on the original blade!  I often use my Remington electric shaver, but when I want a really smooth, close shave that lasts almost a week, I use my Gillette Fusion.  So, while I\'ve had it a year, I\'ve probably used it a couple dozen times and the blade is just now starting to dull.  I agree with others that the trimmer on the reverse side is a gimmick, especially for a female who doesn\'t shave sideburns or nose hair.  My only complaint, like many other users of the Gillette Fusion, is the cost of replacement cartridges.  Thankfully, one or two cartridges will last me a very long time!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Arctic Ice Gillette Clear Shield deodorant has a decent fragrance, but I can\'t say how well it works since I won\'t try anti-perspirants. The packaging is pretty nice, what you\'d expect from a major company. Who knows, maybe they\'ve discovered chemicals that are non-irritating.

The Fusion does not irritate my skin nor do I get a razor burn with it as I do other brands since I have very sensitive skin. This blade system is so precise I can even dry shave if it is the first use of the blade when I am in a hurry and that would not be possible with any other razor I have ever used, after the first use the blades do dull a bit and I have to use shaving cream or I can get shave burn. The only con I can think of is that they can be a bit pricey if you buy the singles so I would suggest that you either buy the biggest multi pack available to save the most.Update- still the best but I have found an electric shaver that finally gets close to the smoothness, Norelco 3D 1290.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

351,360,20080313,B000277P5E,2,"March 13, 2008",A2QMXIFIVE4LNS,"Cheaply made, mediocre, and overpriced.","Mediocre and Overpriced, March 13, 2008By  supernatural (Illinois) - See all my reviewsUnfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems. It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It prevents razor burn as well as pulling and tugging.  With this design, it is not necessary to use shaving cream or soap for a lubricant.The downside of these razors is that there is no guard so when they get wet, the lotion bars fall off before they are all used up.

4232,1614,20090520,B001JQLNFA,5,"May 20, 2009",A13700AF4X40YG,"Expensive, but Effective","I am a huge fan of the Venus razors and frankly didn\'t really see how they could improve upon the version I was using.  So it came as some surprise that this latest generation really did up the ante a bit from a performance standpoint.  Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven\'t so much as gotten a nick.  I\'ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  While I haven\'t attempted to use the razor without shaving cream, as the claims say you can (I have dry/sensitive skin that I feared would not react well), I will say that I think the skin of my legs gets less dry with this razor and I almost didn\'t need body lotion afterward.The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  The razor comes with a case that I believe is intended to adhere to the wall of your shower, with storage for razor blades, which come individually packaged.  I don\'t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can\'t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.The only downside - and one that isn\'t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.  If only you could use the blade to shave the price!  That said, this product is so good that if you\'re trying to select between comparably priced razors/blades from competitors, I strongly recommend you try this one - I think you\'ll be pleased in every way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2136,1045,20080515,B000XVSNTQ,4,"May 15, 2008",A2GCVTKDDOKRRX,"Good, but ....","The Venus Embrace is a good razor.  I got a smooth shave without nicks and I found the semi-solid handle to be ingenious.The five blades, on the other hand, seem a bit like overkill.  I shaved one leg with the five bladed Venus Embrace and another leg with my three bladed plain old Venus and I honestly did not notice a difference.  Both were smooth at the start without nicks, and both grew back at about the same rate.  I\'m of the opinion that the quality of your shave depends more on the quality of the blade than simply the number of blades.If you\'re looking to get this razor just for it\'s five blades, I can\'t say it\'s worth the cost.  As a razor, it\'s great, but it\'s not better than a three-blade as far as I\'m concerned.However, the semi-solid handle may be worth it.  It\'s comfortable to hold and use and moves with you to some extent.  It gets in the tight places better than other razors and helps to keep you from pressing too hard against your skin as you go.As for me, I\'m keeping my Venus Embrace handle and buying whatever cartridges are least expensive when I go shopping.  With four kids, I find the Venus Breeze cartridges to suit my short shower needs best.  Those and the Embrace handle are a great fit for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The handle has a nice weight and grip that makes it easy to maneuver.The fact that the heads are packaged in plastic and foil make it easy to keep a spare one in the shower.  I\'m forever forgetting to change it long after the blades have gone dull.  The extra packaging while nice for my forgetfulness does not appear to be recyclable and therefore just some extra waste.The \'Shower Pod\' is a nice idea since many newer razors are too wide for most razor holders. -- Now if I can convince it to stay stuck to the side of the shower I\'d be even happier.Overall a great razor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

I have a heavy beard and have carried a slight shadow for most of my adult life (particularly in the afternoons).  No more.  I was initially skeptical about the abundance of gadgets here - five(!) blades, a battery, a single \'trimming\' blade, lubri-strips, and who knows what else, but this thing really, really works.  I do not understand the purpose of the vibrating feature, but to my surprise it doesn\'t cut me to ribbons, and does indeed seem to have the effect of cutting closer.  There is no substitute for the right shave cream (I use a product called King of Shaves), but the lubricating strip on the Fusion adds quite a bit of \'slick\' on its own.  I have never had a closer shave, and cannot imagine one.  I have had professional straight razor shaves at that barber, and have come home to let the Fusion finish the job.  Yes, the razors are \'price of oil\' expensive, but I find that they last a loooooong time (maybe 2 weeks out of each?), and actually improve with use (they work better with a little seasoning).  I also own a Schick Quattro by the way, and the Gillette smokes it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s a shaving system, it shaves hair, what else do you need to know?  hahahahaha..I\'m just kidding!I would have to disagree with some of the other reveiwers on this.  Yes it does state you need to change blades every time the blue strip goes away.  But to be honest with you theres no way your blue strip goes away that quick to where it would require 10 times a month!  you must be shaving your whole body, legs, arms and face!  i shave my face daily, and if i went off of the blue strips then i would be stupid!  because my blue strips last longer then what i feel is the life span of one of these blades.  i go through about 2 blades a month and each blade ive thrown out has the blue strip still but it was faded some what.  yes i have seen the blue strip completely disappear as well.back to the review though.  i would really encourage people to opt for the turbo vs the original or even the vibrating one!  original is cheap  yes, but the turbo feels better on sensitive skin, and the virbrating one i think its a waste of money!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

2152,1061,20080419,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 19, 2008",A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2,Is 5 blades really necessary?,"The Venus Embrace is a nice razor.  It had 5 blades, a surrounding cushion, a grippy handle, and it shaves beautifully.  I can\'t complain.  However, I\'ve been using a Venus for several years -- one with 3 blades -- and *it* shaves beautifully too.  The last time I shaved, I used both razors, one at a time of course, to see which performed better.  I really saw/felt no difference between the two.  The Embrace\'s 5 blades are smaller in width than the other razor\'s 3 blades.  The head of the Embrace is larger, supposedly to offer more cushioning.  But the difference between the two razors\' ability to shave really isn\'t noticable!  They both did a fine job!  So if you have an older-style Venus, you might as well keep using it.  No need to upgrade if you like the razor you already have.  And for those of you who haven\'t tried Venus razors, they allow you to give your legs safe, smooth shave.  I would recommend this product if you don\'t already have a razor you like.Edit: After several months of use, I can warn you... never leave this razor face-down on any surface (countertop, edge of bathtub, etc.)  The material surrounding the blade will stick to that surface and, when you try to pick up the razor, the material will rip like paper and leave a residue on the countertop or wherever (it can be removed, but it\'s sort of annoying.)  Be sure to make use of your razor holder!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this deodorant.  The smell is very nice, rivals Axe in my opinion, it lasts for the better part of the day and using it now in the summer time gives me a good appreciation for its ability to keep off my t-shirts, for the most part.  The only downside is the price, also comparable to Axe products.

5908,2214,20120214,B0039LMT9C,5,"February 14, 2012",ADS5APY1NKTL4,Very pleased with this razor....,"it has been many moons, since the first time I started shaving my legs and underarms. Subsequently, I have tried many different types of depilatories (lotions, potions, waxes, razor blades and the like). God knows, I have the cuts and scars to prove it. If you looked at my legs, you would see a road map of scrapes from past dalliances with razors. Many have come and gone. Frankly, I was often not even looking for quality - I was just looking for a quick, (relatively) fast way to remove unwanted stubble.Low and behold - I happened to read some reviews of Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, complete with 1 Razor and 2 Women\'s Razor Refill Cartridges. The women who used them seemed pleased, so, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring. Sure enough, the simply packaged product arrived at my home, just yesterday. In need of a touch up job, I decided to try my hand at this blade. I must say, I was very pleased. It didn\'t feel like I was even shaving! That was how smooth the razor glided down my legs, and under my arms. The moisture strip definitely did the trick. No ashy, flakey skin or the pain I come to associate with razor burn. The shave was close, too. I don\'t see stubble, after nearly twelve hours - which is unheard of, for me. I am from Lebanese/Latino/Indo European stock. We grow our hair with pride...So, yes, I will try this razor again. Good show.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Closer shave than the Mach 3, and less irritation under the neck.  Here\'s a tip that will save you much money.  I used to get only about 2 weeks works of shaves on the Mach 3.  Years ago, I read an article in Fortune magazine that you can extend the life of a blade by spraying the product \'Clean Shower\' (by Arm and Hammer) after each use.  As a result, I now get 2 months of shaves per blade on both the Mach 3 and now the Fusion.  Really helps since the cost of Fusion blades are so high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5660,1962,20100902,B003983HZK,5,"September 2, 2010",A1VBHX96TQPUXK,Really surprised,"So for about the past 20 years I\'ve been using an electric razor, different brands but lately its been a braun.  When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do have senstive skin, and years back when I shaved, I basically did it incorrectly and from there I got the unpleasant razor bumps. Simply because I wanted to save money by decreasing my trips to the barber shop and I wanted to shave my head (bald) and face, I purchased this Gillette Fusion Manual Razor, as well as other products like Bump Patrol and some traditional Gillette shaving cream. To make a long explanation short, this razor is tremendous, and it gets the job done in every way. When it comes to shaving my head completely bald and shaving my face (and under my chin), it delivers a very close shave and the results speak for themselves. Shaving every night has become a routine procedure now (thanks to advice from a close friend and Bump Patrol) and I\'m fully satisfied with this Gillette Fusion Razor. Highly recommended!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1836,739,20060206,B000BUW8WM,4,"February 6, 2006",A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,Nice Shave But I\'ll Stick With The M3 Power,"I have been using Gillette\'s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it\'s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette\'s other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is how I start off buying a product such as Gillette Clear Shield Deodorant. I identify the leading company and go from there. I stress the unmitigated importance of using the proper deodorant for anyone. You want to go to the job smelling good replete with a fragrance that is not over powering and does last all day.

1927,833,20060509,B000BUW8WM,3,"May 9, 2006",AIBRTGBN07D6A,"more expensive blades, not a more efficienct shave","Even though five blades sounds absurd, I bought this because I thought three and four blades was absurd, but really noticed a difference.  Maybe that\'s where the advances end since I could not tell a difference in shaving between this razor and the Schick Quattro and M3Power razor.  I don\'t feel like it gets a closer shave.  In fact, I don\'t notice any advantages in this razor at all.If you have never used a \'Power\' razor before, try it.  The vibrating that is put off by the batteries is very slight but definitely makes for a closer shave. Battery life is long, and one advantage this razor has is a low battery life indicator. That\'s about it though. The trimmer that was hyped so much is pretty much useless.  I am not a very hairy guy, but I tried it on my sideburns and it didn\'t do anything. Maybe I wasn\'t using it correctly but I couldn\'t tell what it was supposed to do.  As for under the nose, it was worthless there too.The major disadvantage of this razor are the blades.  You\'re going to pay an average of $3 per blade! Considering a blade lasts two weeks at most (which is how often you should replace them, regardless of whether they still work), prepare yourself for a $60 a year razor budget.  The M3Power blades are only $2 a blade, and backwards compatible with previous razors.If money is no object and you don\'t already have an M3Power, this isn\'t a bad razor, but it\'s not nearly worth the hype and price when compared to its predecessor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, she does not like this newer model due to its bulkiness. The lotion in the gel bar is at least as good as her normal shaving cream, but the gel bar makes the head bigger and so it becomes harder to use on curves. We also found the gel bar to be a bit messy if left on counter top, though this razor comes with a shower hook to let us avoid this problem. We can\'t comment on the usable life of the blade, since my girlfriend ditches a blade after its gel bar runs out. I guess she\'s eager to go back to her trusty Venus original...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I shave everyday 7days while at work, while at home for seven days I grow a thickish beard twice prior to shaving.  And like I said I\'ve been doing it since July.  These blades are great!!!!

1857,762,20090820,B000BUW8WM,1,"August 20, 2009",A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,When Greed Meets Engineering Gone Mad!,"For the longest time and for as long as I can remember I have been using Gillette razors.  Recently, I have been forced by them to move to Schick.  Not happy with being a virtual monopoly when it comes to men\'s shavers Gilette decides to over-engineer and to greedily get more profits by going so overboard that they have successfully made me give up on them after decades of being a loyal consumer.  As other reviewers have alluded to I actually got cut a couple of times which has never happened before!  I\'ve come to realise that the battery operated vibrator is a gimmick that does nothing at all to get a closer shave except to cause more batteries to be consumed and to fill up our landfills.  Thankfully, I\'ve been using rechargables for years and hence haven\'t had to buy batteries for years.  For people like me with sharper facial features, this 5-bladed \'wonder\' has such a large amount of rubber that it makes the overall blade area too high/thick (the breadth or height i.e. the vertical edge of the blade) to cover my chin area below my cheeks close enough without cutting my face.  Quite clearly the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns doesn\'t dawn on them when clearly there is a limit to the number of blades before you actually start spoiling the product!  For me it seems any \'improvement\' from going to 5 from 4 blades is so negligible to be non-existent in addition to giving me multiple cuts as the blades now do not contact my face as closely as before when I go from my cheek to my neck area.Unlike Schick where all their blades fit on all their holders greedy Gillette makes us \'upgrade\' to various blades by having to buy ever new blade holders.  Not content with profits from the blades alone, they have to insist on us buying the new holders to increase their revenues.Sick with the blatant exploitation of consumers, I have tried for the first time I can remember the Schick Quattro and I am happy now to get a close shave without cuts for a lower price knowing that any future blade enhancements will still fit my blade holder.Thanks Gillette for pushing me to your competitors; I didn\'t know what I was missing until now.Definitely NOT recommended!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the only razor blade with which I can shave without using any shaving cream (that is why I prefer the one with lubricating strip).  Any other razor blades, made by either Gilette or other companies, including the expensive ones like MACH III, will simply cut me. Then Gillette stopped making them, with no reason whatsoever, probably it worked too well, like the light bulb that will last 100 years.  I complained to their customer service with no avail (they are really not a very customer responsive company)  My friend was smart, he bought a whole bunch from K-Mart when they went out of business.  I used to be able to buy them in local flea markets but lately they all but disappeared.  Therefore, I am simply grateful for Amazon.com to be able to make them available.  It would be nice if they can offer the original razor handle too.  I found the substituted one was just not up to par.

The blades tend to get expensive (and any Fusion blade will fit this unit---don\'t pay a premium for the package to say \'power\') but are well worth it if you have sensitive skin and desire a smooth quick shave.Some will debate the merits of having the \'power\' function.  Generally I only turn it on to get \'stubborn\' hair that tends to be anchored in - I find the vibrations help get them out - other than that I leave it off.Bottom Line __________  Get the cheapest fusion you can.  At the time I wrote this the regular Fusion was .35 cents more than the power.  If nothing else get this one and try the power out, if it isn\'t for you just remove the battery and you still saved yourself a few cents from the regular version.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

Well...for the first time in the history of mankind...there\'s truth in advertising. OK, that\'s a bit of exaggeration on my part, but to be perfectly honest, it actually is the best razor that I have ever used...hands down. I usually only shave once a week (to my family\'s dismay), so my stubble is quite long. I use to have to trim down my semi-beard with an electric razor and then shave, but now I use the ProGlide and it literally \'glides\' through my stubble for a nice clean shave. I also like how the stubble doesn\'t get caught in between the blades. I use to have to bang the razor against the side of the sink to get the captured stubble hairs to come out of the razor, but those days are now long gone.If anyone is reviewing replacement blades (as I am doing here), there should be no question as to the satisfaction of the product (proved by the continuing purchase of the product).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will sell you my blades for 90% off because I will be throwing them out.  Its the worst razor by gillette ever!  It causes razor bumps where no other gillette razor ever did this.

While yes the product does cause less tug and pull, the razor does not give you the same close long lasting shave as the previous generation Mach 5 turbo. This causes you to shave more often and go through blades faster, therefore spending more money.  I have a decent supply now, but I will return to the Turbo\'s when theses are used up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

During that deployment, I managed to use the same blade for 20+ days at a time. Did I mention I also shaved my scalp with the same blade....? Since my return home at the end of 2007, I\'ve been getting a month\'s use per blade on both my face and scalp. I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but, what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long? On the 1st of each month, I replace the old blade with a fresh one. The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months.... You have to admit, that\'s money well spent.I\'ve used all types of blades starting when I was 15...single, double, triple edge blades...Electric shavers, clippers, and even depilatories(which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it, spread it on, wait for it to cure, scrape it off, and wash the excess off my face). I\'ve never had a razor blade that shaved me so close, for so long.To close this review I\'d like to add that I\'ve been on Active Duty in the U.S. Army for 24 years, 7 months & 21 days now and will retire in 41 days (June 30th).

I realise that you have to be skeptical when buying on the internet, but I trusted Amazon to have checked their vendors out.  What is most aggravating is there was no deal in the price.

It claims to have longer lasting qualities, says you should be able to apply the night before and be good to go the following day.  Now, that in itself would be great because I am so disorganized in the morning...It is effective much longer.  The night before, after the shower application is effective for the next entire day.

479,489,20060209,B000BUUVTE,2,"February 9, 2006",A2D6VOCNGBDVF3,"Keeps getting clogged, takes about the same amount of time overall","I usually use a Gillette Sensor with 2 blades (although my latest pack has 3 blades) and I\'m generally happy with it.  I visited my friend couple of days ago and I had to borrow his razor, which was the Fusion.  The problem with this blade (and also the Quattro, and also to some degree the 3 bladed razors) is that because the blades are so close together, the cut hair gets stuck between the blades more easilly.  This requires more time rinsing between strokes, so it overall doesn\'t save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive, so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it\'s important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades (compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel) helps in shaving large parts of skin, like legs or whatever.  But when it\'s your face with its nooks and crannys, I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort. The 6th blade feature was OK, but didn\'t feel like it was worth it.Remember, that with any NEW blade, you will get an awesome shave.  People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it, because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they\'re reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit----Recently got this as a gift.  Same problems as listed before.  I\'ll just use it until I run out of blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have sensitive skin that is dry but also tends to itch a lot once new hair growth starts.  I usually have to use a sensitive skin gel with a razor, even the ones that have strips on them.  I decided to use this in the shower on my legs with the gel I had...worried I shouldn\'t use it alone.  Halfway through I ran out of gel so I had an accidental test with this razor alone on one leg and the combo of gel/razor on the other.  The next day when itchiness tends to rear its ugly head, I didn\'t feel any dryness or irritation from either side.  So the Venus works on my hyper sensitive skin.  I was surprised, after two weeks of hanging in the shower on its included hook, be it as high up and away from water drops and steam I could get it, it didn\'t show any telltale signs of rusting, which I have gotten with other Venus line razors.  It has made me take out razors from the shower and dry them then put them in a bedroom door to give them the longest life. Not this one.  I could use this for a long time, well, until the soap wears off, without the blades getting dull or rusting.  I did, however cut the edge of  my ankle with the razor, it is sharp, caution should be taken with it.  It\'s pretty powerful for what it is though I do have fine blonde leg hair.  That might be why it cuts through it all like butter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

5818,2123,20100527,B003987CL0,4,"May 27, 2010",A3HUC8541SJ6UT,A Woman\'s Review,"As a woman, I realize I am not the target audience for this razor; I use it to shave my legs.  As such, my review will not apply to men who want to know how it glides on the angles of their face, or how it trims the hair near their nose, etc.  Sorry.If you\'re a woman reading this - here\'s what you need to know:First of all, I\'m a teensy bit OCD when it comes to shaving my legs; I shave them every day and sometimes twice a day.  I know - it\'s stupid - I can\'t help it.  Anyway, I thought a power razor would be an easy way to do a quick shave when I\'m doing a 2nd shave of the day... so I wouldn\'t have to get in the shower a 2nd time.  I imagined that the reason for a power razor was that you could use it dry.  No.You still need wet skin to use this razor, and really - wet skin with some sort of lubricant (body wash, etc) is best.  I don\'t really understand why you need a vibrating \'power razor\' when you still have to have wet skin and shaving cream (or similar) to use it.  What is the advantage of the power?  Why not use a regular razor if you\'re doing all that anyway?  There\'s probably some reason that I don\'t get, and I\'m certainly not going to take away stars for my own ignorance, but I\'m just telling you in case you thought you could use this razor dry.As a razor in the shower, it shaves well.  The shave is close and smooth, with no nicks.  Personally I prefer the Schick Intuition since you can skip using the body wash with that (as it has it\'s own lubricating bar).  But this one shaves very well, and an advantage over the Intuition is that it has a \'floating\' head that goes over bumps like knees more easily and smoothly than a stationary blade like the Intuition.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the replacement heads are pretty pricey, and seem to get dull fairly quickly.BOTTOM LINE:  As long as you know what you\'re getting, it\'s a good comfortable razor that\'s easy to hold and shaves well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then we can charge twice as much for replacement blades.Marketing Guy #2: Perfect.  Any consumer would think that 5 blades is far superior to 3.  Let\'s make the thing vibrate too.. that\'ll really blow their minds.Marketing Guy #1: This also buys us some time for when we decide to release the 8 blade razor.  Helloooo promotion!This thing is a gimmick.  It works just as well at any 3-blade razor I\'ve tried.  In fact, packing 5 blades into such a small space requires you to constantly rinse the razor, making for even longer shaving sessions.  Depending on your skin, you will be more susceptible to razor burn with this razor as well.Overall, this thing doesn\'t do anything better than a 3-blade razor.

6343,2654,20110620,B004B8AZH0,4,"June 20, 2011",A329WJEOBESSZ,Great Shave...Just Expensive (But Less So on Amazon),"Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience. They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a good razor but I wanted something better to try. I saw the commericals for the proglide and thought to give it a chance. The proglide is one of the best razors I have ever used. It does not cut and tug on hairs and the blades are so smoooth, despite the old fusion blades being terrible. I love this shave and recommend anyone with sensitive skin to buy this product. The only con I have about this razor is the price of blades. The economy is down and razor blade prices are increasing. WTF?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My old regular razor was a Mach 3 which I have used for a long time.  But my son came of age and I decided to look into new razors.  This seemed to be a good choice based on other reviews.  So, I picked 2 up and the first shave was pretty amazing.  Very comfortable and very close.  It does seem to actually glide.  I think this razor may make me use my electric razor less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This sucker cost me $10 shipped, and although it only includes one cartridge, it lasts me a solid 3-4 weeks, shaving every other day.  I\'ve noticed that the blade only needs 1-2 passes vs. 5+ with other disposable razors like the Gillette Custom Plus.  I\'ve tried the manual version of this razor, and I prefer the power version because it seems to cut even closer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once the gel bars begin to wear out, I remove the gel attachment and use it on its own over my skin. Then I snap the razor back in and shave away. I can easily get 15 uses out of a blade.

I typically have to repeat the shave in each area (twice in each leg, twice in each under arm ect ect) because my other razors just didnt give me a close enough shave the first time around. The five blades in this razor really gave me a tremendous close shave. The first time around with both legs my skin was baby soft and completely hairless it made the whole shaving experience 2x as fast and easier. I used the olay/gillette shaving gel but it was not necessary the blade of this razor is in between two very large olay moisture bars. After my shave my skin felt so extremely soft. I have super sensitive skin and it didn\'t get irritated by this product. Strongly recommend, i would definitely repurchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I love this razor and I have tried others to save money.  But I always come back.  The blades do last, but a fresh razor is always best.  I use the blades as long as possible and change them for dates and important events.  You can get away with about 25 shaves, but for the closest shave, change after a week of use. The best results are usually the first 4 shaves.  I just place the older blades in the case and reuse them for weekend and normal work days. I have gone up to 30 days with one razor.  Try and buy the blades in bulk and on sale.  Amazon had a great sale once, 25% off and free shipping.  That helps reduce the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Gillette has given me the best shaves ever and the fewest nicks.  It is a very popular razor in my gym where I have had two taken from my gym bag. The razor is cheap but the blades are expensive.  This is a trick learned by the computer-printer industry where they sell to you the printer practically at cost but then you keep paying through the cost of the inks.  Gillette pioneeered this technique many years ago.l,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

One criticism she had was that the holder didn\'t stick to the shower wall very well. And since we use that same tub/shower combo to bathe our 3-year old daughter, safety is an issue. My wife thought that the suction on the holder could be a little stronger to keep it above the reach of an active 3-year old who doesn\'t quite know what to do with a razor.But other than that, my wife really enjoys the razor and the shave.

It dries pretty quickly so I didn\'t notice it for long. After removing the lid, the deodorant comes up through these 50 holes in the sub-lid. It\'s wide enough for a huge underarm so a lot was wasted as the product cannot be rolled back down. It does work, I loved the way it didn\'t let me get wet at all.  But, I think I know the reason for that. I don\'t know what the deodorant has in it but after about the third day I had it on, I noticed that at the end of the day my underarms were sticky....hard sticky. That night in the shower I couldn\'t get it off.  The only thing I can akin it to is the feeling that 80\'s fry-baby might have now. The sticky that comes from not removing all of the grease from the outside of the baby.  Just sticky.  I quit using it then.  Even after repeated washings with my hand and a washrag, it took me another two days to get it from under my arm.  I gave it to my husband to use and he hasn\'t complained. Of course, he does have hair and tends to use a liquid deodorant anyway.Another thing that bothered me was that upon looking underneath the sub-lid, the product was almost gone.  I know I didn\'t use that much of it so maybe it got hot in shipping.If you can stand the sticky feeling...but love to be dry...this is the product for you.....and my husband.I wish it had been better for me, I have stock in PG.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2062,969,20080402,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 2, 2008",A3H7ADUP07D93H,Works great but no better than Venus Divine,"When I was growing up razors were a simple affair.  A single blade and that was that.  I remember the first ads when double blades started showing up.  The idea, according to the advertisers, was simple: the first blade would pull the hair so that the second blade could cut it closer to the skin, something that to me defied all logic.  I didn\'t have to worry about it for a long, however, as after a while I switched to depilatories.About a year ago I decided to switch back to shaving and went to buy a razor.  To my dismay, pretty much every model had four blades. What in blazes did anyone need all those blades for?  The heads of these razors were huge.  And why stop at 4?  Why not 6, or 8?  All I wanted was a simple double-bladed razor.  No luck.  I ended up getting the Gillette Venus with three blades and I\'ve been quite happy with it.  Seems someone at Gillette, however, thought that more would be better, or at least more profitable, so when I saw this new red five-headed beast offered through Amazon Vine, I thought I\'d give it a try and see if it was all just marketing hype.  I mean, what the hec? You can always use another razor around the house, right?.  To tell the truth though, I wasn\'t really expecting to like it.  I figured it would be bulky and awkward and just not worth the extra cost of the replacement cartridges.Turns out that this is quite a nice razor in spite of the extra size of the cartridge, which is definitely larger than the three-bladed ones.  First of all, I should point out that all Venus razors accept all Venus cartridges.  I was able to swap cartridges just fine between the new Embrace and my old Venus Divine.  It doesn\'t matter whether you bought a plain Venus, a Venus Divine or a Venus Embrace razor.  You can use any of the replacement cartridges with any of the razors.  The biggest difference between the cartridges is not the number of blades, but the amount of lubrication, as I discovered when I accidentally ordered plain Venus replacement cartridges instead of Venus Divine cartridges.To test out this new razor, I compared it to my old Venus razor with a new plain Venus cartridge, using the new razor on one side of my body and the old one on the other.  Much to my surprise, there was a huge difference in effectiveness as well as comfort between the two, with the Embrace cartridge coming up with much more hair.  Also, the lubrication seemed to smooth over the rough edges of any dull blades.  When you have this many blades, some of them are bound to be dull, but at a cost of about three bucks a pop, you don\'t want to have to throw one out.Okay, this is way too long a review for a stupid razor.  In short, both the Divine and the Embrace are great, better than plain Venus cartridges.  If you already have another Venus razor, though, there\'s no need to buy a new one.  Just get a pack of replacement cartridges.Oh, and by the way -- the blade holder thingy fell off my tile in less than 10 seconds and only holds two replacement cartridges anyway.  Gillette should scrap these things, which are just going to end up in landfills.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My usual go-to-razor is a 3-blade store brand, which works just as good as the old Gillette Sensor. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the close shave from the Fusion Proglide. I still feel the additional blades (over 3) does not contribute to the closer shave. It is a result of the tension strip that stretches your skin as you shave. Although it is a great shave, I don\'t think the additional costs (or blades) justify the extra expense versus a standard 3-blade razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frankly, I didn\'t get how one could get a good shave without shaving gel. However, I\'ve always been impressed with Gillette Venus.  This has all the benefits of the Venus line (the flexibility, the multiple blades) with a wonderfully impressive moisturizing bar that gets shaving done all in one go.It really works!  It makes shaving easy as there is nothing in the way to hide the skin.  The bars make a great yet mild foam and also do the bonus job of keeping the blades a safe distance from the skin--excellent protection.I had a great shave with this with less stress than I have ever had.

135,140,20110304,B00005AUIE,1,"March 4, 2011",A5D4QD4YCZ0LS,Watch out for counterfeits!,"Over 90 days have passed since I placed my order for these, and in this time I have switched between several different razors and only used two of the blades from this box.  At first I thought it was a fluke, but now I know: the blades I purchased from seller bsd sales are counterfeit.  These blades would not stay on either of my Venus razors - the friction from drawing it up my leg was enough to pop it off several times over the course of one shave.  They also did not fit correctly into the plastic they come in; I had to pull the blade out with my fingers instead of pulling it out by the handle like you\'re supposed to be able to do.  Finally, they were so dull that they didn\'t take hardly any hair off of my legs.  I\'ve been using Venus razors for several years now, and I know how sharp they\'re supposed to be out of the box.In conclusion, be careful what you buy.  I know this single one star rating won\'t hurt the popularity of these razors, and it shouldn\'t as they are great razors.  But do be careful who you\'re buying from, because you never know what you\'ll get.(I was unable to give bsd sales a review due to it being more than 90 days since the purchase, but please steer clear of this seller!)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4250,1632,20090429,B001JQLNFA,4,"April 29, 2009",A30Z0GG96D11EO,Love the scent!!,"I am giving the Gillette Venus Breeze, Spa Breeze 4 stars and not a perfect 5 because only time will tell how perfect this razor will turn out to be.Officially I love this new razor!!  The Green Tea scent is very \'spa-like\' and feminine.  The blade contours all the nooks and crannies of my body wonderfully and there wasn\'t one nick at all.  Over the years I have been a loyal follower of the \'Intuition\' razor and \'Veet\' line.  I don\'t like buying shaving cream seperately and find that the cream clogs the razor from doing its job after all.  The downfall of the \'Intuition\' was that the head was rather clunky at about an inch height and the soap part would wear down rather quickly.The Venus has a soft pink head that is actually very gel-like in feeling.  I used it to shave my legs, under arms and bikini area and haven\'t seen any wear on the jelly heads that surround the blades.  The actual handle feels great in my hand; especially the little spot on the head where I place my finger to control the pressure that I apply whilst shaving.  Very thoughtful product that was truly tested.  My one only complaint at the time is that shaved hair gets caught underneath the jelly sides.  I have to manually go and remove all the hair each time.... which is rather annoying.You get two head cartridges with that delightful scent and case that will hold the cartridges and handle.  You can even hang it with the \'stickies\' supplied.  I haven\'t tried the \'stickies\' because from past experience they either fall or they stick to the tile forever while the product is on the floor.  I wish companies would jump on the suction cup back like the \'Intuition\' provides.Highly recommend the product because I did not have one nick or any bumps after shaving.  Very smooth, close shave for a sensitive skin user here!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do not buy!,"I happen to suffer from three things that my wife described until 5 years ago a hughe problem; 1) Extremely sensitive skin, 2) Very (and I men VERY) thick facial folicules, and 3) Keloid cicatrization.I solved my problems through trial and error (which means many cuts and sores!) and different blades and gel trials, I went from shick, wilkison blades, remignton, braun (Electrical) to gillette. And I came to always the same results, cut, burn, soring, irritation, razor burn, you name it I had it, and you can guess, many scars, which made the opperation of shaving worse every morning. The gel to keep it short I went from clinique to gillette and always the same result.  I was using one blade that made shaving more tolerable gillette\'s sensor excell when my wife arrived from one of her shopping errands and presented me with what came to be my salvation for the next four years, the mach3, which I put together with the Neutrogena sensitive skin gel and clinique\'s aftershave balm and the rest is history. Then I reluctantly accepted my wife\'s new present the Mach3 Power, and voila! My perfect match I haven\'t been this happy in years, comfy with minor irritation and no cuts for months! Until last week! When I felt so confident and adventurous about gillette\'s new product, I spotted it cueing in the supermarket and thougt \'It\'s gillette! More blades, better shave, what can go wrong?\' Well, when I arrived home my wife told me, that machine looks mean, and I replied, yes and I hope its mean with my beard and gentle with my skin, we shared a laugh. Next morning I went to the bathroom and started sahving, one pass, second pass, not bad... third pass... slash, hughe, and I mean big, cut just on the border of my mandible! I was pulling down when this happened! I was being extra careful due to the sharpness of new blades. It peeled off about 3/8\' by almost 2\' of my skin, I have only seen this kind of surgical precision on dermatomes! It took me eons to stop the bleeding. You can imagine my dismay, I got my refund and be done with it for good!Why can\'t Gillette just have a mach3 power with the nice features of battey indicator and the chip set as well as a more powerfull motor? That would work perfectly for anybody, hell... I would buy it, eventhough their product slashed my chin open!P.S. My wife told me \'I told you it looked mean\' I did not laugh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &quot;indicator strip&quot; sooner.I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Gillette multiblade systems are very forgiving of rushed shaving, and truly do a pretty good job.  That said, I\'d need to be able to shave in a tenth of a second to justify $3.50 or more per cartridge.  Seriously, Gillette?For times when you have a little more time to shave, I\'d recommend a good old-fashioned safety razor.  With a little more time for shaving, and a little attention to technique, you can get shaves with an old safety razor that are as good or better than anything you can do with a Gillette Fusion.Besides having razor blades that cost a tenth as much as the Fusion cartridges, a classic styled Merkur safety razor is a solid, well-made tool.  Much more satisfying to use than anything made of plastic.  And a puck of good quality shaving soap might cost $10 or less, and it will last you an entire year.  To top it all off, safety razors are more environmentally sound than the plasticky Gillettes.  No pressurized metal cans of goo, and the double-edged blades are inexpensive to manufacture and to purchase.More tips:  Proraso shave cream in the green metal tube is the best.  Gillette 7 o\'clock sharp edge double edge blades (made in Russia) are great and inexpensive - $34 for  100 at the time of this review.

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.

232,241,20061222,B0001LQGEM,4,"December 22, 2006",A38QEATH3NODFM,"fits old sensor razors, but I prefer the 2 blades myself.","I have had the original Sensor for almost 12 years now, and it still works the best of the ones i have tried. The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads. Its great to see Gillette has done what store brands have done long ago, add the 3 blade and it does work better than the others, but the two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving. Don\'t waste money on more expensive newer models, if you have this one or can get this one, blades are cheaper and it does better, Gillette sensor blades last longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5801,2104,20100606,B003987CL0,5,"June 6, 2010",A14KNSRIZ8OTSG,Better than Fusion Power,"I have used the Fusion Power since it came to market.  I liked the old version, but the lubricating strip wore away after only 4 shaves and I experienced discomfort frequently while shaving.  I was a bit skeptical when this new Fusion ProGlide came out.  I mean, how much better could it be?  From the first stroke of the blade, I could feel the difference.  NO PAIN!  It was smooth, comfortable, and left a swath of stubble-free skin that didn\'t need an additional shaving.  I finished shaving and was VERY pleased, so much so that I look forward to my next shave which never happened with the old model.  Thanks for the improvements!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4215,1596,20090622,B001JQLNFA,5,"June 22, 2009",A28OB1QLXN5BM6,"Silky, Smooth, And Easy To Use","I really like the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE RAZOR.  I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \'made for a woman, not a man.\'  This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.Like the standard (purple) VENUS BREEZE, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR (pale pink) comes with a holder which mounts directly to the wall of your shower or bath.  Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  The three blades are surrounded by gel bars.  There is no need to use shaving cream; just moisten the gel bars to get that silky, satiny feel.  The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme climate.To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  This will help any razor to give you a closer shaver.  While you are soaking, get the cartridge wet, so that the gel gets creamy.  You never want to shave with a dry razor anyway...ouch!  I usually just toss the razor in the tub for a minute or two.  Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  Just one less thing to worry about.The only negative about the VENUS BREEZE is that the gel bars do not last as long as the blades!  With care, the blades in each cartridge last up to a month.  (The triple blades shave my legs so close, that I really only need to shave them every other day.)  But the gel bars either run out or fall off in 2 - 3 weeks.  Then I go back to the shaving cream until the blades give out.Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  I have been satisfied with it for many years.  If Gillette could just make the gel bars last a bit longer...the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4198,1579,20120308,B001JQLNFA,5,"March 8, 2012",AQXDCHJISSV7J,I will never use another razor!,"I absolutely LOVE this razor. I always hated using shaving cream, because of the mess. Also, I love to shave in the shower, which is difficult with shaving cream. With this razor, I shave in the shower, no problem. I always find that I rarely cut myself (i didn\'t cut myself a lot before, but i don\'t get those little cuts at my ankles and knees). I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2427,1343,20080809,B001F51QJ8,5,"August 9, 2008",A2KP4CWYUTKUFO,A great product!,"This is a fantastic product that does what it promises to do!  I am the kind of person that finds a product that works and uses it for a long time.  I have been using Mitchum deodorant for over 10 years.  Because of my allergies to perfumes and fragrance, I could not use the other Gillette Clinical Strength products. However, when I found this one, it passed the sniff test.  Although it has a scent, it is best described as a \'masking scent.\' This means that while the product is on me, I do not smell it. I can smell it when I put it on, but it does not make me sneeze.  That means, throughout the entire day, I have the protections of the product without the fragrance.The deodorant instructions state to put it on at night, since that is when it works best.  I follow those instructions, but I also put on a small amount after my showers.  It is hot in Southern California, and I have to walk a far distance to teach my classes on campus. I sweat, and what professor wants to stink in front of their class?  Compared to the Mitchum (and a few others I experimented with) this product is the best deodorant I have ever used.  I do not smell myself in front of the class room while teaching.  I have worked outside all day, sweating in hot weather, and when I come inside the house, my underarms smell like I just put the deodorant on.I highly recommend this product.  I have allergies, so I am limited to certain kinds of hygiene products.  Although not completely scent free, this deodorant has done a great job controlling odor and wetness without bothering my nose.  I am more comfortable now because I do not have to worry about smelling bad when talking to someone!Give it a try, and I hope it works for you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1892,798,20070425,B000BUW8WM,4,"April 25, 2007",A1YFX3KREPTCZ8,Better than I expected,"Before trying this razor, I was using the Mach III (which was a good razor as well, although I never used the Mach III Power); and despite my best efforts not to get sucked into advertising, I decided to try the Fusion Power after seeing the commercials. But now I\'m glad I switched.I only shave every other day, and rarely on weekends, so sometimes I\'ll go 3 or 4 days without shaving. And the Fusion does a great job with the extra growth. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the \'comfort guard\' helps make it a smooth cut. And the power part is a big help; once I\'m done, it\'s a closer shave than the Mach III was. I also have a goatee, and the main blade of the Fusion can actually trim the edges.There are only 2 minor negatives to the Fusion: Cleaning out the comfort guard is a bit of a hassle, and the blue guard makes it hard to see any hair (mine is dark brown) that\'s been caught in it; and the battery indicator is basically useless. It\'s been \'low\' for several weeks, and a brand new battery didn\'t make a difference. So I guess when the razor stops working I\'ll know the battery is dead.Overall, a good step up from a simple razor.Update (11/17/07): It seems I misunderstood the battery indicator, which I apparently didn\'t look at very closely when I bought the razor. I thought the battery symbol on the razor would indicate when the battery was low, and that\'s why I thought it was \'low\' for so long; I didn\'t realize that it was like that all the time! The entire area around the battery symbol and the power button will actually flash orange when the battery is low, as I discovered this week. So I apologize to anyone that might have read my review and was misinformed because of it. And now the only minor negative about the razor is still the issue of cleaning the comfort guard.On the positive side, however, it seems the Fusion will last quite a while on one battery: Mine was still going strong in April when I originally posted this review -- and I had had the razor for some time then -- and despite the fact that I don\'t shave every day, the original battery (which I put back in after a new one didn\'t matter) lasted until now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I do think that they proglide may be sharper and give a better shave for the first 1-3 shaves but then they seem the same.  I also think the proglide did not last quite as long but can\'t be sure.  I usually got 2 weeks from the regular but only got about 10 days with the proglide.  Reason I can\'t be sure is I skipped shaving and it had to deal with a 2 day growth twice and that may have \'shortened\' the use.  I just wish I could find a razor that was more economical.  I had gone electric but suffered from irritation and when you figure the purchase plus the 2x a year blade replacement (yes electrics need blade replacement too) the cost came out the same.  When the 5 blade razor first appeared a news story did a comparision with the 3 blade.  There was no noticeable difference in the quality of shave that the review panel could feel.  I may go back to the Mach 3 or try a Schick product.  I have always used Gillette razors.  I would give a 4 for quality but knock it down to a 3 because of cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(They come in an orange package, not the blue package as the newer blades come.)Keep the blades in a dry place and they will last longer.I also bought the blades via Amazon\'s subscribe and save, 12 count and now my husband and I are never far away from a close shave.

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

I have a heavy beard and sensitive skin, so I am always on the lookout for a better shaver. I have tried several electrics [Norelco & Braun] and of course they are no match for a blade. I have tried the Schick multi blade shavers and the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power with the vibrating handle is better. The blades really do seem to glide over my skin, and if I re-shave against the grain, I get the closest shave I have ever had. This is an improvement over the older Gillette Fusion.  I also recommend using the Gillete Fusion Thermal Face Scrub just prior to shaving. It heats up the skin and seems to thicken and raise the beard hairs so the shave is even closer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

The Schick Quattro my wife gave me (after getting a coupon for a free one) found itself at the city landfill after 7 days.  I have a full, thick beard and fairly sensitive skin.  This blade cleans my face perfectly and I find it extremely rare to suffer a nick or cut on my face.  The handle is perfectly designed and bends to the contour of my face.  The blades pop in and out easily.  One drawback is that the blades are just a bit pricy.  But, the blades also last as long as three of the disposable blades I used to use.  The moisturizing strip could last a little longer, but it isn\'t a major factor for me.I gave this product a 5 because it is the best razor I have found.  I will keep trying to use new razors to see if someone can beat it, but, until then, I am staying with the Mach 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

6486,2801,20120314,B0062IWQVU,4,"March 14, 2012",A2FS81TQQXWZYB,"The perfect shaver and trimmer, but only good for the face...","I bought the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler after seeing it was supposed to be a great tool for facial hair detailing and lining.  And after owning it for a month or two now, it\'s definately a good trimmer to be battery powered, but not great as it is advertised.  First I\'ll list the pros...ProsGreat for shaving-With the fusion proglide heads, this razor is awesome.  It has the same quality, but better since it has the higher quality handle.  I threw away my old proglide handle in favor of this sleeker and more efficent design.  As far as the face shaving aspect of this product, it\'s excellent.Great for trimming your facial hair-Another aspect where the Styler is excellent.  I\'ve used it to trim my goatee and sideburns quite a few times, and it gives an even and effective trim.  Plus, it\'s the original reason I bought the Styler, since my Phillips Norelco beard trimmer cut and trimmed my facial hair unevenly.  With this though, trimming is very fast and simple.  I also like how the trimmer comes with three length combs, making it easy when I decide to grow a beard and blend my goatee with interchangable trimmer combs.  When trimming my goatee, I used the 3 guide comb, which is perfect for trimming the length on shaggy hair without completely oblitterating my goatee.  Then, when I wanna grow my beard out, I used the 1 guide comb to blend my goatee in with my stubble.The razor comes complete with a stand to hold everything-I couldn\'t believe for $20, I got a razor/trimmer/attachment combs/tray.  The tray that comes inside the packaging means your bathroom will be more organized than using traditional razors or trimmers.  It\'s also smart the way the tray has 3 openings in the back for each guide comb and one opening in the top for the fusion head attachment to rest in.  And the fusion attachment head is built efficently, since it has an attachment that fits neatly on top of the trimmer head.  It also looks cooler and makes storage easy and effective.Now onto the cons...ConsNot great for lining facial hair-While this trimmer is perfect for trimming facial hair and shaving, it\'s not great at lining a beard, sideburns or goatee.  This actually surprized me, since the Gillette campaign in the advertisements claims it\'s great for lining and detailing.  Specifically showing in the commercials how supposedly great it is in detailing and lining facial hair.  In that department, it\'s a bit of a disappointment, but I\'ve never found any cartridge razor that can line as well as a disposable razor, and this is no exception.  And as far as the edger is concerned, the few times I\'ve tried lining with it, it never did a phenominal job, more like mediocre at best, since in most instances I wound up using a disposable razor to correct it.Doesn\'t have a long battery life-Not really too surprizing here, since I\'m kind of OCD when it comes to keeping my facial hair looking neat.  Plus, I have used it more often than just on my face, thus a partial reason why the battery isn\'t lasting very long.  I\'d say the average battery life of the Styler would be a month if not used for body hair or any other non facial detailing purpose.  Since it\'s so efficent though, this isn\'t a major issue for me.  Others might see it that way however, since batteries are kind of costly to replace.Not great for use on body hair or lining the back of your neck-I really don\'t consider these two areas major issues, since the Styler is only intended for face use anyway.  I feel though that I must point out for those who think this might be great for trimming body hair or good for lining your neck in between barber visits, this isn\'t the tool for either purpose.  With this being a battery controlled trimmer, it\'d take you forever to use on body hair.  Plus, to me using something on your body hair that\'s intended for your face is kind of cross contaminating anyway.  I initially thought I might be able to use this for lining my neck hair in between trims, but this won\'t leave an even cut or line.  Something my old beard trimmer could do, but again not a big deal to me, since this product is for facial shaving and maintenance.Overall, I rate this 4 out of 5 stars since it\'s great at shaving and trimming facial hair.  Really, for about $20 bucks, this Styler is a quality invcstment for any guy.  It can do most things a beard trimmer can at half the cost(not counting the cheapo pieces of crap trimmers).  I wish this thing was rechargable, then it would be darn near perfect.  If you\'re expecting to be using this for any other purpose than facial hair, you might want to invest in a good body hair trimmer or hair clipper set instead.  Otherwise though, I have been happy with this purchase and would buy another set once it needed replacing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel that I get a good shave with them and I like the \'menthol burn\' that I get after shaving and feeling the shaving gel with that slight burn.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

      </div>

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

4242,1624,20090508,B001JQLNFA,4,"May 8, 2009",AWIF8AR75LL9L,Nice razor not sure about the holder,"I am enjoying the Gillette Venus Spa Breeze razor so far.  It is similar to the Embrace Venus razor, but the Embrace has rubberized strips that make the blades float above the skin.  The Venus Spa Breeze Razor has two strips of very hard milled soap on the top and bottom so that you do not have to use soap or shaving cream/lotion when you shave.The soap is not overly scented.  It is not overly lathery either, which surprised me.  It is quite solid and does not melt easily, which is good because you won\'t blow through the soap before you finish the razor in sharpness.The soap does have sodium lauryl sulfate (and some relatives) in it which I avoid in my skin care products, but it is not a large amount and it did not leave my skin parched when I got done using it.The storage rack that comes with the Spa Breeze Razor is nice but I don\'t like the way it attaches to the wall.  It has two square adhesive strips that you are supposed to attach to a clean shower wall and then hang the case up on it with little knobs that hook it in.  I don\'t like that idea- there is too much risk of sticky being left behind being yet another challenge in cleaning the walls of the shower once it has lived through its usefulness and has to be removed.I have given this four stars because of the case mounting idea, and the fact that I don\'t like this razor quite as much as the EMBRACE by Venus.  The EMBRACE seems to shave closer and more easily than the Spa Breeze Razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1909,815,20061004,B000BUW8WM,3,"October 4, 2006",A4BA2SSCQ2W56,an objective review.,"well well well, i\'ve been on a long search to find the perfect razor and read tons of reviews on every razor out there.  first off, a lot of people are judging this razor very unfairly because they\'re mad about the price of blades.  well, that\'s life.  there\'s a site on the net where you can buy cryogenically frozen blades at about the same price that supposedly last 4 times as long.  they\'re a great business.amazon overall gives the fusion mixed reviews, and i\'ve found the fusion to be a mixed bag.  first, the design.  i loved the mach 3 design and the gillette fusion continues that.  it\'s definitely a better way to shave than with the old designs.  also, the handle on the fusion is insanely comfortable.  it\'s SO comfortable, it\'s almost as if the handle has a life of its own!  it\'s crazy.  way better than any other razor handle ever.  the design is mostly like the mach 3 except with 2 blades.  contrary to what you have heard, the head is NOT much bigger than the mach 3.  in fact, the blades start from the top at the SAME point.  i didn\'t have trouble shaving under my nose or anywhere else.  the total blade area is slightly larger than the mach 3 which is a GOOD thing.  this + 5 blades = a faster shave.  add the battery \'power\' feature to this, and you\'re basically shaving with lightning!  you HAVE to try the power feature.  it\'s amazing.. it eliminates tugging.  it slices right through facial hair.  absolutely brilliant.  it\'s no gimmick, believe me.  also, the blades do NOT get more clogged, another lie.  in fact, these blades get LESS clogged than any razor i\'ve ever used.  one other thing - the single-blade trimmer on the back is far from \'useless.\'  it\'s incredibly useful and does exactly what you need.  it\'s innovative and an improvement over the mach 3.  so with all this brilliance, what could go wrong, you ask?razor burn.  the same problem i had with the mach 3!!  i would lift my cheek up and see little razor burn all along it, and get razor burn on one part of my neck.  that wasn\'t too bad, until around the 6th or 7th shave, when it suddenly tore up my neck with razor burn!!  now, you may say i used the blade too long.  however, there\'s no good way to tell when the razor is going to cause you problems.  the lubrication strip wears out too fast, on like the third shave but the blades are still sharp.  so i kept using it, still getting close fast shaves and one day it cut me up.the shave itself - the fusion definitely does give a closer shave than the mach 3, particularly if you use the power feature and a great shaving gel (in my case, king of shaves magna gel ARB formula).  however, it seems to get \'too\' close in a way.  my face would itch.  i\'d look in the mirror and see a kind of film over my skin, apparently skin that had been shaved off.  not cool!!  i would use the fusion if my skin could handle it..  maybe i will try using it without the power feature and see if that helps.  the power is so fast & fun to use that it\'s addictive.  but i\'m afraid i may be doomed to using razors older than the mach 3...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs. I love it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve been using Mach-3 blades for a some time with mediocre results -- maybe because I haven\'t been shaving every day -- so I wanted to switch to something better and cheaper.  Atra blades are much less expensive than most other blades (e.g., Fusion), but it just doesn\'t work for me... and I think I may know why: my shaving technique sucks.The angle of the blade when shaving is very important.  The pivot point of the Atra is in the middle of the blade, which acts like a seesaw fulcrum: if you have the right pressure but a slightly wrong angle, the Atra will pivot to a more correct angle and shave well; if you have the wrong pressure but a good angle, it may result in irritation; and if both your pressure and angle are bad (like me), then it may result in irritation with nicks and cuts (and razor burn).Unlike the Atra, the pivot point of the Mach-3 is at the bottom of the blade: if the angle is wrong, then the Mach-3 will pivot to a better angle; if the pressure is a little too strong, the Mach-3\'s pivot will also correct for that; and if both the pressure and the angle are bad, then the Mach-3 may result in a good shave regardless of how much your shaving technique sucks.More blades may mean more irritation for people with sensitive skin, so Mach-3 is the highest I want to go.  If there is a (cheaper) two-blade razor with a bottom pivot, then I will try it.  I noticed similar irritation when I used the Sensor two-blade razor, and I think that the reason was due to the pivot point and my poor technique.  I really wanted to keep using the Atra because the price is much better, but it just didn\'t work for me.  If I ever learn good technique then I will start using a double-edge safety razor, but until then... it\'s Mach-3 for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were about two shaves worth of this in the sample I received. I used one and immediately threw the rest in the trash.It was like trying to shave with Crisco. It was very oily and hard to wash off my hands. It did the worst job of softening my beard of ANY shaving cream or gel I\'ve ever used, then after the shave, was equally difficult to completely wash the residue off my face.The (brand new) razor blade was left with this stuff gunked up between the blades as if I had run it through a can of solid Crisco shortening. I don\'t know how much hot water (VERY hot) I had to use before it finally all washed out of the blades, but it was far too much.The shave itself was similar to when I\'ve been caught on a trip without shaving cream and used bath soap to lather with, in that it makes it possible, but not comfortable. I\'d rather use bath soap to shave with than this stuff, and I\'m not exaggerating in making that statement.I have used Edge shaving gel for years. In contrast to this product, Edge does not leave an oily residue on my hands, does soften my beard (and my beard is a bit on the tough side), does not need intense scrubbing to remove from my face, and does not imbed itself into the razor blades. With Edge and a new blade, I never have any \'pull\' on a shave. My first, last, and only shave with this mess was an irritating pull on every shaving stroke (yes, with a brand new first time ever used blade).I\'m a big fan of the Fusion razors, but whoever invented this junk, and anyone else in the company that green-lighted it for sale, should be horse whipped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

282,291,20091116,B0001LQGG0,4,"November 16, 2009",AAYJA4GME03V6,"Truly Divine? Well, Close Enough","I\'ve been using Venus Divine blades for years. I love that they fit on any Venus razor; although, they best match the Divine handle because of the blue text on the blade. They\'re rounded so there\'s no sharp edges. However, they can sometimes be bulky when it comes to feminine curves. Because there are no wires over the blades, the Venus Divine razor is quite easy to rinse off. It doesn\'t have as many nooks and crannies which attract hair, soap or cream like the Quattro blades.Overall, I love the Divine razors. I always get a great shave on my legs and underarms. Those areas don\'t require any shaving cream with Divine\'s multiple moisture strips. I rarely cut myself and irritation around the bikini line and intimate areas is minimal when used with a good shaving cream. The comfort coated blades glide quite smoothly over the skin without catching or scraping, with help from the smoothing cushions. I believe both of those features are only on the Divine razor blades, not the regular Venus blades.The moisture strips add moisture you can touch to the blades (much more-so than the original Venus blades); although, it can feel a bit slimy if you leave it in the shower (the slimyness and moisture both fade over time). The moisture strips are supposed to fade when it\'s time to refill but I\'ve honestly never noticed it so I just replace when I feel like I am not getting an awesome shave anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4416,1804,20120129,B003983HRI,3,"January 29, 2012",AMUP8DYE7EAN2,Maybe I\'ll sharpen the venetian blind slats,"Because for my purposes this razor isn\'t that much better than a pack of dollar store double edge disposables to  justify paying the cost for replacement cartridges.I\'ve been shaving my head for the last fifteen years and my face for considerably longer. I switched to a safety razor for facial shaving more years ago than I care to remember and I have yet to find a disposable or replaceable or for that matter rechargeable (and I have tried quite a few) that comes anywhere close to equaling the resultant closeness of cut or smoothness particularly when those infuriating independent gray hairs that crop up under the chin are considered. However, I am not as adept in avoiding a sling blade result on the back of my head with a safety razor so I am constantly in the market to identify a disposable or replaceable that fills the bill.To that end, the ProGlide is acceptable but I still had to make several passes on the back of my head to get a smooth, minimally stubby result, not unlike the outcomes with a Mach 3 or Schick 3... or one of the five rechargeables currently residing in one bathroom or another. Interesting enough, I also got better results on my head with the back side trimmer single blade than the front side five blade shredder.  I didn\'t feel any discomfort like pulling or tugging or experience any inadvertent nicks. Actually, I was mildly surprised that it had cut as close as it did since it felt like it was not cutting at all which I suppose is somewhat of an endorsement.However, with the ongoing cost of replacement cartridges, for my needs there are far too many less expensive, equally beneficial alternatives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6289,2599,20060323,B004B8AZH0,5,"March 23, 2006",ADQG79SS5N72A,Doesn\'t Provoke Folliculitis!,"If you suffer from folliculitis, this may just be the razor you were waiting for! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Also, before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

407,417,20090603,B000277P5E,3,"June 3, 2009",A1CZ1LZWH34YFH,No near as good as I expected,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000277P5E/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI purchased three boxes of the Mach 3 Turbo blades when Amazon was having a sale on them.  I checked to make sure they worked with the regular Mach 3 razer, which I have (they do), and was thrilled to only be paying that price rather than regular store price of even the Mach 3 blades.Until I got them that is.  Right before they arrived, I NEEDED new blades, so I bought a pack at the store.  That pack was horrible...I felt like I didn\'t shave my legs at all.  I couldn\'t even really feel it against my skin as I was shaving like you normally do.  I literally had to go over each swipe like 3 times...and still wasn\'t a good smooth feel.When I got the blades from Amazon, the first pack I opened were the same thing.  I was ready to scream considering what you pay for the razors and the blades...a disposable would get you the same result.  I tried a blade from the second pack then, and that one worked MUCH better.I really think Mach is going downhill in their products, and it has become a \'you might get lucky and it works well\' with the razor blades.  Some are fine...some are horrible.if it is worth it to you to take a chance, then...you might get lucky.  As for me...I think I am looking for a new razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought a set in December 2009 as extras, and they arrived without any issues.  I just finally opened them up, the packaging, internal case, and the blades themselves all looked 100% legit to me.  When I began shaving however, I KNEW something was majorly wrong.I kept shaving because at the time it did not cross my mind that there could even be fake Mach 3 blades.  I was trying to figure out if my face wasn\'t warm enough, I even had to check to make sure that I had put enough shaving cream on.  I was just baffled as to why the razors were more pulling out my hair and cutting my skin than they were actually shaving the hair.Needless to shave I ended up with a horrible shave job with hair still remaining in small patches, an extremely irritated and cut face, and a realization that I was completely scammed.  Since the packaging looked legit, I had no reason to doubt the product and I\'m not outside of the window to do too much about it.I am worried now that the blades were not even sterile, and I have never in my life had my face burn so bad after a shave.

4196,1577,20100115,B001JQLNCS,5,"January 15, 2010",A37UE70DJQJ4EN,yes yes yes,This product is a disposable razor so it won\'t last forever. That is the downside. On the upside this razor is fantastic. It makes shaving the legs so simple. I highly recommend its use during pregnancy when legs might be difficult to see and reach. It does not require shaving cream and makes one less step in the shaving process. I have fairly sensitive skin and I did not get any razor burn at all. The shave is also closer than the cheap disposable razors I was using before finding this. The shave bar dissolves pretty quickly I have found that if I keep it out of the shower it lasts longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After signing up for the subscription and purchasing my first order of the razors, I received an email shortly prior to the second month, which I was notified of a price increase. The increase? 38% higher than the original price. So what\'s the deal?? Does Amazon hook people in for automatic purchases for items similar to this that use the Gillette business model? Get them hooked then increase the cost, in hopes that the consumer doesn\'t notice or is too lazy to cancel?? I\'m extremely disappointed and fairly annoyed. This is a bad business practice. If you\'re going to offer a subscription on a product at a set price, then try honoring that price, not an immediate increase of 38% once you have the consumer signed up. Bad...bad business Amazon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2027,934,20111205,B000XVSNTQ,5,"December 5, 2011",A3EADWE0F3A1J6,Amazing!,"First I have to commend Venus on there packaging. We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs.

The Embrace is the first time I feel like they\'ve improved on the original design.  The Breeze has a similar moisture ribbon, but it always melts off before the blades are worn out, and the heads are just too expensive for that to be tolerable.The moisture ribbon on the Embrace is pretty solid to the touch so you really don\'t get any more than you need and it doesn\'t melt prematurely.  There\'s no residue on my legs when I\'m done shaving, just smooth skin.  The best part is I can have both legs shaved from ankle to hip in one third of the time it used to take me to shave with other razors because I don\'t need to use shave gel, and the handle and the shape of the head make it really hard to cut myself, so I can just go zip-zop.The only issue I\'ve had is that it\'s slightly tricky to shave armpits with the Embrace because the head is so big, and it\'s a bit difficult to maneuver in intimate areas.  It\'s no less effective than other razors, it just takes some adaptation and adds a little time.  That said, all in all, my total shave time -- legs, armpits, intimate region -- is half of what it used to be, and that\'s more than worth the price of the Embrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

2174,1083,20080415,B000XVSNTQ,3,"April 15, 2008",A2HXE29CU1I24Y,A few good improvements...until next year\'s replacement.,"Gillette has once again upped the ante by switching from a 3-blade shaving system and jumped to 5 blades since the competitor has brought to market their \'quattro\' version.I\'m surprised that after producing a powered razor in the form of Gillette Venus Vibrance, they have opted to go back to basics in a non-powered model that we now see as the Gillette Venus Embrace.  And despite being non-battery operated the price of both products has remained the same.PROS:1. The rubber grip on this new model is top of the line.  There is a \'gel\' quality feel to it that creates a soft cushion to the fingers, but still maintaining a nice solid grip.2. The shaving head is a size XL!  This means even more moisture content to help protect and smoothen the skin while shaving.3. The in-shower storage has been redesigned from the all=time rectangular shape of previoius Gillette razors and formed into a pod shape which Gillette now calls a \'ShowerPod\'.  The modern design is visually appealing and should enhance the bathrooms.Another good thing is that there are two suction cups behind the pods to create an easy install process.  This is a great move away from the old stick tape which can be placed once only with no chance for relocation should you decide you stuck it to a bad portion.  With the ShowerPods, you don\'t need to overthink your location which gives freedom to shift or hide the razor as you please.4. FIVE (5) Blades.  This is a matter of debate.  I welcome more blades to help reduce having to go over the same area and refrain from skin irritation.  More blades also means the hair has more chances of being cut even deeper has the blades pass over the area.  But I am quite disappointed as well with the quality of the blades (which brings me to the cons...)CONS:1. FIVE (5) THIN blades.  Compare the quality of the blades from the old Gilette Venus razors to this new 5-blade system and you will see what they have become.  It seems Gillette has every intention to help consumers keep on replacing the blades more often than before.  The blades are so thin that they loose sharpness faster than ever making you wonder and evaluate how much you should really be spending on this aspect of personal grooming.Of course I welcome more blades in a shaving system to create a smoother shave.  To achieve such characteristic is to have the blades spaced very closely together.  By choosing to do this, you risk loosing other customers that have a thicker hair folicle since a smaller gap means the hair doesn\'t pass thru between the blades and ends up getting stuck.  In the process, the shaving system fails to work as intended and resulting to nicks and cuts.The solution is to frequently run the blades and shake it in a container of water (or running water if you don\'t have the heart to save water at this day and age) in order to loosen and remove any shaved hair that may have piled up in the shaving head.2. EXPENSIVE.  Sure buying a new shaving system is relatively cheap.  But if you still haven\'t learned from the PRINTER/INK CARTRIDGE market, you should watch out for the price of replacement heads especially for newly introduced technology like this.3. MARKET LIFE.  As with Gillette products and marketing, they always have something up their sleeve.  So I wouldn\'t be surprised if they have a powered version ready for market release or a simple change of color depending on the theme of the times.  So you invest in a pack of replacement heads from your local wholesale warehouse and  before you know it, you are marketted another revolutionary shaving idea.4. COLOR/DESIGN.  The color is really wonderful and in time for Spring, but displaying it with your white ShowerPod may not fit all bathrooms.  Yes, it\'s a shaver but it still is built to be displayed within easy reach at the shower for convenience.  But give us a more neutral color like WHITE!  In fact make an ALL WHITE SHAVER and call it the GILLETTE VENUS ANGEL.  Together with the ShowerPod, that should be a better option for most bathroooms.CONCLUSION:Yes, the Venus Embrace is great.  You have created a five blade system and beat the competition once again.  The gel handle is the highlight of this release together with a very big shave head to help create an even smoother experience.However...What I would really like consumers to experience is a better shaving system with a head that lasts longer.  With all the manufacturing techniques, why not create blades that are not only sharper, but also maintains the sharpness.  This should be more convenient than having to stack up tons of replacement blades in the bathroom.  Make use of stronger and lighter materials like Schick\'s use of TITANIUM.  How about go seal the deal in technology and create a PORCELAIN-coated BLADE.  Anything as long as you can give us an idea that you also care for us to save.  In turn, we will create the illusion that we will also be loyal to the brand until the day we die.I still have a problem with the close spacing of the blades creating clogged hair in between them.  The idea of more blades will create cutting shaving time may not hold true since you will have to do more steps in loosening the hair particles in water.Overall, this is another winner in shaving experience.  But it\'s what we would expect from a manufacturer who wants to introduce better technology and ensure a steady replacement of expensive shave heads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5790,2092,20100611,B003987CL0,5,"June 11, 2010",A2V4BTE2YW4TXL,Major Improvement over Fusion,"Normally I wouldn\'t take the time to write a review of a razor, but in this case I couldn\'t help myself. I was hesitant to buy the proglide since I knew it was just an \'improved\' version of the fusion. I figured this was just an attempt to sell us something all us fusion owners already had and my suspicion was furthered by other reviews posted here, which said the proglide was not much of an improvement over the fusion. But I decided to try it as I love new toys and though I really like the fusion I don\'t think it is perfect as occasionally it does give me razor burn. So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion. I don\'t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced. Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn\'t think it was perfect. But the proglide is so good I\'m not sure what the next step in shaving evolution will be as I feel this is as good as it gets. Definitely worth the $11 or so to switch from the fusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4206,1587,20100328,B001JQLNFA,1,"March 28, 2010",A3O3BQCBCA1VCT,"Slime and burn, slime and burn","Okay, so I received a free sample of this razor (it came in a clear travel bag, with a free bottle of shower gel and a free bar of deodorant. I needed the travel bag, and it was only (...) for the bag and all the free stuff, so it was a no-brainer).What I like about this razor:1. It\'s pink.2. It\'s thin, girly and cute.3. It\'s comfortable to hold.4. It has the built-in shaving gel.Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 of those are all really superficial and don\'t amount to much.What I don\'t like about this razor:1. The very first thing I noticed about it is that there is a slimy, goopy gook that stretches (picture okra or chicken slime when you\'re cleaning it) as you shave. It is absolutely, positively gross and unsightly. Perhaps I\'m making too big a deal of that, but I have a weak stomach, and that really grossed me out.2. I wet my legs, turned the shower off, and sat down inside.  After I shaved my right leg, I immediately began shaving my left leg (I had some Nair on my bikini area, so I didn\'t have time to waste). While I was shaving my left leg, my right leg began to sting. After about two minutes, it became unbearable, so even though the time wasn\'t up on my Nair and I hadn\'t quite finished my left leg, I had to get under some running water.  THAT MADE IT WORSE!!! Both my legs began to burn! Discomfort is an understatement. I was in pain! I don\'t normally have sensitive skin, and this was the first time I\'ve ever had a shaving product to make me feel that way. It was absolutely unbearable.So bad that I actually had to write a review. I think in my entire life, I may have been compelled to write a review once or twice. That\'s how bad this experience was. So it\'s been about 15 minutes since I got out the shower. My legs aren\'t burning anymore, and they feel somewhat smooth. Not as smooth as my regular razor (Schick Intuition - which is nice and gives great results, but so bulky and big), but it\'ll do. I don\'t think the blades on this Spa Breeze got as close as I would like.All in all, I would never buy this razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5811,2115,20100529,B003987CL0,5,"May 29, 2010",AERQW3PJ9B7PG,A bit of a surprise,"I\'ve been using multi-blade razors for a long time, and found that I preferred Gillette over Schick, the latter diving me a smoother shave. I suppose there is a degree of subjectivity involved when you make a comparison with fresh blades. I remember that Consumer Reports was unimpressed with the vibrating Fusion when it came out, but I got one right away and liked it--even while aware that each \'improved\' razor came with ever-more expensive blades.Now there is the Fusion Proglide Power Razor. It makes claims of important improvements on what I would have thought was unimprovable--after all it is just a razor with a new generation (it claims) of blades.So the question is this: is there a positive difference?I read the information that came with the razor and on the web and was impressed by Gillette\'s audacity (for instance, a circuit board to keep an even flow of juice to the vibrator motor even as the battery runs down, and special groves to feed whiskers into the onrushing blades as the user draws the Fusion Proglide across a cheek!).I figured to keep it simple: fresh blades in my current Fusion and in the Fusion Proglide, one for each cheek; four down strokes over gel shaving cream on the left cheek for the Fusion and four more on the right for the Fusion Proglide. Little did my familiy know that my morning routine had become a major evaluation activity.Well, there is a difference. I like a smooth shave and this razor and blade gives the best shave that I\'ve come across outside of barbershop.I liked it and you might want to give it a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But for the first time since I started shaving almost 20 years ago, I can finally say I\'ve found a comfortable shave.  I\'ve been using Gillette products for several years now, always switching to the latest product.  Each one improved on the comfort over the prior, with the possible exception of the \'power\' versions over their \'manual\' counterparts.  But until now, I was never completely satisfied.

I used it for the first time yesterday and can\'t say I find it all that superior.  I did feel it left a smooth shave, but so does the Divine (3 blade version).  The handle felt no different as well, which is apparently one of the selling points to the Embrace since the handle has a bit of cushion and non-skid material.  The blade itself is fairly bulky, and can totally understand the concerns over it\'s size for more delicate areas with curves being more difficult to maneuver around.  The 5 blades are so closely stacked that it clogs quickly if you have more than 1 day of stubble to take care of.My biggest concern with this razor was that it had drag.  The blade cartridge has some \'special\' moisture strips or whatever they are meant to be that just grate over my skin.  It kept making me nervous that I was creating nicks up my legs!  I do have very sensitive skin, so perhaps this is why I didn\'t like the sensation of the actual cartridge, but I wouldn\'t imagine a well lathered leg (with Gillette\'s own shaving cream!) would create such a noxious scratchy drag.But, all this said, the razor gets the job done.  Once I use up the two cartridges/blades that comes with this razor, I will attach the Divine blades to it- which is a good selling point to have a razor that has the capacity to use all of the Venus blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

5593,1893,20100804,B003983HRI,5,"August 4, 2010",A7A3ETL1VSZCV,Gillette has done it again.,"Another outstanding product from the Gillette Company; a vast improvement over the first generation Fusion as the five blades are placed closer together making for a closer shave, especially around curves and corners.  I bought the extra blades with the facial scrub and the scrub really does make for a closer and smoother shave; however it\'s very messy.  My only complaint about the Proglide is the cost - it does not come as a free trial, and the replacement blades are very expensive; $3-$4 for disposable cartridges - ouch!

2360,1273,20100113,B0017WIL0Q,5,"January 13, 2010",AMFU1V62CY7W,Best Deodorant Ever Made,"My first deodorant ever was Old Spice and I used it for years thinking it was as good as anything else. It\'s not. Old Spice is an antiquated technology and it amazes me how they are still even in business when there is something so amazing as Gillette Clear Gel out on the market. You put it on and it stays on, it\'s completely invisible. With other deodorants you will begin to smell your body odor permeate through the inferior deodorant after a few hours. With Gillette Clear Gel, there is no body odor, ever. If I wanted to, I could go days without showering and it would keep working strong the whole time. The scents themselves smell fantastic, it doesn\'t smell like gag inducing cologne like Axe deodorant, it smells fresh. After a few hours the smell dies, but the protection is still there. I\'ve never had to re-apply no matter what I did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
476,486,20060211,B000BUUVTE,5,"February 11, 2006",A1OAN01CO11VIX,Best Razor Design,"I moved from a SensorExcel (2 blades) to this and this one is much better.I had a full face of hair (I hadn\'t shaved in about 4-5 days), enough to start a beard. One slow stroke across each section of skin with this razor was enough to clear out the hair with more precision than the SensorExcel could after 3 or 4 strokes.That is: a *new* SensorExcel blade in the same situation (4-5 days worth of hair) did worse and resulted in at least 3 cuts on average (whereas this blade resulted in no cuts). So clearly the new design helps. It does exactly what the ad says: spreads out the pressure of the cutting edges to reduce (eliminate in my case) the effect of your skin wrapping around the blade and causing cuts.But I believe you must use this blade SLOWLY. If you have the full face of hair like I did, that would be about 2 square inches per stroke, then wash. You can look into the blade and see very easily how full it is because with all those blades stacked so tightly together all the hair stays on the surface.This makes it easy to clean, too. Just run your thumb down the blades and you will easily unclog them. Compare this to the SensorExcel: once hairs were stuck in the abyss, they were usually there for good, requiring frequent blade changes. Hopefully this means the expensive blades will last longer (and thus prove to be worth the expense).This razor *is* an example of improvement via technology. I cannot agree that it is *revolutionary* but it is a good idea and it *is* the best razor design (I\'m comparing to double and triple razor designs, which I have used in the past). So it isn\'t the best on a revolutionary scale but it is the best.This razor\'s product execution was also an example of ridiculous marketing strategies gone over the top and if you want a laugh (or to be offended by the sheer obfuscation of information via distracting animations, interface, and sexual innuendo), I suggest checking out its website. The company could have made a greater profit had they foregone the ridiculously over-interfaced website because I doubt it convinced anyone. My first thought on entering was \'do I have to defeat the first boss before I can see their explanation for why a Power version of my razor is better?\' Along with the handle and cradle design, I would call it one of the most absurd and gaudy product executions I\'ve ever seen.However, the company luckily stumbled upon the best razor design in the process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeah, I remember. What a sensation! What a shave! What a waste of money. The expensive Mach 3 line has practically surpassed every razor out there in quality shaving and design. But it will never surpass the meaning of the word \'deal\'. And now, just a couple of years back, we were introduced to the Mach 3 TURBO, the special edition of a Mach 3 razor. Hmmm, silver all the way through. Shiny! Very dashing. Wow.....shaves well too, now that the three blades are coated to reduce friction. That\'s a relief! The razor has an evil price tag of about $11 canadian, and the razor cartridges go for about $10 for 4, or $19 for 8. I guess the Gillette head honchos needed a new fleet of \'Porsche Boxter\' convertibles and a few yachts. Well, if they get us to spend the money on their stuff, then we\'ll make them look richer than real estate dumbbell Tom Vu and Sly Stallone put together. I love a good, comfortable, gash free shave. And the Mach 3 is a terrific razor to get this wonderful shave I look forward to every morning. Mind you, the Mach 3 Turbo is just....well, too good of a razor. Kind of like an oversensitive Ferrari sport steering system. It\'ll get to every corner and turn...with scary precision. So, anti-friction coating or not, it\'s a serious blade. Yesterday, I went and bought the less expensive Schick Extreme 3, and even with it\'s three blades, it gives me a shave nearly as close as the Mach 3. Okay, so that\'s an A- shave, and not an A+. Still, the \'Extreme\' is a terrific razor, cuts the hairs well without leaving me the feeling that I have to be \'so\' careful with it, and is a much more reasonable price for both the razor and blade cartridges than the mighty Mach 3. Sigh. What\'s this world coming to? All this wasted money spent to find a razor that\'s a good price and gives you a great shave. Yeah....guess you could say that recently, I went to extremes.

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5768,2070,20100702,B003987CL0,1,"July 2, 2010",AU70G084OYMMM,Nothing special about this razor when compared to the others.,"I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age. The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better but that was always not the case. So I\'ll briefly compare this to the other razors I\'ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel. The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade. Thats all I have to say about that.The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner. Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same. So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave but I still decided to stick with the comfort of the Mach 3. So up till now the Mach 3 was my razor of choice.Now the story changes a bit:I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided. I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking I would never use anything else. BAD DECISION!!!! My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power. At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I\'m getter older so it\'s my skin\'s fault. I would get ingrown hairs and it was then embarrassing to go out. I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved. I tried various skin treatments to rid of the irritations and redness but nothing would work. The problem with the fusion was that the blades would only last about 3 shaves and then irritate the hell out of your face. ONE DAY I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY ANOTHER RAZOR.I then bought the Schick Quattro Titanium and boy was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion. It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever. They would stay sharp for months and wouldn\'t clog if a shave gel was used.(I know people complain that it clogs but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh it doesn\'t).Now Hydro 5 vs. Fusion ProglideHydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5. At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water. The shave was not as close as I would have wanted. The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge. Still I kept on using it since it came with 2 refills anyway. The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.Fusion Proglide: I bought the sneak peek package just to try the razor before it came out and all I can say is AWFULLLLLL!!!!!!! This time I couldn\'t even get one good shave from this crap. Turns shaving into gliding my A$$!!!! It\'s very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot. So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I\'ve ever used so far. The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind the exaggeration but you know what I mean).Final verdict: Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers. They are nothing but marketing now. Up until the Mach 3 they were my razor brand but the fusion and fusion proglide are nothing but scams. They look cool but I think they are face wreckers. Then again I have sensitive skin so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise. Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help. So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin. It will not clog with Zirh or Anthony Logistics shave gel and causes no irritation. The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates. Sorry for long review but I just had to share my experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6255,2565,20080127,B004B8AZH0,5,"January 27, 2008",A1VS1LL905P5L5,Hmm...so it wasn\'t just a gimmick,"I received these cartridges by mistake instead of the Mach3\'s ordered.  The idea of 5 blades that are battery operated to vibrate in an orange handle seemed like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Very gimmicky and overkill and bordering on kitsch.  But rather than going through the hassle of returning them I popped in the battery after rolling my eyes at this corporate invented need and gave it a try.  As much as I wanted to hate it, I found it to be a definite notch up the shaving food chain.  The blades are very sharp and the vibration somehow seems to allow the head to glide more smoothly and evenly over the beard.  The shave and closeness were the best I\'ve ever experienced.  Even the single blade on the opposing edge for maneuvering in tight crevices like under the nose worked perfectly.  All this comes with a cost.  When I surfed over to see what the cartridges actually cost I was horrified.  Soon they\'ll need to be locked in a glass container at the grocery store with an armed guard in front of the display.  Second, not sure if it\'s planned obsolescence engineered into the cartridges, but the blades seem to last only a few shaves, making them even more costly.  The blades being mounted so close to each other also make them hard to rinse and they clog easily.  Buying in larger quantities lowers the cost per unit somewhat.  Personally, I\'m hoping beards come back into style to create some downward pricing pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1784,685,20081228,B000BUUVTY,1,"December 28, 2008",ARVQ4KDMT0FS9,"Overpriced, poor quality blades","The replacement blades, which cost big money, definitely last very little time before they become dull. I thought I was the only one who noticed this and switched to a Braun electric razor but if you read the other reviews you\'ll see that other men have done this as well.I got the Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver for $199.99 about a year ago, and periodically (right now for example) you can get $50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $130.00. So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I\'m def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need. I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream (have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $40.00 for a years worth) and I never get irritated skin anymore.So now I spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 = $225.00 for the first year and a half I\'ve used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing= $565.00So Gillette Fusion, or comparable manual razors, cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor. Most men might not change their blades as often as I did but the things got dull so quick I don\'t see how it could be avoided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without this, I can shave in multiple directions (including completely against the grain), and still have annoying stubble from my upper neck to my chin. When I do take time and use this, however, I can get a close shave and get rid of that stubble only going through the area twice with the razor. I don\'t even bother moisturizing my face afterward since this gel does a great job of doing just that.

4261,1643,20090423,B001JQLNFA,5,"April 23, 2009",A4UFU4WKYEUGO,A Lady\'s Razor,"Nicely packaged. The blades are in little plastic capsules that sit inside a plastic housing with a lid. This is a big switch from most ladies razors I have tried. Because the blades are sealed, they don\'t loose their moisturizing gel every time you turn on the shower. The casing comes with a little mounting bracket that is not hard to place or figure out. I have really bad eyesight, so fishing around for a razor without my glasses on can be entertaining.The razor and stem are ridiculously feminine. It really does go right past any attempt at simple functionality and well into something a 14 year old girl would throw a tantrum for. It\'s marvelous. The stem is a very elegant swirly pearl color with all these interesting rubber bits that make it easy to hold. It is easy to hold. I think you\'d really have to make an effort to drop it regardless of how soaped up you get. But you won\'t drop it because you will not want to.The blades are surrounded by these wide pink lip like things that look, to be quite honest, like something you\'d find in a adult movie used by the goddess of immaculate hairlessness. They are squishy and smell wonderful. They also work quite well if you get them damp so you can have a safe dry shave, or touch up.The Venus Breeze razor is really over the top but does function quite well. I tried it out on three day old leg stubble and was left with baby soft skin. I like it. It\'s a private, sweet smelling indulgence that works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

The difference between the two is pretty significant. These are more expensive that the Sensors are but they last you forever. I found I got maybe 4 or 5 shaves max out of the old Sensor where I can use these blades for a good month and a half before I feel the need to replace them. The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.The comfort of the blade is by far the best I\'ve experienced. It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.The blade on the back I have found to be very useful which is something that, if I remember correctly, the Sensor doesn\'t even have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, the Venus Embrace does.It starts with the handle, which is coated with some new and soft gel-like material. Even holding the razor with wet and soapy hands is not a problem - the grip remains very secure, no effort at all.Using the Embrace is absolutely pleasant. For the first time since I began using such razors it didn\'t feel \'dangerous\' or as if my skin was being scraped - the new \'Ribbon of Moisture\' is a great and very noticeable step up from the previous \'moisture strips\' Gillette used. The 5 blades also feel totally safe. As a matter of fact they do what is advertised and feel like they actually adjust to the contours of the skin. I was truly impressed, because other razor models had made such claims before but I had never been able to actually feel that.Lastly, the results are equally great. I had used the Venus Vibrance before and find that the Embrace does a much better job. I can\'t stop touching my skin - it feels so incredibly smooth. The storage unit, the \'Shower Pod\', is nice and practical but nothing out of the ordinary and in itself not a reason to buy the Embrace.All in all, Gillette has definitely created a winner here, and I will stick with this model for a long time to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I found a secret that makes a blade last 4-6 months.  After shaving, rinse the blades well, knock the loose water from the blade by taping on a dry towel and then blow on it until it is very dry.  Shaving does not make the blade wear out---rust does.  Leaving the blade wet will lead to micro-rust in a few days so figure out how to dry it after using and it will stay very sharp for months.  Try it and you will see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6417,2728,20110525,B004QE83VE,4,"May 25, 2011",A30Z0GG96D11EO,Where\'s the hard case??,As always with companies they keep on rolling out new products at a higher price point and less bang for my personal buck.  I personally use the Venus Spa Breeze and loved when it first came out; a few years later and the novelty has worn off.  I find that they are not shaving as well as they used to and the \'bar\' on the actual razor head is not providing any sort of lubrication when it comes to shaving.Now onto the Pro Skin!  These come with a nifty little shower hook that suction cups to my tiled wall rather well.  What happened to the hard snap case that holds the razor in the front and brand new cartridges inside??  This was a big disappointment.  Where am I supposed to store the cartridges?  I hate when I have to separate things because I end up finding unused cartridges of a brand that I am no longer using and disposed of the handle a long time ago (HELLO INTIUTION).  After my initial disappointment and annoyance of that change I vowed to keep an open mind.  The shaving went great!  I found my legs feeling way smoother than they have in a couple of years.  The \'Moisturerich\' head really seems to work.  For me it did not drip or ooze; I think that may be a factor of how much water you are using and how long you are shaving.  My one complaint is that it doesn\'t do as well in the bikini area or around my knees because of the bar; but that is to be expected with this type of shaver.Highly recommend but wish that companies would stop skimping and charging more.  My husband actually commented on the smoothness & suppleness of my legs the very next day when he bumped my calf.  This lead to stroking my whole leg; at the time it didn\'t click that it was actually the Pro Skin razor.  I think I may replace my Spa Breeze with the Pro because at the end of the day I like my legs to feel as if they have been moisturized with lotion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4230,1612,20090521,B001JQLNFA,3,"May 21, 2009",A1V7889Z1SVIVY,Very pretty but...,"PROS:- Case that comes with the razor acts as a holder that can be on on the shower wall. (thought I wouldn\'t use it, but it is actually handy)-Very good around the kneesCons:-Not so good on underarms-Cant dry shaveAt first when I tried it on my legs it was pretty nice...very soft and I really liked the extra moisturizer around the blade.  I thought it contoured nicely, exceptially around the knees.  However, I found it less than idea for underarms and bikini since it\'s so big! It was hard to get everything.All in all, good razor but would probably not purchase because of it\'s size. Plus, you can\'t do a quick \'Dry shave\' under your arms because of the moisturizer around the blade.  I am going to stick with using my fianc&eacute;\'s mach 4 razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve progressed over the years from an electric razor to progressively a one blade, two blade, three blade, and now a five blade gillette - battery powered and otherwise. Have I ever noticed a major difference moving one to the next - not sure - but like many others of you I tend to buy the latest just to say that I have it.Shaving differences well truth be told the biggest revelation for me was when I switched from electric to the one blade gillette - I\'d used the electric for twenty years since the time when I had to shave in the first place. What a revelation! The electric took for ever and seemed to grind your beard down much like a power sander. By contrast the one blade hand gillette was quick clean and gave you the impression that you\'d actually had a shave in the first place.Since then I suppose I have detected minor improvements as I\'ve progressed from one blade to two and more etc. But the changes are only apparent initially and you soon just don\'t notice, and they are sure not as marked as the transition from electric to manual. It\'s a bit like the difference between an expensive bottle of wine and a slightly cheaper one, or a good hi fi system and a not quite so good hi fi system - the differences are suttle - but there sure must be a big difference between a one blade and a five blade gillette. The only \'primitive\' razor I\'ve tried recently is a disposable and it is sure streets ahead of that.Aside from the disposable I\'ve never gone back to a lesser (ie fewer blades) gillette to test the extent of the improvement - perhaps I should. Anyway it\'s a good, well presented, piece of marketing - and as I said like many of you I\'d rather have the five blade than many that went before.Oh and by the way I don\'t cut myself with the five blader as I have with previous fewer bladed models so there is something tangible! Perhaps that is a good pointer to a better razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After using the blade wipe it off on a towel and then cover the blade with a few cotton balls held in place by a rubber band. Then put the shaver in your sink drawer. You can easily have 3 weeks of use with this method. The reason why people\'s blades wear out in a week is because they dont dry off the blade and they leave it next to the sink. The moisture causes oxidation and dulling. The price sucks, thats why it gets 4 stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Legs and underarms are shaved very clear. Skin usually smooth.  Essentially, I have been a satisfied customer.Now, here comes a new razor, the Yenus Embrace. The packaging is very attractive, green with seafoam blue as is the color of the razor itself. One positive aspect of the Gillette products is that you can actually get into the product through the packaging without spending ten minute tyring to cut into the plastic. There is a perforated entrance in the back of the package that opens easily. This razor comes with a cute little round receptacle that holds the razor and attaches to the shower head.  All of this makes the razor attractive but the real test is whether the razor works well. The Venus Embrace has 5 shaver heads and gives the smoothest shave I have experienced.  I would buy this razor again in a heartbeat. There is a protective ribbon of moisture that provides a smooth glide. This makes the razor an A+ item in my opinion.Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-07-08",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1891,797,20070428,B000BUW8WM,2,"April 28, 2007",AORCXT2CLTQFR,Choose the manual version at all cost (see below).,"The Gillette Fusion is undoubtedly the best razor I\'ve ever used--not only does it give me an incredibly close shave but it also reduces (thanks to the five blades) the need to reshave. I must say, however, that the powered models\' great disadvantage is that the \'micropulses and vibrations\' feel fun but can increase the risk of razor burn, nicks and cuts if you lose your grip on the handle. The bottom line: get the manual Fusion over the powered versions for the smoothest shave ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6035,2343,20110408,B003EMVVMM,3,"April 8, 2011",AHCR4J99Q8QMX,Nerw Gilette Proglide razor blades,I have used these new blades for about a month now and see no appreciable value or benefit of these blades over the older outrageously priced regular fusion blades.  The only good news is that I am now seeing the regular fusion blades come down in price slightly.  I will go back to the old ones when this 6 pack is used up.  Amazon still is the best place to get them over any retail store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4252,1634,20090428,B001JQLNFA,3,"April 28, 2009",A2VZP50FSYD6CO,Unique Razor,"Venus Spa Breeze Razor has a unique feature - shave gel bars at the top and bottom of the razor that eliminate the need for shaving cream. It comes with a handle and two razor cartridges. The razor handle will hold all Venus razor cartridges, not just the Spa Breeze ones. The entire package was very easy to open and the razor handle and cartridges come in a nice waterproof container that can be stored in the shower, although it\'s not all that sturdy. The package comes with a bracket so you can hang the razor in the shower, however, I couldn\'t figure out how to use it. While the razor cartridge packages are conveniently waterproof, I had a hard time opening them and ended up having to use scissors, which damaged the shaving gel bar a bit.The Venus Spa Breeze Razor was just okay. I love the fact that there is a scratch and sniff panel on the front of the package so you can smell the shaving gel to see if you like the odor and the white tea scent was very pleasant. You need to be careful how you store the razor in the shower especially if you can\'t figure out how to hang it - put the razor face down and the shave gel bars are activated and the razor becomes messy to use. The handle fits pleasantly into the hand and the cartridges snap on and off quite easily. The shaving gel bars are a unique feature and work quite well, but don\'t expect lather like from regular shaving cream. The razor provides a nice smooth shave although I did knick myself a bit, causing my leg to bleed.Venus Spa Breeze Razor is an interesting concept that is perfect for people that may be traveling and don\'t want to pack shaving cream. However, I\'m not sure how long the shave gel bars last, which makes me a bit wary. In the end, I prefer regular razors and shaving cream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4238,1620,20090513,B001JQLNFA,4,"May 13, 2009",AHRNDSKWH1YBT,New spin on an old idea,"The new \'Spa Breeze\' version of the Venus Razor boasts the gel pack that surrounds the blades. I suppose the thought behind this is to make it easier if one didn\'t want the hassle of using soap or shaving cream. Having never had this problem, I am not sure of the actual need for this.Thankfully, the strip of gellerific goodness doesn\'t detract from the usage. It does, however, become quite \'goopy\' for lack of a better word after getting wet (especially when storing). Don\'t be like me and learn the hard way that this razor must be stores blades up or hanging freely.Other than that, it is light as a feather, dainty as all get out and smells like a flowering garden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

Super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything.  LOVE the vibration - it feels like I\'m NOT shaving.  No razor bumps.  I couldn\'t be happier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m serious people, you will not be disappointed with this razor.You can say goodbye to cuts and razor bumps with the Proglide Fusion. If you have a problem with razor bumps like I did, here are some tips:1. For the best results, don\'t shave for a week before the first time you use the Proglide Fusion. This will allow for many of your razor bumps to heal.2. Shave in a hot shower. This will open up your pores and make shaving easier.3. Don\'t press the razor hard to your face/neck. Use gentle short swipes as the super thin blades do not require you to gash your face in order to get a close shave.You should also note that this razor has a single blade trimmer on the back side for areas that require precision such as side burns and under the nose.The refills may be expensive, but they are worth it. You can use them several times before they need to be replaced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2345,1257,20120226,B0017WIL0Q,4,"February 26, 2012",AITSTVVMH51S9,Powerful but messy,"I got a 4 pack at BJ\'s for 10.99, so buying it on Amazon probably isn\'t the best buy unless you are unable to purchase it elsewhere. When I first opened it, it took me a good 5 minutes to realize that it wasn\'t one of the solid bar deodorants. I had no idea how to use it and it took me quite a while to figure it out. The turning mechanism on the bottom can be frustrating because when you first use it it is difficult to make it work. Another problem is that it is really messy. While applying it you have to keep turning the bottom wheel for more gel to come out which can get annoying. After you are done it really messy and easy to get on your hands, chest, and even the actual container. However it is a very strong and powerful deodorant. It felt great and I could smell it\'s freshness the entire day. Without applying too much even it worked exceptionally well. This is the first time I\'ve ever used a gel deodorant, and I think I might just stick to it. If it\'s possible you should buy an individual one before you get a multi-pack to try out. And this is OVERPRICED! Go to Costco Sams club or BJ\'s and you can get a MUCH cheaper price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve kept the original handle, but always tried out the new cartridges when they were released.  Now, this one has a solid soap on top and bottom of the razor blades, to take the place of your shaving cream.  I thought this would be good.I haven\'t cut my legs while shaving for probably 10 years...until today, when I used this razor.  Because the head is very wide (to contain the soap strips), it is difficult to see if you\'re actually cutting the hairs short enough, or maybe you\'re just cutting them \'shorter\' but not shaving them down to the skin.  I found myself pressing very hard to make sure the razor blades would reach the skin, and unfortunately, four times they not only reached the skin but went below it.I won\'t be using the Spa Breeze again.  But maybe this is just me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I never cut myself, and with the little gel strips on the top and bottom you barely need shaving cream for the first few uses (but, use it anyway- it\'ll last longer). These razor blades will last for months if you need them to. When I don\'t have the money to throw at these things I have used one razor for months. It\'s not the most comfortable shave you\'ll ever have but it\'s better than a four blade lol. These certainly are expensive but if you shave quickly, or tend to cut yourself it will be worth the expense.Tip: When you\'re done using it, don\'t place it blade down on anything. The gel strips will be used up much more quickly and will attach themselves to the surface they are placed onto (don\'t worry, not permanently).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After trying their Custom Plus3 and being extremely disappointed, I decided to give Sensor3 a try. They are exponentially better than Custom Plus3, but they still don\'t come close to the original Custom Plus as far as the quality of the lubrication strip and overall comfort are concerned. The razor tends to drag on your skin, leading to razor burn. Why Gillette can\'t use the same quality lubrication strip on Sensor3 as they do on the Custom Plus twin is beyond me. I would also prefer a non-pivot head to give me better control over the shaving angle, but that\'s more of a personal preference. It does not do all that great of a job on the chin and directly under the nose. The angle of the blades does not allow for good surface contact in these areas and can lead to nicks. Also, for my beard, each razor is single-use regardless of the brand, so I need to get the most bang for my buck. These come in a bit on the high-priced side, so that reflects negatively as well. I\'d give it 5 stars for the quality of the shave, subtract one star for the price factor (Amazon\'s price here is *ridiculous*! You can easily get these for 30-40% less in any store, but that is still expensive on a per-razor basis) and subtract one more star for the not-so-great lubrication strip (better than Custom Plus3, but still not as good as it could be). Overall, I will continue to use these, in conjunction with the original Gillette Custom Plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1746,647,20091207,B000BUUVTY,5,"December 7, 2009",A1UEP1T9TLTTO5,"Works good for me, lasts practically forever","Here\'s my take on razors in general: not all men are the same. Some have thick fast-growing hair, some thin slow-growing, some medium thickness fast growing, etc. Everyone\'s different. Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don\'t need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it\'s what works for them.So far, these Fusion Power\'s are the best for me. My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors. The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3\'s came out, and the Mach3\'s were equally tossed when the Fusion Power\'s arrived. The reason - the 2 blades hurt, I cut myself lots, and wore out in one or two uses. Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut. These Power Fusions However, I must emphasize: *have yet to cut me*. I think the vibrate function is to thank for this, but I\'ve yet to cut myself when the battery runs out either, so it may just be the blade.Here\'s what Gillette does not want you to know though: these things last a LONG time. You can use one blade for months with minimal degradation of the blade quality, as long as you use the vibrate function and cream. How do I know they don\'t want you to know this? Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they\'d like, and so there\'s a whole marketing bend they\'re on about checking your indicator strips to see if it\'s time to replace. My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn\'t as quickly disposable.That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me. No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I\'m barely buying one pack a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

I have been using Mach 3 Turbo since almost 4 years and they give me the most comfortable shave. I saw these blades on Amazon for much lower price than the Store bought ones so I thought of giving it a try. They turned out to be fake. I could tell that the moment I started the shave. The Gillette use and throw razors work better than these... I will never buy these online again.. I will continue using the Mach 3 Turbo\'s store bought only... Well worth the money and you know what you are getting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You put on the shaving cream, you wet the razor, then you move the cutting surface around on your face and behold the hair is removed.  The face is shaved just as it was with three blades & power, three blades & no power, two blades, I even remember shaving with a single bent razor and that worked quite well.  And with all those other razors I didn\'t need a second mortgage to change the razor cartridge.I like the feel of the handle, I like the battery indicator, I like the new design, but seriously the increase in the quality of the shave isn\'t enough to justify the cost of the replacement cartridges.  At just under $15 for 4 pack, just under $30 for and 8 pack I\'ll stick with my Turbo Mach 3 razor, where I can get 8 cartridges for $7. I\'ll use the 4 cartridges I have and wait for the price to come down when Gillette comes to their senses in about six months.I\'m glad I have it; I look forward to using it when it loses its newness on the market and the price comes down, and then I\'ll be one of the cool kids.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

Overall, I thought the razor was really good. I have very sensitive skin, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn\'t have a razor burn from the 5 blades.  However, having been forewarned about that possibility, I used a lighter hand than I do with a 2 or 3 blade model.  I love the feature of letting it hang in your shower. Very nice with small children so I don\'t have to worry about it falling off the shelf into their reach.  I also could tell a noticeable difference with the moisture strips. My skin felt very smooth after just one use.  I like that the pivoting head made it easy to shave underarms and around the knees without knicks or remaining hairs.My only complaint, as one other person mentioned, was that the excessive amount of plastic on either side of the blades makes for a lot of extra work.  You think that you\'ve already shaved a certain part of the leg, only to realize that you must have only gone past it with the plastic. It ends up feeling like you\'re covering the same area more than once, which is somewhat annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

There are 5 blades, all parallel to each other, which is the secret to the close shave. Each blade is sharper than the one above it. The first blade, which is the least sharp, functions to pull the hair out of the follicle a bit, then the second blade cuts the hair and pulls on it some more, then the third blade cuts some more and pulls the hair out even further. Finally, before the hair can snap back, the fourth blade moves in, and cuts the wily hair to infinity. My theory is that the fifth blade is just a marketing ploy and it really doesn\'t do anything. So, if you are willing to spend the money for the closest shave ever, buy this product. Or, if you are out of work because of the economy, you should get a Bic razor from Wal Mart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I couldn\'t be happier. It\'s small, lightweight, easy to use and trims very well. I was worried that the single AA battery wouldn\'t last long but it\'s still going strong after several weeks of use. It easily fits in my medicine cabinet and doesn\'t need a recharger cord which would dictate that it stay on the counter.Overall I\'d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, inexpensive trimmer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I went back to a double edge razor recently. I found unless you have a top quality blade in a DE razor, you do not get a smooth close shave. With a Trac II blade, you can count on a smooth, slick, close shave everytime. It seems that 2 blades work better than 5 blades or even 3 blades. When Gillette made the Trac II razor blades they made perfection. They still sell  razors for these today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though it neither possesses zillions of blades nor vibrates, it shaves closer than razors that do. Cartridges for it are also slightly cheaper than those for the Mach 3 or other high-end razors.These 5-count packages (bundled in packs of 2) are also a phenomenally good deal, especially if you purchase them using Amazon\'s subscribe-and-save. My only complaint is that, in these bundles, the blue lubricating strip normally at the top of the razor has been replaced by a white and noticeably less lubricating version. Still, this is a good buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well I\'ve used the three, four, and five blade versions and to be honest the difference is very minoot. I do however notice some difference in going from a two bladed razor to one of the three, four, or fives.

What do all of these (and many more) have in common? They all have the little rumble strip before the blades. The rumble strip (i\'m sure there is a more formal name) probably results in a smoother shave for many people, but for me the result is simply a bloody head.If Gillette every stops making these, I don\'t know what I will do.

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

The second thing I found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the Mach III, and with very little effort, and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore.

I lathered up and was amazed as the razor glided effortlessly over my face and through the stubble, giving the smoothest, most comfortable shave that I have had. Not a bit of drag or irritation was experienced, so I let my beard grow for a week, thinking that this time it would fail the standard it now set. To my amazement, the shave was still superb with no irritation. I finally tested it by shaving daily with the same results.Concerning the lubricating strip, it is a definite improvement, being more slick and lasting longer while the handle allows a more secure and comfortable grip than its predecessor. I\'m still on my first blade after 4 weeks and the shave is still very comfortable. The single blade at the back of the blade head does a great job especially above the top and lower lip, and the soft blue glow of the power button does add a cool touch. Shaving was done with the power feature on and off, but either way the shave is excellent.Overall, Gillette definitely has a winner here with the Proglide Power Razor. I\'d definitely recommend it, so give it a try and I\'m sure you won\'t be disappointed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have the Venus \'Vibrance\' and am quite happy with it, but decided to try the \'Embrace\' out of curiosity because I cut myself so often with just about any razor I use.  At the same time, it seemed like something with five blades would definitely cut closer and get most of the hair without having to go over multiple times and irritate my skin.  The question is, does it really hug to your curves and get all of your hair in one shave and leave skin smooth?  Yes, it does do a pretty decen job of doing these things, but I didn\'t feel it is a whole lot better than my three blad vibrance blades, except that it shaves just a little bit closer, which is nice.  So, overall, if you have sensitive skin, this might be a good razor for you.  If you like to just shave over an area once and expect to get all of the hair, this is about as close as you will get to that.  God Bless ~Amy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1830,733,20060212,B000BUW8WM,2,"February 12, 2006",A17SEG3RJJ8O8S,"Overhyped, Overrated","The way some reviewers are raving about this razor really makes me question their integrity. There is absolutely no way this is a 4- or 5-star product. I call shill.I\'ll start with the few good things about the razor:1. It feels very nice in hand. The \'grippies\' are in just the right place. It has a nice heft with the battery in. The size and shape fit the hand nicely.2. It looks very cool. I really like the orange and grey/silver meme that has been going through design the past few years. If anyone watches you shave, they will be impressed seeing you with this. However, I, for one, typically shave alone so this isn\'t worth much.3. The battery level indicator is very cool and effective. It\'s hard to describe, but I wish everything I own that uses batteries had this indicator.4. The single blade on the back of the razor is brilliant. It\'s not as effective as I\'d like, but it is much better at keeping a sharp sideburn line than the five blades. I suspect the angle/ position will be worked out in the future.Now the bad:1. It doesn\'t shave any better than any other razor I\'ve ever used. Yeah, it gives a pretty close shave. But my tried and true Sensor Excel blades, the handle of which I purchased in 1996, give just as close of a shave without any of the other problems listed below.2. It\'s very expensive. $30 for 8 cartridges?! Ridiculous. Absolutely not worth it. The Sensor Excel 8 pack is literally half the price - still more than I think they are worth - but gives a better shave.3. I\'ve never had a more uncomfortable shave. The blades catch my stubble, making for a very slow shave. Yes, of course, shaving with the \'grain\' of your beard reduces this problem but it still happens. Most people have swirling grain somewhere on their face. This razor makes shaving those areas very difficult and slow going.4. The blades have a short lifespan. I am only able to get 3-4 shaves out of a head before the stubble-catching problem gets so bad I can\'t use it. By contrast, my Sensor Excel blades easily last 7-8 shaves - about two weeks, though by the 7th or 8th shave it is catching pretty bad too. My straight edge doesn\'t have this problem at all, given a quick run over the strop before each shave.The overall experience is expensive and uncomfortable and results in a mediocre shave. It is a disappointing product and not worth the investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

The problem is, other razors are really unpleasant and I wind up with cuts. I won\'t go into specifics as to which those brands are, but let\'s just say I am not going to try them again anytime soon. I actually prefer the Original blade mover all the others, but the Divine came up on sale, and I found out I don\'t mind tham at all. Unlike the Breeze which has these really big gel bars which I found to be unpleasant and uncomfortable once the gel bars were gone, these little moisture strips are not so strong or slimy to cause much notice.

It\'s all sizzle and not too much substance.  Don\'t get me wrong you\'ll get a good shave, relatively speaking.  But I\'ve had better shaves with other less costly razors. I\'ve used the Fusion, both manual and power, and the Mach 3.  After shaving for a number of years with both Fusion power and manual, I\'ve detected no difference between a \'power\' shave and a manual one. The Proglide is no different.  The \'power\' option with battery and all sounds great, but doesn\'t work at all.  It\'s a placebo and an expensive one at that.I\'m going back to using Mach3.Here\'s a tip that has really served me well:  use hair conditioner rather than shaving foam, and you will get a much closer shave.  At first, I didn\'t believe a friend of mine when he gave me this tip.  But it\'s true.  I get much closer shaves.  And the other great benefit is that your razor blades last much, much longer.  Instead of a razor blade lasting me for a couple of weeks, tops, when I use foam, my blade is good for six to eight weeks when I use hair conditioner. Needlessly to say, now I only use hair conditioner for shaves.  And I don\'t have to tell you, this translates to not only getting great shaves, but to saving a lot of money!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ever since the original release, the blue ones, I rarely try other brands anymore.  The thing that I find a little unusual about the Moisturerich blades is how close they seem to resemble the Breeze blades which are some of my least favorite blades. The moisture gel feels slimy, and while that might switch to smooth after you rinse it away, it\'s not a lather and not at all pleasant while using it. Like the Breeze, the gel is used up rather quickly unlike the Embrace which lasts awhile.This isn\'t a bad a blade since it still shaves close and doesn\'t feel like you\'re scraping your skin, but the other blades just work better with less fuss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2317,1229,20110217,B0013MTHWQ,5,"February 17, 2011",A2SB0OKNB1ODN5,Closest shave I\'ve ever had - and no nicks!,"These razors give the smoothest, most comfortable shave I\'ve ever had. I can run the razor over my skin fast, with very light pressure, and it still shaves perfectly. For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area. With every other razor (even the Breeze, which was my prior favorite) I had to slow way down and go carefully or I\'d nick myself in those spots. So I can shave faster! I shave in the shower, and I don\'t find shave gel or foam to be necessary.My problems with razor burn and bumps in the underarm and bikini area are over. Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions. With previous razors I had to shave those spots repeatedly in different directions, using a lot of pressure, to get a close shave. That lead to painful razor burn, and so most of the time I just tolerated a rough shave there. No more! I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure. Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.There are two things I don\'t like about the Embrace cartridges:Cost: They\'re expensive! But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher cost.The size: They\'re big. The only reason this is a problem for me is the shower pod: Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they *don\'t* fit in the Breeze shower pod.  I ended up buying an Embrace starter pack with a handle and shower pod so I could store the cartridges in the shower pod.  I didn\'t realize until I opened the starter pack that the Embrace shower pod only holds *two* cartridges. So when you open a 4-pack of cartridges, you\'ll have to keep the extra cartridges somewhere else. One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else. It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \'cute\' over making it useful for storage. At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall so it doesn\'t get knocked onto the shower floor and stepped on.(Another reviewer reported that the shower pod keeps detaching from the wall. I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn\'t get bumped and rarely gets splashed. It\'s remained firmly attached for months. I also have a fiberglass shower. I don\'t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy tile.)Summary: The Embrace cartridge gives a truly superior shave. It\'s worth every cent.EDIT: April 11, 2011: Wouldn\'t you know it, shortly after I wrote this glowing review I got a bad batch. The bad cartridges didn\'t shave as smoothly and I had some mild razor burn with them. They also seemed to dull more quickly. Since the bad batch I had tried another box and they worked well again. I am not changing my five-star rating yet, but I will be paying attention to whether the bad box was a fluke, or a warning of quality control problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2091,1000,20080327,B000XVSNTQ,4,"March 27, 2008",AM004PHO6F3FZ,"No surprises, just clean smooth legs","The latest Venus razor, \'the Embrace\' has just hit store shelves with promises of smoother, easier shaving.  What\'s different?  5 blades!I\'ve used most of the Venus products, thinking (erroneously) that I was leaving less plastic in a landfill by buying a razor with replaceable blades.  The first Venus promised \'the legs of a Goddess\'.  That one had 2 blades.  Somewhere along the line, they\'ve gone to 3, and now 5 blades.  There was even one that took a battery and vibrated a little bit!  But I digress.Out of the box:  a razor, an extra blade package, a suction cup mount for the shower wall.They were truthful, this razor will give you a close smooth shave.  The pivoting head keeps you from cutting yourself, and yes, this works well.  The \'moisture strip\' ensures a smooth glide up your leg.  Its quick, feels nice in your hand, and I got smooth, goddess-like legs without a lot of effort, and without having to stem any bleeding.  5 stars for shaving efficacy.I like the moisture strip because it allows the razor to glide smoothly up your leg without \'skipping\' or scraping.  It seems silly and maybe even gimmicky, but compared to a razor without one, the moisture strip is amazingly helpful.The little plastic gadget is meant to suction cup to the shower wall.  It opens like a little door to reveal a spare blade set.  Nice idea, but it wouldn\'t stick to my shower.  And when it falls off it blows itself to smithereens.  Earlier versions had double stick tape, and the suction cup idea is far preferable, if only it worked.Compared to disposable razors, this is far superior.  It works better, and you don\'t cut yourself.  Compared to other Venus razors, not much difference.  I like them all!  I\'m not convinced that 5 blades are necessary (unless you are a yeti) but all things being equal why not?All in all, highly recommended, watch for a sale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6037,2345,20110213,B003EMVVMM,4,"February 13, 2011",A1XU7R26EEOHOE,Better than the Fusion Power Blades,"I want to give it a good 1-2 months of use before I wrote a review about them. In short, are these new Fusion Proglide blades better than the previous Fusion Power/Manual blades? YES.The advertised thinner blades do make a difference: these is less drag and effort applied when I shave with my Fusion Power blade handle (you don\'t need to buy the new Fusion Proglide Power shaver to use these new blades). I find the shave to be much more comfortable and enjoyable with these new Proglide blades than with the Fusion Power ones I\'ve been using for the past 2 years.Is there a significant difference between the Proglide Manual and Power cartridges? Not that I can tell and not enough for me to fork over the extra money for them. The battery-powered handle makes the difference in the shave in my opinion.Another reviewer mentioned that blade maintenance makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE in the longevity of your blades, and that is true. Always clean your blades with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol after each shave to remove the mineral deposits left by your sink water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

5795,2097,20100609,B003987CL0,3,"June 9, 2010",A2ZINQBNNYPF0P,No better than Fusion,"With the claims of a revolutionary razor, I believe most of the hype to be exactly that, hype.Took a shower, washed my face. Applied Gillette Fusion shaving cream and tested it next to my old Fusion. No difference, what so ever. The \'larger handle\' is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size. The shave was no closer, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide. Having said that, I can\'t complain, they sent it too me for free.It\'s an excellent marketing ploy designed to influence Americans to buy whatever product big businesses want us to buy next. Having said that, I see no reason to switch from my old Fusion to newer and more expensive cartridges. It received three stars due to the promises made by Gillette, and the fact there older products are just as functional as this newer, more expensive one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5891,2197,20100919,B003987CL0,4,"September 19, 2010",A1YXEYOWESHVLJ,Great shave but expensive blades and unnecessary vibrator.,"I really didn\'t want to like this razor, the ongoing gimmickry has become increasingly annoying. However I have to admit this razor gives a really comfortable shave. The ergonomics are the best I\'ve come across, well balanced, correctly angled head, substantial weight with battery installed.  The five-blade cluster is more than just gimmickry, it provides a wider shaving area, which is more stable as you shave. The vibrating gimmick is just that, however. It seems to add nothing to the shave and it completely eliminates any tactile feedback, which I find necessary for a good shave. New blades are quite expensive, usually $3-$4 each, pretty steep but you may find the comfort of the shave is worth it (I\'m still unsure). To sum up, pass on the powered version and go with the cheaper \'manual\' version and be prepared to pay a lot for new blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is definately a keeper and my husband can use it too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shave from these blades was awful; in fact my previously used blade worked better. I reported these blades as possible counterfeit to Gillette, in turn they replied:\'At P&G we are committed to protecting the consumer from counterfeit products. We work closely with legitimate retailers to ensure only genuine products are offered for sale and that the supply chains are safe and secure. We recommend using caution when purchasing products through channels such as flea markets, market stalls or the internet.  If a deal looks too good to be true, then it probably is.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us.I\'m sorry in general we don\'t compensate for alleged counterfeit products because it\'s not our product, you may want to contact the retailer where you purchased it.\'I don\'t know how the internet can be compared to a flea market, but when I\'m buying from Amazon I am not digging through used garbage no one wants. Not sure if this is a standard most companies have for purchasing items online, but I was disappointed at P&G\'s response. Since the internet has boomed, and the fact I live overseas, shopping on the internet has become a must. Seller did however offer a refund.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though they were fun to try -- they all had cons to them like the the gel/soap around the razor being slimy and lasting only a week, which meant spending a lot more $$$ on razors than i would have liked to.In the end i returned to the classic Gilette Venus. Not only is it the cheapest razor from the Gilette Venus line,  but it also leaves my legs silky smooth. In order to achieve the most silkiest feeling legs i rub body butter on my legs after the shave/shower.The razor itself is great. It is really hard to  cut yourself, unless you go up or down with the razor sideways-- this will result in a clean cut, but it will be deep and will bleed.  Leaving the razor in the shower/bath will make it rust/dull faster due to the moisture so make sure to wipe off the razor after your shower and store it away (even if it is in a drawer) it will prolong the cartridges life. Also when it dulls it will leave your legs not that smooth and with little stubble -- so don\'t forge to change those cartridges.This box does not come with a razor, it is just the cartridges and each cartridge is individually packed. It is simple to replace the cartridges on the razor, just pop off the old cartridge, open the new cartridge packet, and pop the razor into the new cartridge. Done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I smell noble price here!Don\'t let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn\'t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the \'adding more blades\' thing is getting exhausted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

I had a 3 day shave and it hurt my skin. However, for a daily shave it is good and its easy to rinse in the water.

The Venus was well above other \'ladies\' shavers\' in quality and performance from the very beginning, but this version is even better. The shaver is smooth on the skin, down\'t cut or nick even in tough spots like behind the knee or in the back of the ankle, and it shaves better and faster. To my surprise, I also found it to be much gentler on the skin, and can be used comfortably without the shaving gel - which is a plus because the gel makes shaving much messier and longer and shortens the life of the blade.Well done to Gillette. Now, if they could only make the packaging a bit more eco-friendly! I\'m surprised that they still use so much plastic, considering how many conventional (i.e. not natural) brands have made some kind of effort to improve/lessen their products\' impact in the environment. That\'s why I\'m giving it 4 stars instead of 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fusion ProGlide is not the answer.The best part about the ProGlide is that it never cuts the skin. I\'ve used them almost every day for almost 2 months without a cut. I don\'t think I can say that about any other razor I\'ve tried.The downside is that I can never get a close shave with these blades. No matter how many times I try or how many different directions I shave the same area, it still feels a little stubbly. By the end of the day, I feel like I need a shave again. Should we have to shave twice a day?I think I\'ll go back to Sensor Excel and deal with some cuts in order to get a closer shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is space to hold 2 extra razor heads, and (this is true beauty to me!), the additional heads come sealed in their own protective plastic.

They give a great close shave & the blades don\'t get dull as quickly as most razors I\'ve tried.For a good shave, wash skin before shaving, then hold a HOT towel to the hair/skin area you\'re about to shave. That will soften the hair and open the pores.I also recommend Kiehl\'s brand \'Blue Eagle\' or \'White Eagle\' shaving cream. It\'s about $20 a jar but it\'s by far the best shaving cream I\'ve used. It\'s so thick you can even reshave each area many times without getting razor burn or irritation.Using cold water on the area after shaving will close the pores more quickly and help avoid razor bumps and dirty pores, etc...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

It\'s no better than the M3 Power razor I have. The difference in closeness of a shave was minimal to nonexistant, more closely bordering the latter I\'m afraid. On top of which, the new head design renders shaving with the grain, or the downstroke, completely useless. And the detail trimmer on the back of the head is dull and useless right out of the packaging.The single improvement this razor has over the last generation is that the handle of the blade is more comfortable in the hand and balanced better. The downstroke is useless, the upstroke is the shave. The total shave is overall the same except that I can\'t use the downstroke at all anymore. And at the jacked up price they\'re pumping out these beauties at, it\'s not worth anything at all. I\'ll stick with my M3 Power. Sorry Gillette.

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I\'ve been a happy Gillette Fusion Power user for years so incorporating the razor into a trimmer, with good looks and Gillette quality was a no-brainer for giving it a spin. Well I just used this tonight (trim and shave) and it works great for both. I\'m totally happy with it and for under $20 for a top tier razor and trimmer, with a great design (especially coming right out of the gate with this brand new product), you can\'t go wrong. Highly recommended. I paid about $18.74 at Walmart and they\'re sold out now. People know and love Gillette!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1906,812,20061203,B000BUW8WM,5,"December 3, 2006",AEMZRE6QYVQBS,Mind the innards.,"I shaved off my beard for this razor, shelved the electric razor, and find myself passing my hands over my chin in amazement several times in the course of the day. The five-blade Fusion is that good.\'Fact is, you might want to take out some extra insurance on the esophagus. Close means *very* close in this case.The nice thing about an economy that spins out choices like a five-blade razor is that you don\'t *have* to buy it. Gillette\'s earlier products will clean you up just fine, not to mention comparable razors and blades manufactured by the Other Guys.But if you want close to mean \'as close as it currently gets\', you might want to invest in the Fusion (a small investment) and the replacement blades (a large one).I have often suffered an irritated face while shaving with a blade, one of the reasons I moved to a beard and an electric shaver some years ago. But so far, in the thick of the Midwestern winter, I have yet to feel any irritation.The battery-powered, chip-driven gizmo may be overkill, I must admit. I seem to get as good a shave from the Fusion with the power off as with the little hummer humming away.Factor in the cost of the blades. Then, if you still want a shave as close as it gets, the Fusion would be the thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5877,2183,20101114,B003987CL0,5,"November 14, 2010",A1BVDUVRIX24VT,The best shave this side of a barber shop,"When I was younger, I used electric razors, Norelco and Braun types, and thought they were fine; I was a bit intimidated by manual shaving. Then when I got a older I disliked the fact I could never shave very close with those razors, leading to afternoon beard shadows. Plus, it was hard to do anything like trim a smart goatee or sideburns, not to mention the heads would wear out periodically, and were expensive to replace.Finally I moved to shaving cream and manual razors, and it was like graduating to the big leagues, or moving from an automatic transmission to a stick-shift. I felt more in control and got a much better shave that lasted all day. But with cheap razors I found I\'d end up with nicks and irritations no matter how carefully I shaved. I\'m the type of shaver who goes against the grain; otherwise, I\'d never get close enough (my beard grows pretty fast).I\'ve tried most of the hyped-up Gillette and Schick razors over the years, and while they were a definite improvement over the throwaway kind, they were never all they were cracked up to be - I just figured razor technology had gone about as far as it could go, and adding more blades or a gimmick like battery power were just oneupmanship between the two major brands to win market share.That is, until I decided to give this Fusion Proglide Power a shot. I should say right up front, I\'ve not used the non-power version, so I can\'t comment on whether the vibration is a gimmick or does something useful. But I will say I haven\'t had a better shave except from a barber! The basic razor (and especially the starter kit) are not expensive, for what they are. The \'hidden\' cost, of course, is the price of the blades (and the Fusion creams if you choose to use their brand). This could be a big drawback for some, but I value the comfortable, nick-free shave this razor gives me and the extra cost is worth it.In my experience, the only better shave you can get is from a straight razor or good safety razor with the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush. But that makes a mess and is hard to master. I was actually going to try that route before I bought the Proglide... now, I don\'t have to! This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well. I\'m used to having to dip my razor in the water, tap it hard on the back, or some other way to unclog the blades after every few strokes. Not so with this one. Maybe because the blades are thinner? I don\'t know, but it just seems like it never clogs, even with some heavy growth to mow. That\'s another big plus in my book.I dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \'system\' of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave. I think those products are overpriced and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well. But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars. Do I wish the blades were cheaper? Sure. But I don\'t mind paying for something when it\'s actually worth the extra money, and to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money. Good job this time around, Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless.  Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head.  When compared to the Mach3 which you had to use for this area the closeness is not even in the same league.  That\'s my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I\'ve used.  My only con is how damn expensive the blades are.  I\'m trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that\'s about the best I can do. That works out to about $6 a month just to shave.  I\'m going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices.

511,521,20100424,B000BUUVTE,1,"April 24, 2010",A2I4UMOUOS5AUD,Terrible,"I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it\'s no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn\'t bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I\'m going to calculate the number of shaves I\'ll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5882,2188,20101026,B003987CL0,5,"October 26, 2010",A1EAUBJPAYJ1XW,A Qualified Five Stars,"Here is the scoop after one week of use.I use to make jokes about the 5 blade razors.  Then I bought a Gillette manual fusion and stopped laughing.  It was awesome with closer shaving and the blades lasted one month for me!So I just purchased the Proglide Power Razor.  My \'qualified 5 star rating\' is given because the improvement of this razor over my first 5 blade manual Gillette is no where near the improvement seen in moving from the 3 blade to 5 blade system.  There is no night and day difference.  I would not be surprised if the razor by Gillette testing is an improvement.  But the difference I believe is too small to discern for an average user.  It may come down to whether you like the vibration.  I will say that I have not determined if the vibration helps prevent the buildup of hair between the blades which is feasible.  Nevertheless, I love this razor.  It is entirely optional whether you use the power capability or not.  And relative to my older manual 5 blade the handle on this Proglide is much more rounded and comfortable.  It is not heavy at all and in fact is likely very light yet solid if you remove the battery. So I would recommend giving it a try and figure out for yourself how you prefer to use it.  My one caveat at for this early review is that I have not been able to determine how long the blades last but do not expect that to be significantly different, and if I am not mistaken the older blades still fit as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

That is, you need to apply this at bedtime in order for it to work optimally.  The package insert explains why -- applying the product before you sleep allows it to \'form better plugs\' -- which, while disgusting-sounding, is how antiperspirants tend to work -- the aluminum compound plugs and temporarily deactivates your sweat glands.  So your armpits will also feel kindof nasty and coated when you go to wash them next, but so it goes with this type of product.  The package insert also explains that the aluminum compound in this particular product is different from that used in most antiperspirants, and that it allows for less irritation and better performance -- I can\'t really speak to the accuracy of those claims as I\'ve never experienced irritation or problems with other brands.The scent of the product is mild, and quite unisex.Overall, this product does what it says if you follow directions -- but I\'m not sure I\'ll use regularly as I\'m not fond of the way it makes my underarms feel.

2036,943,20080411,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 11, 2008",A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,Smoothest Shave Ever,"When Gillette released the Fusion 5 blade razor for men years ago they revolutionized shaving yet again.  Changing the angles of the blades and adding 2 extra, it seemed slightly ridiculous, what was next 15 blades?  But upon using the 5 blade wonder from Gillette I quickly found that the hype was worthwhile and the end result was the greatest shave I had ever gotten.  Smoother, quicker, and with less irritation then I ever had before.  I tried going back to the Mach 3 but it was impossible, the stakes had been raised.  It was only a matter of time before a womens razor with 5 blades would be released, could the magic happen again?You bet it could.Being in martial arts I found the benefits of shaving areas that men don\'t usually shave as opposed to staying hairy all over (go ahead and insert your metro sexual jokes here) and have used a womens razor for years so I know what I am talking about.  With the edition of the lubricant outer edge, the aforementioned 5 blades, a comfortable grip and a shaving station to put your razor back, this newest invention by Gillette truly is a work of art.  Razor burn is a thing of the past and irritation has been sent out to pasture as well.  My wife loves the quality of this new razor and her legs lasted smoother longer.This is one of those cases where once you try you can\'t go back.  The new Venus Embrace is a lights out home run of a product that exceptional.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is handy for shaving tricky spots such as the area under the nose and between the upper lip. That being stated, I have not noticed a more comfortable shave with the micro pulses. Also, five blades has not reduced the number of required strokes when compared to the three on the Mach3 Turbo (the number of strokes is the same). Finally, the frequency of having to replace the cartridges does not justify their cost. After only three shaves, the cartridge needs to be changed. The blades for the Mach3 and Sensor product lines last longer. If you shave daily, do not upgrade to this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have all the products - the Merkur\'s safety razors, the Gillette Fatboy, and as assortment of straight razors from Dovo and Thiers Issard.  There is nothing more that I enjoy than lathering up my Rooney silvertip badger and shaving on a weekend morning.  However, for those quick morning shaves before work I always turn to my trusty Gillette, ranging over my shaving career from the Sensor Excel to the Mach III to the Fusion and now the Proglide.  I have to say, each has been an improvement over the previous, with the newest generation being the best.Gillette loves to throw in the marketing gimmicks - the \'enlarged lubrastrip\', the \'redesigned precision trimmer\', the \'micro-combs\', and the \'thinner, finer blades.\'  All of these are just lovely ways of saying - hey, we are not giving you a different colored fusion razor like the phenom or racecar or matrix of whatever they called the other Fusions.What I can say, is that somehow with all these \'innovations\', they have managed to minorly improve an already stellar razor.  It does what it says, it glides better on your face.  It have me a 9/10 shave with one pass with the grain in 1 minute of time with no irritation.  You maybe able to get a 10/10 baby butt smooth shave with a Thiers Issard straight blade with a careful four pass 15 minute shaving, but who has time for that!  And it has less tug, less drag than the fusion.Gillette has always been the King of shaving.  The Fusion has put all other over the counter modern safety razors to shame.  This just follows their precedent.  Yeah, it is a Fusion razor with a blue LED light and some minor changes.  But hey!  It\'s great.  It is an all around great razor.  The Proglide will now be my new go to razor for the prework shave.  I give it four stars because it is a great razor, it\'s the best on the market, but it isn\'t perfection.  Gillette is striving towards it.  I want that 10/10 shave.  That may be too much to ask.  But is Gillette thinks they\'ve gotten it complete figured out, they\'ll stop trying.Good job, Gillette.

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

Their Sensor3 blades work fine, so of course they\'re becoming scarce. The racks in stores are filled with their new, more expensive products that don\'t really work that much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

A move comfortable, smoother shave for me. I could hardly feel the silky way it removes hair. I had to check some of the strokes to see if anything was happening. I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal. Fushion is quite a bit better. I was surprised. I like the reverse side feature of one blade for under the nose. All Gillette razors give you a shave, but if you are going to shave every day, this is the most comfortable and nicest feeling one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is virtually fragrance free, goes on very smooth, feels light and silky, and disappears into a clear layer that doesn\'t mark your clothes. It keeps you absolutely dry and odor free all day. While the label says to apply the night before, I always forget, but it works perfectly anyway. I\'ve used Mitchem antiperspirants for over 20 years. This is the first product that works just as well. It is a powdery cream that actually feels softer and smoother going on than any other product I\'ve tried, probably due to the multitude of tiny openings in the metered delivery system and the very wide application platform. The instructions say to use 3 clicks, but I use more - hardly any comes out in those tiny clicks!Depending on price and availability, I just might keep using this for awhile instead of Mitchem for no other reason than the very smooth and soft feel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which if you are not aware, Amazon will give you a refund if the price drops within 30 days of when your order shipped.Now as far as the razors go, you simply cannot beat the quality and bang for the buck of Mach3 Turbo. These razors easily last 10 shaves at least for me and cuts in very few strokes as you all should well know by now.I recieved a Gillete Fusion online months ago and tried it and I can say safely that it has no major advantage over the Mach3 line. Are you interested in the sideburn trimmer? If so, than maybe Fusion is for you. If not 5 blades are not better than 3. Beware though you will have to pay at least double the price for half the cartridges.Stick with the Mach3 Turbo especially when it is at $10 or less for 8 cartridges. You simply cannot beat the quality and bang for the buck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

5770,2072,20100630,B003987CL0,5,"June 30, 2010",AUV3OR951650C,"Wow, REALLY, REALLY smooth!!!","Since I am the wife reviewing this awesome razor, I will share both my husband\'s viewpoints and my own! I was so glad to be offered something that my husband could use... but I had my doubts about the battery powered razor, and the price of the refill blades.First from my standpoint:  my husband was using the Gillette Mach 3 before... a good razor!  Now that he switched over to this one, his face is REALLY much smoother. I mean a HUGE difference... not just a little bit! I certainly don\'t mind, it\'s definitely for my benefit (no more grizzly bear)! :)Now for my husband\'s take: Even when he hasn\'t shaved in a week, this razor blades gives a smooth cut the FIRST time through... no more going over the same area two or three times because he has been lax in his shaving! This thing REALLY works, and works fast, and gives the ultimate cut while it\'s at it!!!  Really, really nice! He also loves the detailed cutter on the top of the blade to get precision cutting... comes in real handy!Overall, we both recommend it hands down, and we will be tossing the old razors away for this one... and paying the extra for the refills on this one... it is most DEFINITELY worth it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2073,982,20080331,B000XVSNTQ,3,"March 31, 2008",A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW,"Too many blades, too little comfort -- a demonstration that less is sometimes more","My wife tried this razor and was not impressed.  Her exact words were that \'it felt like I was dragging a football field full of blades across my legs.\'  The \'moisturizer strips\' didn\'t do anything that she could detect.  She used her three blade razor on one leg and this on the other, and, on a blind test, I determined that the leg shaved with the three blade razor felt smoother.  And the Venus Embrace left her other leg looking red and irritated -- it felt a little roughed up.  My wife pointed out that the huge \'moisturizer\' surrounding the blades makes it impossible to do any fine trimming.  Also, she didn\'t like the shower mount or the amount of packaging on the \'shower safe\' replacement blade.  It seems wasteful.  And who changes the blade in the shower instead before starting the water?  Sometimes less is more, and fewer than five blades certainly seem do to a better job for shaving.  I imagine the replacement blades are quite expensive.  But that\'s Gillette\'s business model: hook them with a razor and then clean up on the blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4000,1376,20090618,B001F51QJ8,4,"June 18, 2009",A26R7LLAFTPC3U,Not perfect--But darn close,"I perspire quite a bit but generally gravitate towards the inexpensive/sale deodorants.  Since that generally means I use different deodorants, I\'ve also found that I am fairly sensitive too--some deodorants (that don\'t brag about being strong) will irritate my under-arms.  That\'s not a good combo--to be blessed with genes that make me perspire more than average, yet be sensitive to many deodorants.So, enter this Gillette Clinical Strength.  I had both very high hopes (that it would solve my odor issues), yet was a bit worried that, especially since I had never used anything Clinical Strength before, that it would surely irritate me in some way.To my surprise, everything seemed great.  It\'s basically odorless, goes on smoothly and doesn\'t leave any residue.  Thankfully, no irritation whatsoever, to my surprise.  On a day to day basis, it covers me all day long with no odor (which is way above and beyond many deodorants I\'ve tried).The ONLY reason it didn\'t get all five stars is because I can occasionally tell that it didn\'t fully cover me; but only when I\'ve been doing a decent amount of physical work or been in the heat.  Perhaps I\'m asking too much, but for me, the perfect five star deodorant would be able to get me through a 24-hour period even if I did a decent amount of physical activity.Even though I\'m a very frugal person, and although I was \'manly\' enough to occasionally break through this deodorant, I will certainly pay a premium for this deodorant in the future, as it works better than all the other many brands I\'ve used.  Good job, Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

71,74,20110109,B000052YIN,5,"January 9, 2011",AQOEV79T09JVQ,"Good Shaving Cream, Good Price","I\'ve been using this cream for some time now and I just realized I was able to get it in bulk packs and subscription services. I hate going out to the store to buy things like this (mainly because I wait until I\'m out), so the subscription is good. If you are like me with 5 men in the house, you can probably use the six cans pretty easily. We aren\'t even that hairy of a bunch, so your mileage may vary based on your level of wolverinism and the number  people you have.In terms of the cream itself, I\'m a big fan of foam over gel as you don\'t have to wait for it to foam, you get a better idea of how much you are using and I think it works better to lubricate and hydrate the face. Gillette\'s is good at all that. I don\'t have sensitive skin, but I\'ve always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.Everything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream. Great if you have a lot of guys around (better yet if they are particularly hairy).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s better than Mach 3 (easier to handle), while maintaining the same smooth shave.

161,167,20111216,B000065AB0,5,"December 16, 2011",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,Better than the Schick Quattro,"***Note: I added this review from the regular Mach 3 since the actual starting system is nearly identical to the regular Mach 3, just this one has an extra lubricating strip on the blades. I go between the two as far as replacement blades and whichever is on sale. They are pretty similar, and either of the blades actually fit on either the razors.I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago. I have since tried a few new models thinking that perhaps one of these new razors might work better... but I keep coming back to this razor.The Mach 3 is so far, the only replaceable blade razor that I have found I can easily, properly shave my head without nicks and cuts. The blades tend to wear fairly quickly compared with the Shick Hydro 5, but what is the use of longer lasting blades that slice my head to ribbons?The grip is a great improvement on the Sensor XL, more heft, better wet grip. The blades are easy to attach and remove. They last me a couple of weeks on average, but I shave my head every two to three days and shave my neck below my beard every day. That\'s a lot of use.I did start using a new shave gel and it works magically with the razor. No more issues with serious gumming up of the blades. Check out King of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.. It\'s expensive for a shave gel, but nothing works better for shaving my head and preventing the shave gel/cream from gumming the blades.I know the replacement blades are expensive, and many third party sellers are reselling stolen merchandise... but that\'s part of why they are expensive. Those of us who are buying the blades on the up and up are paying for all those stolen and re-sold packages. So I just recommend buying from a store or trusted seller rather than eBay. Also watch for replacement blades not sold in retail packaging. Often these are either knock offs or have \'fallen off a truck\'. Spend the extra $5 and make sure you are getting the quality blades from a reliable source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

They seem to be made of cheap black plastic, I could swear the ones I bought in retail stores felt better made.  I dropped my razor in the shower recently and the metal tabs that hold the whole thing together bent and tweaked the cartridge -- this had never happened in years of dropping store-bought Mach3s.  And it might be my imagination but it seems like I am needing to change blades more frequently, as if the blade is a poorer grade metal that dulls or corrodes faster.I can\'t prove it but I suspect Gillette is trying to phase out this product to steer consumers to a more expensive update, and is manufacturing a cheaper version for guys like me who cling to this product in hopes of avoiding the more expensive update, but the spotty quality will probably push me there eventually anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I saw the item locally so I purchased it with the intention of shaving with it first thing in the morning.  I am currently a Mach 3 user and I love it so I wondered if this Fusion thing would make a big difference.  I honestly feel that the shave with the Fusion is of the same closeness at the Mach 3.  However the Fusion has a HUGE bonus the extra blade (six) on the back of the shaving headto hit those stray hairs that remain under the nose that the Mach 3 normally misses.  Also it is much easier to trim sideburns with the Fusion because you do not have to worry about hacking off a huge chunk with the mass of 3 blades with the Mach 3.  A bit pricey and if the razor came at the same price as the Mach 3 I would commit to the upgrade, (Very Hard for guys to change hygeine products, we love the good old reliables).  If you do not have a Mach 3 then I recommend purchasing the Fusion.  Bottom line: Close shave, nice sideburn and stray hair trimmer, nice overall design of the handle, and a good looking razor.

6455,2769,20110322,B004QE83VE,2,"March 22, 2011",A1VABWDOUQLULZ,Don\'t buy the hype,"I\'ve used razors in the Venus line off and on for years, as well as other brands that have built-in moisturizers, so I was curious when I saw Gillette had created the \'Pro Skin\' razor.  There are two cartridges in the package, along with the razor handle and suction shower hook.  The hook fastened well to my glass shower, and has clung since without problem.  The tortoise shell packaging has an easy-open flap in the back, which is nice.  I find the individual packaging of the cartridges a bit overkill, but I\'m not a big fan of packaging, in general.The cartridges slip onto the handle easily enough.  I noticed right away that the installed cartridge is a bit bulky. After dampening it, I found the blades were quite sharp, leaving a smooth, close shave.  My dislike of the Pro Skin razor is that it doesn\'t shave curved areas well, because it\'s so bulky you can\'t shave tight areas, and the gel bars drooled.  They were kind of gross, actually, and dripped down the handle of the razor.  That said, the gel bars left my skin soft and feeling as if I\'d put on lotion.  If you don\'t enjoy that sensation, these razor won\'t be your favorite.  By the time I had completed shaving the bars had worn down quite visibly.  I expect the Pro Skin will suffer the fate of other such inventions, which is the bars will wear down far in advance of the blades becoming dull.  Also, I can\'t imagine storing the razor any way other than on the shower hook.  It would leave a terrible mess laying flat.In short, it does a great job shaving, but for the mess and bulk of the gel bars I won\'t be running out to buy one.  If you need a smaller razor, stick to the original Venus.  If you need a moisturizing razor, spend the extra $4 and get the Intuition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And that makes all the difference.,"I have tried so many razors in my year of shaving, and I think I have found the right one. When I first started shaving, about a year ago ( I\'m kinda new to this), I used my moms pink plastic cheapo gillettes that come in packs of like ten. These sucked! Everytime I shaved I would get a new Nick or cut. They didn\'t get all the hair, having only two blades, and irritated my skin. Next, my stepmom bought a pack of cvs brand rip offs of the bic soleil. I thought I was in heaven. These didn\'t Nick quite as much, and had a grippier handle, so there were no slips. I honestly liked this razor, at least compared to those two bladed ones. Then my sister decided to buy herself a Venus spa breeze. I admit to trying it once of twice. This was an even better shave than the cvs ones. The only problem I had where those big shave gel bars. They were slimy and left residue on my legs. I still liked the shave though, but didn\'t want to spend money at the time on sething I wasn\'t completly satisfied with, so I went back to the cvs ones. Finally after hearing my friend raving about the Venus embrace, I thought I\'d try it out. It wasn\'t that expensive, and if I didn\'t like it, I just wodn\'t buy refills. So I bought it. I was in love.The 5 blades cut a little bit closer than the cvs brand \' soleil\'. I didn\'t miss any hairs, even though I only took one pass on each section. I even got a close shave on my knees, thanks to the pivoting head. I also found that my shave took a lot les time. I was done in about half the time it usually took me. I didn\'t even get any cuts.The ribbon of moisture works great. My legs are less irritated than before and it really gave a smooth shave.The soft grip handle was a comfortable fit in my palm. I wouldn\'t say it was grippier than the cvs, but it was certainly a step up from the gillettes.The only thingni felt was not nesasary was the shower pod. Idont keep my razor in the shower anyways, because my younger sis has a tendancy to steal and use my razor. With a razor like this I knew she would want to try it out. The razor is tucked away safely in my room, with the pod in my junk drawer.I give this razor five stars. I am definitly buying the refills.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

1827,730,20060222,B000BUW8WM,4,"February 22, 2006",A3M5SH898GPMWW,Gillette Fusion Power has pluses and minus over Mach 3 Power,"I have a thick beard. I shave daily. I have been using Gillette sensor-series products almost exclusively since the Gillette sensor debuted in 1990.I graduated from Sensor, To Sensor II, to Mach 3, to Mach 3 power.I normally shave wet, with no shaving cream, and with down strokes, although I use some upstrokes. I have tested the Mach 5 both wet and dry, with no cuts or major problems.I have used the Gillette Fusion for 1 week, and here are my findings.Pluses:1) An overall great shave.2) The Fusion shaves better dry than any previous Sensor model. (Although I rarely have a reason to shave dry).3) More blades. More microfins!4) The plastic handle, while bulky, is very nice. The plastic is gentle to the touch, aa nice departure from the rigid, cold metal of the M3.5) Comes with a coupon for $2 off additional cartridges.Minuses:1) The confort strip wear out WAY too quickly.  My Mach3 blades last 3 weeks, My Fusion blade needs replacement after 1 week. Hopefully, the replacement blades will be better than the original ones (if so, I\'ll edit this review).2) Since there are more microfins with a larger area, and sincen the microfins become more imporant to the overall shave, the microfins trap more hairs than ever. Even washing the blade doesn\'t get rid of all of the microhairs trapped in the microfins.3) The 5 blades make upstrokes more difficult and don\'t offer the precision of the M3 and previous models for the tough spots (e.g. under the nose). On the soft ares of the face (e.g., the cheecks), the larger footprint makes it harder to press close and cut hairs close to the skin. However, this problem is somewhat offset by the additional blades and microfins.4) As always, the blades are more expensive than previous version. At this rate of inflation, Gillette blades will cost $50 each by the year 2030. =)Overall, it is a great product. I am undecided if I will keep using Fusion or switch back to the M3 as my primary. I might use both together (as I previously did with the M3 and Sensor Excel).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know I get an extra blade out of the deal, but based on what was advertised, and what various sources suggested, this discrepancy made me immediately suspicious.However, upon close inspection of the blades themselves, they seem authentic- A real lubricating strip, the little \'fins\' at the bottom of the blades resume their original shape after being pressed, the blades are in good alignment, are clean, and have what seems to be dots on them indicative of authentic Gillette manufacturing.  Even the boxes have evidence of being machine-glued, and not hand-glued. One test I haven\'t actually tried is shaving with them, but at the moment, I\'m convinced they\'re the real deal.So, I appreciate the free blade, Razors N More, but please- In such a counterfeit-saturated market, I think it would be best to stick to the letter of your product description.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I usually exercise in the morning and shower immediately thereafter.  I figured after showering, this would not be effective for the remainder of the day.  Much to my surprise, I did not need a second application and it still provided better wetness reduction than any other antiperspirant I\'ve used in the past.  The scent is similar to baby powder.

I compared the mark with my old blade and that one had the Gillette mark too. And on top of that the shave from this blade is harsh. So this is confirms that the blades are fake.I rarely review products but I just wanted to share my experience.NEVER PURCHASE GILLETTE BLADES FROM THIS SELLER. THEY ARE FAKE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does shave very close, but not closer the other 3 bladed razors I have used.  After the 6 months of use, I found that it shaved very well until I had to shave over the edge of my jaw and chin where it failed to give a good clean shave right under my jaw-line and chin with the first stroke.  I found if I try to shave closer, I got to many nicks.  I only got a close shave in those areas after I lathered up again and shave agaist the grain, but at times I did get razor burn doing that.  With out question, my old Gillette Sensor Excel with it\'s two blades did a much better job with only one stroke.  The Sensor Excel seems to huge the surface of my face much better, and the Mack 3 Turbo seems not to keep all 3 blade in contact with my skins surface when going over my jaw and chin.  All in all, I would have been happy with the Mack 3 Turbo\'s shave, it\'s great looks, and I really love the new handle.  And most of the time, if I shave slower I got a great shave after lathering up again and shaving against the grain.  However, I was not happy at all with the way the blade got dull so very fast, and there not cheap!  This is by far the biggest disappointment with the Mach 3 Turbo and the reason I give it only 3 stars.  It\'s also the reason I went back to my Sensor Excel until I got my new Gillette Sensor 3.  I think the Sensor 3 shaves just as close at the Mach 3 Turbo and does ever better in the problem areas under the edge of my jaw and chin.  The Sensor 3 blades are about $1.00 less per pack and last much longer then the Mach 3 Turbo Blades.  And one more good thing, I can use both Sensor Excel Blade and Sensor 3 Blade with both my Sensor Excel and new Sensor 3!  I\'ll keep the new Sensor 3 at home, and keep my old Sensor Excel in my travel bag to use on my many camping and fishing trips, vacation or when ever away from home.  I would recommend the Gillette Sensor 3 over the Mack 3 Turbo because of these reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not to put too fine a point on it but if a razor doesn\'t julienne my skin during the process of removing hair, I\'m satisfied.I was was somewhat stupefied when I opened the package and discovered that the handle had no loaded cartridge--the analogy that occurred to me was Carolyn Jones as Morticia Addams snipping off the heads of flowers. This, if it wasn\'t an oversight, struck me as kind of cheesy. I used the razor on my legs and underarms, without lather, and it did a good job and allowed me to retain my epidermis. I really don\'t know how long the lubricating action will last but I\'m sure it will continue to perform just as well with lather (I should add that my body hair is sparse and fine and doesn\'t dull a blade very fast).Speaking of cheesy, the oh-so-classy, \'sure you can spare it?\' holder-on-a-suction cup that\'s useless on a bathroom wall with very small tiles would have better been left on the drawing board. Other than that, the Gillette Venus Proskin Moisturerich (a lot of syllables for such a small item) performs as advertised, at least on my kind of hair.

I have sensitive skin and I\'m always complaining about not getting a close enough shave without tearing my face up, so when I saw the commercial for Proglide I decided to give it a go.  It\'s sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.  I\'ll say this, it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  When I\'ve waited a few days before using, the Proglide is a dream.  It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  Sadly, I\'ve noticed that if I shave two days in a row my skin gets irritated and the shave is nowhere near as close.  I know that some consider the battery operated vibration to be a mere gimmick, but having used a razor with the same capability for years I have found that my shave is always closer WITH the vibration, and I\'m quick to replace the battery because of that.  Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it\'s worth it (as far as I\'m concerned).  When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.  All in all, I like this product.  It delivers most of the time; I just wish it were always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The color of the handle is different from the Fusion and it comes with a now ubiquitous blue light to indicate that it is working - just in case you happen to fall asleep during shaving. The blade separation looks different and the hair trimmer is certainly easier to cleaner than previous incarnations of the five blade format. But the shaving process felt no different and the results were certainly no different to my present Fusion electric razor. So I put a new blade in the Fusion and did - to the extent possible - a subjective side by side comparison of the Proglide and the Fusion. They seemed the same to me.We all know that the Gillette - now P & G - consumer model is on the blade replacement rather than the razor - but this version of the 5-blade seems to lack sufficient advancement in the technology to provide a better shave, The New Yorker columnist,  Adam Gopnik, actually wrote a nice piece on the razor wars that can be found as \'Reflections, \'The Fifth Blade,\' The New Yorker, May 11, 2009, p. 50 [...]The Proglide would fit right in with Mr. Gopnik\'s conclusions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Get what you pay for I guess.If you want the best, smoothest shave on planet earth with minimum irritation and you don\'t want to spend more time in the bathroom tending to your face than your wife? Then this is your razor.If you want to shave with a piece of flint, save a few bucks and thumb your nose at the system? Not my problem. Will lesser razors shave your face? Yep, especially if you like nicks, cuts, razor burn, multiple passes, shaving against the grain, re-shaving, $20 shaving creams, $80 shave brushes, pre-shave oils, soothing aftershaves, witch hazel, styptic sticks, hanging out on internet forums wondering what you\'re doing wrong, etc... And if you can find the economy in that, let me know.Did I mention this razors performance in more private areas? Nothing even comes close. And electric personal groomers are poor in performance by comparison.As for the cost, for me this is a non-issue. I can get months out of one cartridge relatively easily and with a little common sense that seems abundant out here in the woods, less so in the city. Therefore, this and other razors of its type (Mach 3 innovation) are no more expensive to me than a \'classic\' double edged razor which I have as well. It stays in the drawer mostly.

Pricey but a great splurge A++,"Okay so I generally use Gillette 2 blade disposables from Sams Club. I ran out and went to the supermarket. I haven\'t used the Venus razors in years.  Well Venuse Embrace were on sale so I decided to splurge and get it. The rubber handle is great and you can easily hold your grip on the razor. The moisturizing strips are awesome and really make it glide smoothly. You almost don\'t even need the soap (but I still do soap up). If I miss a spot, I can just go right over it without re-soaping leg. I have sensitive skin, so I was worried the five blades would irritate me but its been great, no irritation. Also these blades are lasting a long time. I\'m onto my 5th shave (both legs(thigh & calf) and underarms)and I\'m still getting a great super close shave.  These are definitely pricey, but as a splurge I\'d get them again and recommend to others. Also the little shower caddy does actually work. I was just going to throw the thing out but decided to try it. I figured I would toss it if it fell off. So far its been good and staying place. This is a nice bonus since I can keep the razor out of the reach of my 2 year old daughter. I did keep it on a ledge but it was always knocked down. This was a perk I didn\'t anticipate, so it made me feel a little better about the price LOL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a great deal for the price.  $4.20 with free shipping.  I have used these shavers for several years and I like them.  I'll use this one when I travel.

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I really didn\'t think this Gillette Fusion Proglide upgrade would be much of an improvement, but to my surprise it was.  I found the razor actually gave a better shave than my previous Gillette provided.The new Proglide is smooth and did the job without punishing my face.  I can shave in the shower without a mirror and the razor glides gently over my face without missing a spot or nicking my skin. If there is one downside to using Gillette Fusion razors it would be the high cost of replacement blades. I suppose one must pay the price for quality and inovation.The new Fusion has a feature that my previous one didn\'t.  The on/off switch is lighted.  OK, that is no big deal, but I really appreciate it because my nearsighted eyes can easily locate the switch to turn off the razor.I recommend buying the Gillette Fusion Proglide even if you already have a previous model of the Fusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6401,2712,20120208,B004QE83VE,4,"February 8, 2012",A2JJO0DNB4QV0O,"Great, for as long as they last","As many others have pointed out on the page for the refill cartridges, the \'shave gel\' bars on these razors don\'t last very long. One wouldn\'t expect them to last for months, but more than a 2-3 showers seems reasonable at this price point. The blades themselves are good, though, and last considerably longer after the moisture bars have worn down, so it can still be effectively used with shaving lotion -- which, of course, defeats the point of this skip-a-step design. I gave it 4 stars anyway because it *does* -- for the first shave or two -- do as promised, give you a simple nick-free shaving experience without using any additional gel/lotion/cream. Also be aware that they\'re superior to \'normal\' razors primarily just on long, smooth planes of skin, like legs or forearms. In smaller or less flat areas the moisture blades may not actually be able to make contact with your skin because, by necessity, they do not sit exactly flush with the razor blades. (Aside: other reviewers have said they\'ve gotten these cartridges to last longer by mounting the storage hook somewhere other than the shower, i.e. someplace dry. Will try that and report back.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The turning point for me was, when the battery eventually leaked and corroded the internals (handle grip).  Tried the cheap (U$70) Philips battery operated travel-shaver for 6 months.  Unfortunately, I still missed the close-shaves from the blade shavers.  Finally, I took the plunge again - this time the Fusion Proglide Power.I have since been getting good results from it.  Maybe it is just psychology, but I feel that it had a closer shave compared to the Mac3 Power.  So far, after weeks of daily usage, I have not had a blade-change yet.  What I like was the flip over edge, to get a closer cut especially under the nose area, and below the lower lips.On another note, it did not shave too well when I use it with the Fusion HydraGel Moisturizing Shaving Gel.  Perhaps the Gel is too thick and the blades are floating rather than getting closer to the skin.Overall, it was a good investment for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1852,755,20100322,B000BUW8WM,1,"March 22, 2010",A34UVV757IKPVB,PAINFUL.,"Gillette is the mafia of shaving.  I mean, really, if you\'re a man and you\'re reading this, you probably already own/use Gillette products.  It\'s a given.  They really are the best.  They are also really the MOST EXPENSIVE.I used the regular Gillette Fusion for years now - and just made the \'leap\' to get the Fusion Power.  Why now?  I mean the blades are ridiculously expensive as it is, what\'s another buck or two on top of that?!Tried it for the first time today.  It works well.  The vibrating is a bit weird - it\'s like a hand massage while you shave.  Shaving doesn\'t feel like shaving.  That vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with.  It certainly is painless to use.  It worked well - my skin is smooth.  No telling if it\'s smoother than the regular Fusion.  How could you tell?  I don\'t know if it\'s a gimmick or what - but I did like it.  I\'ll continue to use it, since I bought the darn thing and have no choice.~ EDIT 4/23/2010:  I now hate this thing.  Here\'s why: Within one or two shaves, the \'lubricating strip\' is completely gone.  After that first shave with a nice new blade, it hurts like hell to shave with.  It\'s as if the vibrating effect speeds up the wear and tear on the blades!  It\'s horrible.  It truly is.  On the weekends, after a couple days growth, shaving with this thing is horrendous - I\'ve never had a more painful shave.  The vibrating thing is just a gimmick: aside from that first shave with a new blade, it\'s not nearly as good as the other non-vibrating shaving razors out there.  I find areas all the time that it just did a horrible job on - rough spots.  I can\'t use it on my upper lip - because the vibrating makes my lips chap!  Even turned off, shaving HURTS with this thing!  I\'m throwing it out.  I had this old spare new Schtick razor I keep around and shaved with that a few days ago - WOW.  It\'s awesome!  So smoooooth.  The vibrating thing is a total sham, folks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For someone who dreads shaving because every excursion results in a bloody nick, this razor changed my view entirely.The handle attaches to the head at the bottom, leaving the head to swivel naturally with each body curve.  Most razors have the handle attaching at the top of the razor so mobility is limited.For the first time since I started shaving my legs, I did not come away with nicks, cuts, or scrapes.  The multiple blade head seems to float over the turns and curves of the body and gives a close shave with little pressure.I also liked the enclosed shower pod which holds the additional blades and keeps them dry yet handy.  Nothing worse than having to leave the shower to get a new razor.  The pod has stuck in its original place so I haven\'t had problems with it falling off the tile as have other reviewers.Overall, there isn\'t anything I can say that I didn\'t like.  So, for women who have tried waxing, lotions, or other razors, give this a try.  I don\'t think you\'ll be disappointed.

When compared with my old razor, the differences between shaving experiences were minimal at best.For one week, I shaved one side of my face and head with the Fusion, and the other side with my regular razor, the Schick Xtreme 3.  I am black, with tough beard hair, a shaved head, and a fumanchu moustache. I shave in the shower and wash my face before shaving.If you shave your face and head, I recommend you skip this razor.  For shaving the back of the head, the balance of the razor is awkward at best.  For shaving the rest of the head, it was no better then any other good blade.For shaving the face, the balance was good, but that was about it.  There was no difference in irritation between the two blades.  The lubricating strip faded to white after about four shaves, meaning you are no longer getting what Gillette calls an \'optimal shaving experience.\'I tried to trim the chin area between my fumanchu moustache. It did a horrible job, no matter how careful I was and the area was left feeling extremely irritated.Consider the Mach 3 over this razor.

1847,750,20060130,B000BUW8WM,4,"January 30, 2006",A3CFD4WF57VKEV,The New 5 Blade Fusion,"I had read about this razor and being a bit of a shaving fanatic myself, I waited patiently for my local store to get the razor in stock.  When I finally spotted it, I imediately purchased it, took it home and tried it.  So, does this razor live up to the hype?When I came home and took the razor out of the package I was glad to see that the battery (1-AAA battery) was included but I was a little put off that it only came with one razor cartridge.  I figured from past experience that there would be two but only one???  The razor itself has a decent weight and a nice shape so I quickly got over the fact that there was only one cartridge.I brought the razor in the shower, washed my face and applied my shaving gel and was preparred to be wowed.  I turned the razor on and it came to life with a solid hum.  The power button on it seems to be better than the M3Power\'s because it protrudes a little less and it seems less likely to be accidently turned off while you\'re shaving.  That being said, I began to shave.  The first thing I noticed about the razor was the size of it\'s head.  It seems rather large in comparison to the M3Power or even the Schick Quattro blades.  Even though it did seem bigger, it didn\'t seem awkwardky big and I was still able to shave without it being cumbersome.  The razor cut clean and smoothly though my beard and gave quite a comfortable shave.  The blades easily rinsed under running water even though they are spaced quite closely to each other.  I noticed on a few of my problem spots I still had to take multiple passes with the razor so in spite of having five blades, it couldn\'t perform miracles!  There was the single trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge too but it really didn\'t seem to be very functional.Overall I was quite satisfied with the quality and comfort of the shave.  The question that I have now is that, in spite of a good shave, is this razor worth the extra price versus say, the M3Power or the Schick Quattro?  Locally the refils go for about 30% more than the other \'older\' razors so, there is a signifigant price difference?Personally, I\'ll continue to use this razor for a little while and look for the cartridges to be on sale but I honestly don\'t think the Fusion\'s shave is that far superior to either the M3Power or the Schick Quattro to justify paying that much extra.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mach 3 side was just fine.That burning sensation must me the shave was closer/better right? Wrong. Both sides of my face are equally smooth from both a visual and tactile inspection.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

I have tried all the other Venus type blades in the past and have never ever sliced myself. Venus blades have always been a no-fail go-to razor blade! Never cut myself once until... These are like using a deli meat slicer-EVERY TIME. As some of the other reviewers suggested and I agree, you can\'t get a close shave unless you push too hard and then it\'s like the shower scene in \'Psycho\'. That being said, if you do try to use them, the shower gel pads eventually fall off long before the razor has dulled. Then it\'s even more difficult to use!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6388,2699,20110620,B004B8F8MM,4,"June 20, 2011",A329WJEOBESSZ,Great Shave...Just Expensive (But Less So on Amazon),"Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience. They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion Power blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there were a few issues I had.First off, it\'s a bit messy. You twist the bottom and sometimes it comes out, sometimes it doesn\'t.Sometimes you just have to keep twisting. Once you apply, if you put a shirt on right after, chances are it\'s going to get on the shirt.The first day I somehow got it on my hands after putting my shirt on and went to eat breakfast. Didn\'t taste very good.Secondly, when showering the next day it leaves an odd waxy residue that literally has to be rubbed off (it catches your finger).But I suppose that\'s why it\'s such a powerful antiperspirant and deodorant.Both are fairly non-issues, but are important to consider if looking at all of your options.If you can live with it being a bit messy, it\'s definitely a very powerful deodorant and antiperspirant.At the current discounted price it\'s around 4 bucks each in the pack of 6, which is a bit expensive-- but it\'ll definitely keep you fresh all day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4263,1645,20090423,B001JQLNFA,4,"April 23, 2009",A23GFTVIETX7DS,"Great for travel, works as advertised, but . . .","The Gillette Venus Breeze is a lightweight, three-bladed razor with solid lubricant that obviates the need for shaving cream or shower gel.  All you have to do is wet it and begin shaving since the soap-like pieces above and below the blades turn to a clear substance the consistency of (sorry!) mucous as you shave.  The handle is molded to fit comfortably in your hand, although the weight feels more like a disposable.This pack comes with two sealed blades -- airtight so as not to dry out the lubricant.  Herein lies the first problem:  instead of a neat row of blades in a small holder, you get individual pods.  For this reason, the packaging is bulky, and it seems like a very non-green approach to razor blades.I use a Gillette Quattro as my primary blade, so I compared the two.  I used the Venus Breeze without soap of any kind, and I used the Quattro with my usual Dove Body Wash.  The Quattro shaved slightly closer, although this wasn\'t obvious until the second day.  My skin was noticeably drier on the Venus Breeze leg, however.  The best news is that the lubricant worked since I had no razor burn or other discomfort while shaving.I recommend this razor primarily for travel when you don\'t want to take cream or gel for shaving and you can pop a pod into your bag.  Because the lubricant is solid, you don\'t need to put anything in the airport carry-on quart size bag, which frees up more room for other items.This razor works exactly as advertised, although I suspect it will end up because more expensive than most choice simply because of the cost of replacement blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4384,1770,20090530,B0028K3IZY,3,"May 30, 2009",AISSIRI0N0I57,Gillette. Not always the best a man can get.,"For me this deodorant/anti perspirant is not the right fit. It doesn\'t really matter what the product states it can do as it all comes down to personal preference. Here\'s my two cents:The pluses:Can\'t see it. It does stick to its promise in that it doesn\'t show on your clothing. Black or otherwise. (if you accidentally put on too much then it will show)While I did find that the scent hits you very strongly at first it does tone down shortly after applying. Oddly enough others asked what I was wearing and told me it was very pleasant.Applying this deodorant was fairly easy. With other stick deodorants it feels like you\'re rubbing a rock under your arm, uncomfortable. This was unlike others and applied smoothly.The big minus:Kind of uncomfortable. While application is pretty smooth actually wearing it is not. After wearing it for a couple of hours it begins to, for lack of a better word, chafe. The downfall of stick deodorant begins to shine through. As the moisture of the deodorant begins to disappear you are left with a powdery irritating feeling.The Rundown:I work in an office and don\'t really find myself in the situations where I\'m sweating profusely. Because of this the anti-perspiration factor is, to me, not needed. A product that is strictly deodorant tends to work best.I\'ll be sticking to my Old Spice Red Zone. However, if your job requires you to work in high heat, or you work out often this deodorant will work best in those conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.  Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave.  However, both razors seemed to give the same shave in terms of closeness.  To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days and there was no appreciable difference.I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.  The battery power works in the shower, so that\'s a nice convenience.  Naturally, with a battery, there\'s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3.  Since my old razor never bothered me, I won\'t be switching to these more expensive blades.

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

That\'s how safe the safety razor has become.  I\'ve not nicked myself in over a year of use. The blade it came with lasted 3 months - but, as with previous models, the replacement blades are apparently made of less stern stuff.The wider spacing of the blades is vast improvement over previous models. Finally, you do not need torrential water pressure to clean your razor.  Actually, cleaning the Fushion reveals its best feature.  Under the flow of tap water, with the motor on, it sounds much like a mini didgeridoo, the Austrailian aboriginal instrument. I don\'t know if this was by design, but, if you\'re a world music fan, it\'s a delightful addition to your day. This is probably why they called it Fusion.

First the lubricant strip is much larger than the earlier Gillette razor blades had, and the five blades actually seem to help avoid razor burn and cuts. Also the power button has been moved making accidental power on and offs a thing of the past. The razor honestly does a great job on the first shave, making going back over tough areas less likely, particularly right out of the shower.I know that most men have their favorite shaving products. But Gillette\'s razors and shaving gel are favorite, and in my opinion their system just provides a superior clean and comfortable shaving experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

1709,610,20061024,B000BUUVTY,5,"October 24, 2006",A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,Best shaver I\'ve ever had.,"I\'m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they didn\'t even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs.

I\'ve also got the Gillette Fusion 5-blade shaver, and I definitely prefer 3 blades, especially for travel.  Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2327,1239,20090428,B0013MTHWQ,5,"April 28, 2009",A1C054192QS1QJ,Smoothest Shave for a Man,"I\'m a man.  I admit it: I shave my face with a woman\'s razor.  My friends laugh, but it makes total sense.  Which razor would provide a smoother shave - a product marketed towards women, or one marketed towards men?Women know comfort.  They know how to get a smooth shave.  They know these subjects way better than men.So I\'ll get the last laugh as my guy friends who are too insecure to shave with Venus Embrace, get nicks and razor burn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2064,973,20080402,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 2, 2008",A2V4P6IRCK1P70,Shaving for Dummies - in a good way,"I\'m giving this razor a 4 out of 5 stars because it gives a close shave, but not the closest. It\'s not as effective as previous Venus style blades. The good part is it\'s nearly impossible to cut yourself with this head. It is so wide, and the blades so recessed, that they don\'t really scrape the skin the way you expect. For those used to using the larger Venus blades, this will take only a little adjustment, because it\'s a little wider than the earlier models. For those used to normal shaving heads, this will seem odd and will take quite a bit of adjustment. I don\'t know about using it on more delicate spots - I don\'t think I\'d try.The blades are spaced so that they are surprisingly easy to rinse and they don\'t clog. The handle is probably the best Venus has produced so far. The shower pod is ok - the suction cups actually stick to the wall as they should and it holds a couple of spare blades.If you have trouble with nicks, or if you have boney areas around your knees or ankles, I think you\'ll like this set-up. For my part, it\'s ok, but I\'ll be sticking with the previous Venus blades, which are the best available, and give a closer shave. I might nick myself once in a while when I wouldn\'t with this one, but it\'s worth it to me to get the closer shave. Someone with more sensitive skin might prefer this model, and the moisturizing strips are just right - not too \'gloppy\' but still improving the \'glide\' factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4223,1605,20090522,B001JQLNFA,5,"May 22, 2009",ACK880145VWRV,An Excellent Product,"I enjoyed pilot-testing this razor.  It has little \'wings\' of soap on either side of the triple blades that flex to fit the contours of the body.  Its \'white tea\' fragrance is pleasing but mild, and I think it would pass muster with most sensitive noses.  The grip is comfortable even in my nondominant hand, and the light pink color is very subtle--not too girlie.  About the only minor gripe that I had with the Sea Breeze is that it comes with a bulky holding case that can be mounted on the wall of a shower.  The case is intended to store the razor and a couple of blade-and-soap cartridges, but it was not too esthetic so I just didn\'t install it.  Otherwise,this item deserves a high recommendation.  (Oh, and did I mention that it gives a great shave?)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course, I also hated the 5 o\'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It\'s worth the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2035,942,20080411,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 11, 2008",A3L1MEXXDI4Q77,"Nothing Special, But Perfectly Good","The Gillette Venus Embrace Razor, with five blades, doesn\'t shave noticeably closer than previous Venus models. I happened to have a Venus Vibrance (which has three blades) in my shower, so I tried the Embrace on one leg and the Vibrance on the other. (I did not turn on the vibration on the Vibrance, because I have never found it to make any difference and because I felt it might skew the experiment.) I put a new blade on the Vibrance, so that both razors were starting out on as level a playing field as possible.There was very little noticeable difference in performance. Both razors shaved my legs smoothly. The only drawback to the Embrace is that it has a slightly larger head, which makes it a little difficult to maneuver around knees and other tricky areas. I saw no difference in closeness of shave between the three and the five-bladed razors; and a few days later, I saw no difference in the amount of stubble.Overall, I\'d say that if you are a first-time Venus buyer, the Embrace is a fine choice; but if you already have a Venus razor, the Embrace really isn\'t an upgrade, and there\'s no reason to buy it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6188,2497,20090926,B004B8AZH0,4,"September 26, 2009",AWPODHOB4GFWL,Gillette Raises It\'s Own Bar!,"I have used the Gillette Mach3 Shaving System, 1 system for several years and found the closeness to be excellent with one blade lasting three weeks. It costs about $9. The Gillette Mach3 Cartridges , 8 cartridges cost about $10. Now I\'ve tried this Gillette Fusion Power razor at a cost of about $12 with Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges, 8-Count Package costing about $20.For the extra $3 for the razor, it cannot be beat. Gillette has raised its own bar for excellent shaving. This razor has five blades instead of three, guaranteeing the closest possible shave with several cool features. The blue lubricating strip turns white when the blade reaches the end of its use. It comes with a AAA battery that fits in the ergonomically slip-free grip handle (with a low battery light indicator). This vibrates the five blades at a high rate to ensure a very close shave. The microchip in the handle turns the razor off after eight minutes. Plus, on the back side there is a `precision trimmer\' blade that cuts those sideburns exact and is gentle enough to trim around your moustache, goatee and nose. Gillette claims each disposable blade will last up to a month, but I have found Gillette blades (the three blade version) to last three weeks. So I expect this five blade version to last well past a month. That\'s amazing.The Gillette Fusion handle costs $3 more and the refills (8) cost $10 more, but they last longer and the shave is so much closer. Spend the few extra dollars and get a razor with blades that last longer than any other on the market. I suggest buying in bulk to save money. You do get what you pay for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gillette keeps inrocuding newer, more expensive razors.  The latest, Proglide Fusion has been so heavily disocunted that I deided to give it a try.  It is a perfectly fine razor once you get used to maneuvering the rather large head in tight spaces, like around your nose.For the first couple days, I shaved half my face with the old and the other half with the new and really couldn\'t see/feel much of a difference.  I continued to use the new one for about 3 weeks and then went back to the SENSOR.  It shaves every bit a well as the newer one and for about one third the cost for the new blades.  I rue the day when they stop making these blades.  This seems to be in the planning stages as they are now encouraging people to not buy MACH3 and switch to Proglide.

The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months....

I also like the moisturizer around the blades, but you do still need to use shaving cream.One bad thing about the moisturizer is that it makes it harder to travel with it.  The moisturizer strip gets gooey and messy unless you\'ve let it COMPLETELY dry.  I end up keeping it in it\'s own zip lock baggy while I\'m traveling to avoid getting all my toiletries gummed up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
217,225,20090316,B0001LQGEM,3,"March 16, 2009",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,Average performance,"After using this razor for a short period of time, I feel compelled to tell others how it stacks up in the world of razors. With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one. The cartridges are still available in some stores, however. This review specifically covers the Sensor3 cartridge system.Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor3. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Sensor3 cartridges are noticeably smaller than the Mach 3 cartridges, by comparison. The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.The shave: 3 stars. I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving. I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days\' facial hair growth. The angle of the blade takes some getting used to. I noticed several times that I placed the blade on my face at the wrong angle, presumably because of my adjustment to the Mach 3/Fusion/Quattro razors which seem to have a more linear handle design. The biggest problem I encountered were several cuts. Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors. I do note that the shave was close, but comfort was lacking.Durability: 3 stars. This is the durability rating I give to the Sensor3 disposables. I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges. Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.Overall: The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable). For razor systems, one would be advised to choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought it on amazon and used it in NJ. Here is my take on this Razor:1. The handle grip is awesome, very confortable.2. The blades, where are they ? does it have blades? Which means i dont feel like there is a blade, they are so thin, its really glides on my face.3. Vibrations, they are soooo soothing, i think i would recommend a buy not without it, it doubles the gliding pleasure. Dont buy the manual one (my very personal opinion, you can if you want :-) )4. The shave is so close, even if you shave against the grain, it works like WOWWWW.5. My skin is little extra sensitive, so i do get razor bumps near my throat, but i dont think thats because of the razor, i get in all Razors or electronic shavers (i have Norelco Speed XL).6. I use it with art of shaving kit. Its the best partner.7. I also feel those who shave there pubic areas, this blade will be a extra plus because of extra thin blades and very little space between each blade, less chances of cuts. (i have not tried it though ;-)).The best deal is when you buy it with the extra Cartridges.The shipping was prompt and on time.Overall i am impressed, give me some more stars to add :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I have always been somewhat unsatisfied with the natural products I\'ve tried, because I ended up with a good deal of nicks and razor-burn.  A few months ago a friend stayed with me and after trying my shaving cream he went to the store to \'get some real shaving cream\'.  He bought a can of this Gillette Ultra Sensitive Fusion Hydra Gel, claiming that it\'s the best.  He left it at my house, and eventually I tried it.  I was amazed at how much better it is that all the other stuff I tried.  After I used up that can, I bought this 6-pack from Amazon.  I gave a can to my roommate who shaves his head, and he said that it\'s the best shaving cream for head-shaving.I generally prefer to use products on my face/body whose ingredients I can recognize and understand, but this shaving cream is so superior that I make an exception.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

493,503,20110703,B000BUUVTE,4,"July 3, 2011",A1IIUCG9TJFUWS,Wish I\'d Bought One Sooner:,"When I first heard that somebody was actually selling a 5-blade VIBRATING razor, I thought I\'d never EVER try it. It sounded like a perfectly good way to turn my face into a pepperoni pizza with extra EVERYTHING on it. The truth, however, is that this is a FANTASTIC product, and I now wish that I\'d bought one MUCH sooner.Random thoughts (since so much has already been said in the Amazon reviews here):1. I HATE shaving. I just frigging HATE it. I can never quite seem to get it just right, and I generally do end-up looking like something straight out of a Stephen King novel when I\'m done. THIS razor has actually changed that for me; I have yet to cut myself with this thing -- believe me when I tell you that (for me) that is really saying something -- and I honestly think that you\'d have to TRY to draw blood with this thing in order to do so.2. Thirty (plus) Dollars for a dozen replacement blades is absurd. (I do pay it, though. Because the shave IS that good.)3. The originally installed blade (usually) in products like these is a high-quality (pharmaceutical grade) titanium (this is true for almost everything sold in this retail space, by the way), and is designed to give you a fantastic first impression -- which it does. The originally installed (set of) blade(s) is an incredibly sharp, long-lasting set -- a finely-tuned, well-engineered piece of highly-toleranced machining that is designed to keep you coming back for more -- which means: buying replacement blades, and a LOT of them. That first, originally-installed set of blades is created to IMPRESS, and the real test of a concept (such as vibrating blades) really needs to be taken past the first usage, and deep into the experience of using replacement blades. I\'ve been using this for about a year, now... and the product continues to impress.4. Replacement blades, of course, are quite different than the originally installed blade -- but there is a simple method to make your replacement blades last much longer than they do, and it\'s this: spray some shower cleaner on the blades, and hang the razor upside down, so any moisture can drain away. The alcohol within the shower cleaner will pull the water away from the blades, and will keep it away. This will prevent the conditions that create rust on the actual blade(s) -- and without that chance to rust, your blades will last for weeks EACH.5. Shaving with a vibrating razor takes a bit of getting used to: you don\'t \'pull,\' but instead, you sort of let it \'drift.\' That\'s not exactly correct, but it\'s close enough. All you really need to do is to exert enough pressure to indicate the general direction of the stroke, and let the razor DRIFT at its own speed. You don\'t \'pull,\' and you don\'t force it. You let it drift.6. Use a good shaving gel, set-up a fogless mirror in the shower, and this thing will give you some incredibly close shaves as you stand under hot water. Take care of your blades with a bit of alcohol-based shower cleaner, hang the unit upside down so water can drain away, and this actually is a worthy investment -- even if they do charge $30 for a set of replacement blades.4 stars.Thirty Dollars for 12 replacement blades is NUTS.That\'s not even debatable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The razors are pretty good, perhaps the best Venus ones there are. They give a pretty close shave, but I wish the moisture strip was a bit bigger or more well, moisturizing. Still, you can\'t beat the price and they work pretty well. I would recommend them to anyone, but if you have dry legs I\'d suggest getting a moisturizing shaving cream and lotion for after you\'re down shaving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first day I grabbed the Fusion ProGlide with my hand I noticed a big difference in the handle. Just like everyone is saying you definitely feel a much more better grip in your hands. I was impressed when Gillette came out with the Fusion razor thinking wow this is the razor I will use forever, but when they came out with the Fusion ProGlide I was blown away. To this date I am STILL using the FIRST blade that came with the razor..... Yeah you heard right the FIRST BLADE. I bought it about 2 months ago and each time I shave it feels so good. No more irritations, no more having to feel that your beard is getting pulled, no more razor bumps at least for me. Once my beard grew back I shaved with my old razor the Gillette Fusion don\'t get me wrong it\'s a great product but after 4 to 5 times one shaves I started to notice all of the above I have mentioned. Especially the redness after I shaved half of my face. I switched to the Fusion ProGlide to finish the other half of my face and let me tell you it was the best feeling ever on my face it truly does glide. Like a hot knife cutting through a stick of butter. I use to hate shaving but with this new product from Gillette I enjoy shaving once again and most importantly this will save me a lot of money when buying the blades. They will last longer trust me on that. I recommend this Fusion ProGlide to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After Using these over a few months my arm pits became infected. When I saw the doctor and he asked about deodorants, it was apparent to him what had caused my pits to become infected. It was basically because the antiperspirant does not let your pits sweat at all, that they are basically blocking your the sweat glands which can lead to an infection.It may be different for, but for me I sweat easily despite being skinny, and non clinical strength ones do not work as well/barely for sweating. So use at your own risk/are not as often as you would with normal onces, I would advise everyone, from personal experience to not use these at all.

The head of the razer on the fusion is larger than the mach 3. Blade on the fusion not interchangable like the mach 3, mach turbo, m3 turbo, mach nitro.

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn\'t have to go in a store to get them. I\'m not what one would call hairy so I\'m easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don\'t then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest \'Shaving Tips From Gillette\'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve resisted the temptation to purchase Gillette\'s \'shaver of the moment\' because I was satisfied with what I had.  The other day I went to a big-box store (sorry, Amazon)to buy more blades and saw this product.  I bought it, and just tried it for the first time.  IT IS AMAZING!  I had a 2-3 day stubble- always problematic, especially above the chin and the upper lip- and it cut through that like butter.  Contrary to what a few of the other reviewers said, I feel that the vibration materially improves the feel of the shave- I turned it off and felt quite a difference.  Sure, the blades are a little more expensive, but what\'s it worth to make a chore that men do daily (well, at least most men do most days) this much more pleasant?

Well, I don\'t remember the name of the type I was using just prior to this - it has, I think, 4 blades and a waxy-looking purple strip of \'moisturizer\' above and below the blades section - but this new one, the Venus Embrace, doesn\'t do any better or worse a job than the previous types of blade.  I have always liked the Venus blades and I\'ll keep buying whichever type is available at the store, but if you\'re happy with your old Venus there\'s really no reason to change to this one.  Oh, it does come with a little suction cup thing to mount it on the wall of the shower or next to the tub - that\'s kind of nice.All in all, does a great job, just like I\'ve come to expect from Venus and Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

47,50,20080313,B000052YHS,2,"March 13, 2008",A2QMXIFIVE4LNS,The best expensive mediocre shave a man can get.,"Mediocre and Overpriced, March 13, 2008By  supernatural (Illinois) - See all my reviewsUnfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems. It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I shave every day, and it just got to be too much. I switched over to the Soleil - small, disposable and easy to maneuver. When I saw this 5 blade Venus up for review, I thought I\'d take a chance.It does give a nice smooth shave. Is it significantly better than 4 blades? Not that I can tell.The head is HUGE - between the 5 blades, the moisture strips and the rubber \'comfort\' areas, it\'s a pretty massive beast, especially compared to the Soleil. This was a downside for me, as I felt that I couldn\'t necessarily see where it was going - especially in the bikini and knee areas.The rubber gripped handle is very comfy.Overall, it\'s just not my thing, though it\'s not a bad razor. If you use and like the 4 blade version, which is a comparable size, you would probably also like this.

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

After a few times of shaving I suddenly find a few places on my beard (a few square centimeters area each) does not grow hair anymore (even after 2 months).As a result I cannot keep my beard even one day anymore (because the hairless points seem extremely ugly). It has totally ruined my face.This is my 3rd bad experience with Gillette in 6 months. Previously I obtained a Fusion and I found razors only work for around 12 shaves (while I used to use Mach 3s for a few months years ago).Also I obtained a shaving foam and the bottom of the canister was totally stained after a few weeks ruining the place I have put it (in front of basin).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This razor, however, is truly a giant step forward - I feel like Gillette is in the unfortunate position of having to market this as a slight improvement on a stock Fusion rather than a new line altogether, despite the fact that it is really leaps and bounds ahead of the older model.The razor glides over my face with no catching, no scraping feeling, and no irritation, all while delivering an incredibly close shave. I truly don\'t see how Gillette will be able to improve on this.(I promise I\'m not a paid employee of Gillette, I just think this product is really outstanding).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I put off buying the mach 3 for some time, because it is a bit pricer. But let me tell you what. I wish I would have got one A LOT SOONER!! The price differance is not much worse, if you buy the new razors online at Amazon. The handle on this thing has much more style, and is a lot more attractive than the sensor 3 and really has a nice precise feel, in your hand. It shaves incredibly close, and does an excellent job, going againest the grain! You look forward to shaving, which is something that never happened before. And you feel like a million bucks when you are done! I have already ordered a champion one with the red and black color scheme, because I\'m a Chicago Bulls fan. My opinion, this is prabably the best bang for buck on the market. The other systems with more blades and even fancier designs are WAY to expensive, unless you are just looking to toss money away!

The one thing about this product that I found a little different is that I really couldn\'t smell any fragrance with it, so it was hard to even tell if I had it on, one time I forgot if I put it on and I had no way of telling so I had to reapply.  I also had one or two days that I was using this where I still smelled a little bit sweaty by the end of the day, but I think that would happen with just about anything.  Some deodorants cause me to get a red itchy rash and this one did not, so that\'s a plus.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a virtually fragrance free way to reduce odor and sweat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These latest ProGlide cartridges are excellent, but they do have a major downside: they don\'t last as long as previous Fusion blades. However, they are sharper, causing less discomfort. Also just like the old Fusion blades, you have to be really absent minded to get a nick. I\'d say on average I get about 4-10 shaves out of them before I become frustrated and throw them away. That compares to about 6-15 with the old blades. I think they\'re worth it though, because they are simply the nicest, easiest, most comfortable way to shave. Far prefer them to fancy electric razors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

2159,1068,20080417,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 17, 2008",A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,WOW!!!!!,"I have been using the same type men\'s multi-blade disposable razor for a really long time and I thought I was pleased and happy with the product.  Then I tried the Venus Embrace Razor.  I will never go back to my original razor choice again.First thing I noticed was how the Venus 5-blade razor with its ribbon of moisture \'zipped\' across my skin and removed all the hair smoothly, easily, quickly, and completely on the first stroke every time.  I had not even realized the \'drag\' I was experiencing with my original razor choice until I felt how smoothly the Venus razor did its work. I had just shaved my legs the previous day, but my razor had \'given out\' just before completing my shave and one leg had not gotten a smooth shave.  Trying Venus Embrace the next day, not only did I get an immediate and smooth shave on the \'unfinished\' leg, but on reshaving the \'completely shaved\' leg, I found that that I actually had not gotten a really thorough shave on it the day before either.I have always resisted those shaped, fat-handled razors because they look bulky.  My regular razor was thin and straight-handeled.  Now I see what all the hype is about.  The handle is comfortable, fits perfectly into the hand, is soft to the touch, and is wonderfully positioned.  It just feels \'good\' in my hand.  Actually it feels \'great\'.No \'suctioned-cupped\' item has ever seemed to work for me.  If they stuck at all, they were generally on the floor the next day.  Therefore I originally didn\'t intend to even try the showerpod.  After reconsidering how helpful it would be to have all my shaving utensils available inside the tub/shower area, I positioned it where I thought it would be handy if it would stick and affixed the suction cups.  Voila, it not only stuck, it is still there weeks later, never having come \'unstuck\' even once.While I regret my stubborness to give the newer-styled ladies razors a chance; I am completely sold on this Venus Embrance razor and anticipate it will be a long time before I think about changing razor brands again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was far and away much better, much smoother shaving and less painful than this razor.I have tried this razor using gel, foam and shaving in the shower.  Nothing can redeem it.

The Gillette Venus Embrace has a \'protective ribbon of moisture for a smooth glide\' but that\'s not to mean you can try this on your bare legs without moisturising them first.  Trust me.

121,126,20110906,B00005AUIE,3,"September 6, 2011",A4YG26XYCO726,Not as great as Venus Embrace,"I bought the Venus Embrace razor (the one with 5 blades) and LOVED it. I assumed it was the Venus razors (versus the Schick ones I had been using) that had made the difference, but the real difference turned out to be the number of blades. Going from a 5-blade razor to a 3-blade razor sucked! Though these ones are much, much less expensive, I find myself having to almost shave twice, going over spots the razor missed. Even after my shower I found spots the razor missed. I never had to worry about that with the Embrace.Also, I feel like the blades dull quicker. With the Embrace, I only had to change the blade about every month or so (shaving about 2-3x week) but this cartridge dulls much quicker than that.However, it is nice that any Venus blade fits all styles of razor handles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

4429,1818,20100601,B003983HRI,3,"June 1, 2010",AORCXT2CLTQFR,The Gillette Fusion line\'s latest incarnation.,"When the original (manual) Fusion shaving system was introduced in 2005, it was truly a major improvement over any and all previously available razors. It was (and still is) a truly revolutionary, advanced and innovative shaving system that made shaving virtually painless and hastle-free even for men with tough beards and/or sensitive skin. The ProGlide is the latest incarnation of the Fusion and it does offer some advantages over the original Fusion but not nearly enough to justify switching over (especially when considering that the replacement cartridges will be even more expensive than the manual Fusion\'s!). When I shaved my head with the ProGlide, I honestly noticed NO difference whatsoever (neither better nor worse) than when I shave with the manual Fusion. When shaving my face, I did notice that the ProGlide DID do a slightly better job than the manual Fusion at shaving tricky and hard-to-reach areas (especially the moustache area just below the nostrils and around my Adam\'s apple) but this is probably because the ProGlide\'s cartridges are supposedly 15% thinner than the Fusion\'s. I should also point out that the ProGlide\'s handle feels more sturdy and offers a (somewhat) tighter grip than the (manual or Power) Fusion\'s and that the design is more elegant but (of course) beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The Bottom Line: Fusion ProGlide offers some minor improvements over the manual Fusion but nowherenear enough to justify upgrading to an even more expensive product when an already excellent one is available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

5887,2193,20101011,B003987CL0,4,"October 11, 2010",A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,Great--as expected--but way too expensive for me,"I have been a longtime fan of Gillette, having used their razors for easily 95% of my shaving life. I have tried--and rejected--several different Schick razors over the years simply because they were uncomfortable and left me feeling as though I had just shaved with broken glass using battery acid for shaving cream. I always went back to my Mach 3, then Fusion and was pleasantly surprised to see that the Fusion was being re-tooled to be even better.No matter HOW great my shaves have been using Gillette products, invariably I wince each & every time I go into a store to purchase replacement blades. Damn, but they\'re expensive! For some stupid reason, the times when I need a new razor the most seem to be at the moments when I can afford it the least. Weird, but a painful & expensive fact nevertheless.I swore off using Schick products shortly after the release of the Quattro model several years ago. I borrowed my brother-in-law\'s once and on a brand new blade, got a MUCH worse shave than I did using my 1 month old--not to mention rather dull and oft-used Gillette Mach 3 razor. After that I simply gave up even considering purchasing Schick products EVER again. I have always stuck with Gillette since--however, in all fairness I have discovered a 6 bladed razor that I have only found at Walgreens which shaves JUST AS GOOD as my Fusion--not to mention are cheaper (by at least $3 per refill), and would often stick with that in the last year or so when money has been tight.I finally saved up and purchased a Proglide razor recently and found the shave to be pretty much as expected. But as I began to take stock in all the models I have used over the years, I found something interesting...and I went and tested my theory to see if I was imagining it all--and nope, I was right on the money. The simple fact of the matter is this: all things considered, the Mach 3 razor shaves I would say about 98% as close as the Fusion 5 blade razor...and I aslo discovered that the Proglide does not shave ANY closer than the original Fusion. NONE. Considering how freakin\' expensive Gillette products are, and especially how much more they charge for the Proglide than the Fusion, I\'m sorry, but I would expect if the product cost 35% MORE, that the razor would actually perform 35% better, too. Not so. And when I factor in that the much cheaper Mach 3 shaves essentially as close as the other two MUCH more expensive razors, well I think you can figure out where I am going with this...I also discovered quite by accident, that Consumer Reports did their own independant testing and came up with the EXACT SAME results. Interesting, huh?I have one additional thing to add: through the amazon Vine program I received a Schick Hydro 5 razor back in early August. I only ordered it because I figured as long as I would be getting it for free, then at least if I did not like it, I could throw it away and not feel as though I had wasted any money. I was exceptionally surprised when after my first shave I had decided that I would go out and purchase a replacement cartridge right away. Yes, it was THAT good. From what I have noticed having used it now for over 2 months (still on the first original blade, too) is that the Hydro blades stay sharper MUCH longer than ANY previous Gillette product I have used in the past. Imagine my surprise when I went to purchase a replacement 4pack cartridge and discovered it was just under $5 cheaper than the regular Fusion 4pack and nearly $7 cheaper than the Proglides. In fact, it was about the exact same price as what I was paying for Mach 3 cartridges some 5 YEARS ago. Cheaper razors that last longer and still give me a top notch razor-burn-free shave adds up to one very converted former Gillette fanboy.To sum it up: did the Proglide shave great? YES. In fact it was a superior shave all around. Would I recommend buying one? Well, that depends. Personally I doubt I\'ll pay for another Proglide razor ever again. I simply cannot justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper. Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...but I found that for ME, the opposite was true. While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process. Either way, if you have the money, buy what works for YOU and don\'t let anybody tell you different.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shave is the closest I have ever had and the quickest. The vibrations (really, they are tiny micro-vibrations) enable the razor to glide through my beard much quicker and with a much closer shave than I would normally have.This is the best razor I have ever used in more than 25 years of shaving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

1832,735,20060209,B000BUW8WM,5,"February 9, 2006",A25PR5URUY4LFZ,The BEST a man can get (right now)!,"As an M3Power owner, I was unsure of whether or not to make the purchase for the Fusion, as I am sure most people are. When I bought the M3Power, I assumed that I would never feel the urge to buy another razor because it had 3 blades (seemed like plenty) and had the power component, so what else was there?But then I started hearing about the Fusion and I read these Amazon reviews, and I decided to take the plunge and give it a shot (oh how I miss the days when they used to send the Mach3 free in the mail!). Costco has a nice deal where it is $18 for the Fusion Power with 4 blades (and handle) so I should be set for some time. I used each M3Power blade for at least a couple months without incident so the same should be true for the Fusion. I remember when the Mach3 first came out and it was recommended to change the blade every 3 months, but now because of that Aloe strip, they only last 3 uses? To me that is nonsense and wasteful as the blades themselves work just fine down the road and so do the microfins which IMHO work fine even if there is no more Aloe left!Anyway, I couldn\'t wait to have my first shave with the Fusion, and I couldn\'t believe how fast I was finished shaving my whole face! Because the blades are closer together, it felt as though I was shaving with barely even one blade, and I did not find that hairs got stuck between them which was my only concern with the design. With the power turned on, the razor went smoothly across my face, and I barely felt anything which is really what one wants when shaving. I personally don\'t like to go against the grain on my neck, but the Fusion did a decent job going with the grain so I was most pleased. The single blade on the back was nice for evening out sideburn hair and getting at those pesky under-nose hairs. Lastly I felt as though the pivot motion of the blade head was even more forgiving than the predecessors which made the transition between shaving my face and shaving my neck hair even smoother.The only gripes I have are its cost, but that\'s obviously a supply/demand issue, and its color which is orange and quite bright. I like the blue of the Manual Fusion better, but I like the power that I get from the Power Fusion, and since color is superficial, it is hardly a big point of concern. I just wonder if Gillette intended this color to displease people so they will be enticed when they come out with the Fusion \'Nitro\' or some other color scheme!Still this is the BEST razor on the market and worthy of a buy if you are like me and don\'t go through a razor head every week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

	5	""August 28, 2011",A3L9N4GC7C9E9,The best shave ever,"Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o\'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It\'s worth the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I called to company they stated that the average life is only 3 times.  That is one expensive blade! One that does not last long at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It actually shaves pretty well, though I must confess, I do use the gel and after shave. However I only shaved with the grain, because going against it, would usually leave me razor burn. Especially when I\'d forget to shave a day or 4. Also going with the grain you wouldn\'t get as smooth a feel as you would going against. Then, out of pure curiousity, I used, according to what the reviewers before me said, the seldom used single blade on the back, to go against the grain. Wahla! It gave me the smooth shave I wanted, and even when I\'d forgoe shaving for a couple days, I have yet to receive any razor burn. Give it a try, and that 2 star shave becomes a 4. By the way, I gave it a 4, becuase it just so damn expensive, buying the new cartridges, and shave gel. Yet here I am going to the store anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I contacted Proctor and Gamble about the counterfeits I received and here is their response.Richard,We appreciate your bringing this to our attention.  P&G doesn\'t distribute our products through Amazon.  If you have questions about the authenticity of the product you purchased, please contact Amazon.  In the meantime, I\'m sharing your message with our Security Team.The safest, most reliable way to purchase our products is through retail stores.  [...]Judging by the mixed reviews, some people may get real blades and some may not.  In any case, if you get fake ones you have to pay the postage to return them to get your refund so you will lose time and money if you come up with the counterfeits.  Also consider that you may get reasonably good counterfeits (though doubtful) which still isn\'t giving you the actual product\'s quality experience.  Because I had to return the blades to the reseller I was unable to send them to Proctor and Gamble for their security team to research.  All I\'m saying is, it\'s a gamble to save a few dollars.  I will never buy blades again from an online seller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Razor runs for 5 seconds with flashing light then stops.  Check battery - not down in power but swap for new one - razor runs for 5 seconds with flashing light then stops.  That\'s it - I now have an unpowered fusion with a thicker handle for several $ more.  I doubt I will spend the $ required for more cartridges I can buy a new mach3 and blades for the same price.This is a disposable razor masquerading as a real razor - I wondered why many stores here were not selling the cartridges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m glad the prescription strength products are finally hitting the market, because no one wants to go to the doctor to ask for a deodorant Rx.Anyway, you only apply this at night, so it is going to last a long time, and then the higher price doesn\'t seem too bad.  3 clicks of the product to each arm-pit.It is unscented, so if you wanted, you could always apply a deodorant after it dries, but make sure it is just deodorant and not another antiperspirant.I\'ve been using it about a week and have been very happy with it.  I have been doing a lot of yard work and thus working up quite the sweat.  So I will be in a full body sweat but my armpits are pretty dry.Even more importantly it keeps my shirts dry at work.

1834,737,20060208,B000BUW8WM,3,"February 8, 2006",A3RVXXEEDC6EQT,"Good shave, if used the right way","I must admit it was the Super Bowl XL commercial that enticed me to try this razor.  I\'d had a not-so-good experience with the Quattro, so I was a little wary when I discovered this one had even more blades.My experience with the Fusion: It does grab the stubble and take it off slightly better than the M3 Power, but ONLY shaving counter to the direction of the beard growth.  When I shave, I usually mix my strokes up and down, and found that this razor did not remove the beard as well as the M3 Power when shaving on the downstroke.  So I had to restroke my face on certain areas which remained rough after the initial shave, which actually added to my shaving time.  I can only assume the other reviewers who said shaving time was decreased, use only upstrokes when shaving.Second, I was very disappointed when the blue indicator strip disappeared completely right after the first shave.  Refill blades are more expensive than the M3 Power, which usually last me 2 or 3 shaves at least.The last con I have is that the battery button is a bit too sensitive and placed exactly where I like to hold the razor with a firm grip.  Twice while I was shaving I accidentally switched it off.Conclusion:  I would use the Fusion to shave only for special or formal occasions, because of the cost of replacement blades and the shaving style needed for optimum work outweigh the benefits of the slightly better shave I could get.For regular everyday shaving, I\'m sticking with the M3 Power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6484,2799,20120320,B0062IWQVU,4,"March 20, 2012",A39Q1ONUR4P4H0,Great for the price.,"I was looking forward in giving this trimmer a try, reading all the positive reviews just made it even more exciting. I purchased mine from Zellers, from all the places in Toronto, Ont. Zellers was the only store that had them in stock, I could only assume the other more popular places like, Walmart and Shoppers Drug Mart were all sold out.At that time I had a chin strap with messy stubble on my neck and cheeks. So it was a perfect time to fix up my style.So I started with the trimmer, I love the feeling of the product, despite how cheap it cost, it surly does NOT feel cheap. The combs are easy to clip on and off. I used a size 2 to trim my chin strap down and looked great. The only downside i found with the trimmer is the numerous times i had to run thru the hair to make sure i got everything, I still ended up missing a few. Also the width is quite narrow but nothing to disappointing. Then i removed the comb and used the trimmer to line up my chin strap to easily shave around it, but it doesnt seem to trim close enough to do a line up.I moved on to the razor, I shaved around my chin strap, i love how smooth it glides across my face, but the shave was not very close as the disposable razors i was using before this. I had to go over a few times, still had missed spots and even going over that, it leaves a layer of very short stubble, no matter how often i go over it. Mind you i went with the grain, not against it. UPDATE: i tried shaving again, this time i applied more pressure to the device which did end up shaving alot closer but caused a bit of irratation on my neck. Its also not as smooth as it was the first time around, not sure why.Then i used the precision edging blade to finish off my style, used it around my strap to give it a final line up, didnt seem like it was doing much aswell, I had to shave the area a few times to actually get the left over stubble from the razor. I\'m unsure if its the product or i was unfortunate to have picked up a faulty one with a dull razor :\. So i plan on buying a pack of cartridges and i\'ll give this another go.So over all i\'m giving this a 3/5 for now, i will edit and update the info untill i give it another shot.UPDATE: Gave this item a second shot, in all honesty i like the product just because it does what it says it does. Don\'t expect a powerful device, considering its powered by a single battery. But its exceptional for the price, small, easy to storage, nice look and feel. Easy to maneuver. Its worth giving a shot. Im sure since this product was such a success, with all the positive feedback ive read through out numerous sites, they\'ll try to create a much better one in the near future.. at least i hope they do, cuz i\'ll def. be looking out for that one.  end result 4/5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve used a lot of razor blade types over the years, and while the Mach3 Turbos are a substantial improvement over the Sensor line, I can\'t imagine razors improving significantly beyond this. I\'ve used the Fusions before and while they\'re great, I don\'t get the sense that that extra blade is really doing a lot.Some people seem to shave daily with no issues, but some of us aren\'t so lucky. That\'s where the Mach3 razors really shine - the shave is close, but gives the least amount of irritation of any razor I\'ve used. If you have problems with your razors leaving your face feeling raw, you can do all sorts of stuff (better shaving cream, soaking your face in hot water, etc.), but at the end of the day, it all comes down to your razor.

I find it slightly smoother and easier on my face than the original Fusion blades, though I still feel the pull and tug around my mouth and just under my chin as I did with the original Fusion blade.But maybe it\'s just me: I do NOT understand the point of a AAA battery to shove in the handle. All it succeeded in doing (very well, I might add) was to make my right hand go numb. NOT fun. I tried with the vibration on and off and detected no difference to the shave except the numbness of my hand.In any case, yes it\'s a better shave than its predecessor, the hair doesn\'t get trapped in the blades as easily either, - but no it\'s not worth the extra cost at this point.

It has a nice weight to it -- definitely doesn\'t feel cheap -- and is grippy to hold, though the razor has quite a bit of bulk to it when using the Fusion ProGlide attachment. Not something to stop me from using it, but it\'ll take a little adjustment over the \'finesse\' I had with a regular Fusion handle. The trimmer is really where this thing shines. The Braun-branded trimmer is quite powerful and is perfect for shaping up my facial hair. I use it for sideburns and to keep a unibrow at bay. Gets the job done very nicely. Nothing to plug in, it runs off a single battery and the included stand is very space-saving.If you\'re already a Fusion user, this is a nice upgrade. If not, consider it just for the trimmer.

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

When I\'m at home, I like to shave with something that feels like it\'s built to last. After all, you don\'t drive a Power Wheels toy to work. HOWEVER, sometimes the need arises for a disposable razor...and when that time comes, consider reaching for a Gillette Good News razor.Aesthetics: 3 stars. There certainly isn\'t anything to look at on this razor. Lately, many of the big names (Fusion, Quattro) have been marketed in special colors and designs. This is plain razor with a plastic blue handle. The end. Yet, in its understated styling, it still has good features for a cheap disposable: pivoting head (non-pivot style available), lubrastrip, good blade angle.The shave: 4 stars. Yep, this thing ranks right up there with the big boys. It is a close and very comfortable shave. If you\'ve got sensitive skin (like me), the Good News performs quite nicely. It\'s a close shave without ripping a layer of skin off. Cuts are highly unlikely (unless the blade is dull, of course). The lubrastrip provides a small level of glide, but a good shaving cream/gel is recommended with this razor.Durability: 3 stars. I\'ve had disposables that lasted just one shave, others that last a week or more. This one is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack with regard to durability. I typically get three shaves out of a Good News razor.Conclusion: Good shave, ideal for people with sensitive skin. They don\'t last long, but the upside is that they are among the lowest-priced disposables on the market. Recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2076,985,20080331,B000XVSNTQ,5,"March 31, 2008",A2VZP50FSYD6CO,Works Wonderfully,"The Venus Embrace Razor has several nice features. It comes with a \'shower pod\', which has suction cups so you can store the razor right in the shower. There is room inside the pod to store extra razor cartridges and the cartridges are individually sealed to stay clean and dry when stored in the shower. The razor itself has five blades and a soft grip handle that makes the razor pleasant to hold and use.I had some misgivings about trying the Venus Embrace razor because any time I\'ve used disposable razors in the past, I ended up with painful nicks and cuts all over the place. I was pleasantly surprised once I used the razor. The shave was so smooth that I actually thought it wasn\'t working until I checked the razor and my leg. The five blades do a great job of shaving. It did take a few attempts for the shower pod to stick on the shower wall, but once it did stick the razor fit neatly into the pod and it proved to be very handy. The blades face against the shower wall, so there\'s no fear of accidentally brushing against it and cutting yourself. The fact that there\'s room inside the pod for extra cartridges is terrific, in case you need to change the cartridges mid-shave. It is very easy to change the cartridges, which is a plus. However, the extra cartridges are not cheap, which is a minus.The Venus Embrace razor is one of the best razors that I\'ve ever used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

5831,2136,20111115,B003987CL0,5,"November 15, 2011",A35C1Y3Z0HWAU0,Baby Skin Smoothness,"I really believe the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor I have ever used. I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn. Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head. I have been shaving my head for 10 years and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head, I couldn\'t believe how baby skin soft my head felt. Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head. I shave my head once a day and sometimes twice. On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times. I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried. I have had no razor burn or cuts with this Power Proglide razor.  I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush. I can honestly say that there is not too much difference with using these shaving gels/soaps with the Gillette Power Proglide.The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin. I can usually get about 5 complete head shaves (several times with the grain and against the grain) and beard shaves  with one razor before I need to replace it. The trimmer is quite helpful to trim around and outline my beard, goatee, mustache and even the occasional eyebrow. The only negative for this razor is the price.If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can't be improved.  It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.

Well, she thinks that these razors are great, and now claims that she will not use any other razor. She finds that the razors work very well when she is taking a bath, and by storing it up high, she keeps the lotion bars from becoming soaked and getting ruined.That\'s right, I am not reviewing from personal experience, but when my daughter demands a product like she does this one, I know that it is good.

2413,1329,20090326,B001F51QJ8,4,"March 26, 2009",A10ZBR6O8S8OCY,don\'t sweat it,I like this product a lot.  It looks a little scary coming out the tube with its tiny beads but it goes on smoothly and you just have to make sure you rub it in your arm pit completely so it doesnt stain up your clothes.It is suggested that you apply the deodorant at night before you sleep and that makes it more effective since it works with your body to block the pores.  It says it works just as well even if you shower in the morning and do not reapply since it works over night to block pores.I haven\'t tried that since I shower every morning and would rather apply it before i walk out the door.  Its more a preference for me.I would say so far so good.  The big test will come in the summer when I have a long sleeve shirt on in the heat here in Philly.  I will update post then.I recommend the product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

31,32,20110818,B000052YHS,5,"August 18, 2011",A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,"Fast, effective, stupid-proof","The reason to buy this razor is so you won\'t have to think about shaving. There\'s no special technique, it\'s easy to clean, and it\'s disinclined to cut you. It doesn\'t feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I\'m using the same handle, and I\'ve since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can\'t feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don\'t reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won\'t fare as well. I\'ve bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.I\'ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it\'s difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it\'s been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge. Nitpicking, really.A safety razor would probably give you a closer cut, but if shaving is something you dispense with rather than an event to relish, the Mach 3 is where it\'s at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am one of those people that can go about a week in between shavings.  My hair on my legs doesn\'t grow fast and when it does it\'s not that coarse.  After using this razor several times the results were that I always felt or could see hair the next day or two days later.  That leads me to believe that with 5 blades, it\'s still not a close shave.I also felt the razor head was surrounded on all four sides with way too much plastic; making the shaving of more delicate areas, bikini line, etc, a little more challenging.  I felt I was doing some serious contorting in the shower this morning, and felt if I could have removed some of the bulky plastic, I would have been much better off.I did like the shower case that suctioned to the shower wall, I liked that a lot.  I also enjoyed the fact that I didn\'t have any razor burn or bumps.All in all I just don\'t think it\'s worth the hype.  The 5 blades didn\'t do anything more or extra that I could tell, and the surrounding plastic hindered anything the blades could have possibly done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

It did take some getting used to in the beginning figuring out the angle to get the best cut with the upper and lower moisturizing bars sticking out further than the blade, but now it\'s a \'breeze\'.  It\'s also nice that you don\'t have to worry about applying shaving cream to hard to reach places or that it will wash off - it\'s always on your razor!  As a busy mom with a one and three year old, I\'m not shaving every day, but I definitely found myself shaving more often because it took less time.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

6029,2337,20110913,B003EMVVMM,4,"September 13, 2011",ABHU2CJAYUPHW,Better than plain ol\' Fusion,"I always compare new blades to the old standard.First off - the Proglide blades WILL fit on the old Fusion handle.But, as one other reviewer pointed out, the new Fusion Proglide handle is better balanced.  I feel more comfortable with it when I\'m shaving in the shower.  It was worth the extra cost to me.When the original Fusion came out I compared to the Mach3, but couldn\'t tell much difference.  With a 2-day growth, I used a fresh Mach3 blade and a fresh Fusion blade, and they both pulled a little.  The only big improvement I could see was the top blade for under-nose trimming.Now, the Proglide is a different story.  I skipped a day shaving and did the same test.  The Mach3 pulled like pliers on my chin hair, but the Pro glided right through.  I think the thinner blades schtick is more than a marketing line.  At least for me it is.I\'d give it 5 stars, but it hasn\'t done anything magical like make me irresistible to the opposite sex :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have used a certain 5-blade mens\' razor for a couple of years, and I bought this on a whim because I wanted to try a more \'girly\' razor. This is better than a disposable razor, but not by much. I only gave it two stars because it didn\'t cut me like cheap razors would. I have to shave my legs TWICE in the shower because it misses so many hairs. I even put another cartridge on it because I thought I must have gotten a defective one. No. It just sucks. The head is HUGE, so forget about shaving any hard-to-reach places. As far as razors in this price range go, this is the worst one you can get. I will be throwing this out and going back to my trusty Gillette Fusion, which never leaves stubble. I don\'t mind having a manly-looking razor if it actually works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6508,2823,20120211,B0062IWQVU,5,"February 11, 2012",A34AJOQX9NGT7G,My Quick Take,There\'s a reason my local big box store can\'t keep these in stock. Buy on Amazon and save a few bucks. At this price you can\'t find a better quality trimmer let alone a razor as well. No cheapo plastic. It has a little weight to it and the rubberized grip feels great in your hand. The snap on combs aren\'t made of brittle plastic and have a bit of flex. The base that holds it all is well designed to actually hold everything securely. The trimmer works well and didn\'t pull any hairs on my beard and the fusion razor is well... a fusion razor. We\'ll see how it stands the test of time. Finally a trimmer that won\'t sit on the shelf. Well worth the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is difficult to open and press button does not work better. One more change which can be done in future models is keep distance between the detachable arrow and power button. I have average size hands but still it troubles while opening the adapter, power button switches on. As Per shave goes, it is the best product in the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

481,491,20060206,B000BUUVTE,4,"February 6, 2006",A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,Nice Shave But I\'ll Stick With The M3 Power,"I have been using Gillette\'s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it\'s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette\'s other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought these and after getting them realize I have the Sensor Excel. The only difference that I can see is that the Excel has little rubber squgees obelow the 2 blades where this one does not.

Keeps biking hair cropped short but without the skin irritation of shaving completely using a razor or without the risk of using scissors! I\'m surprised how well it worked.

All you want to know is does it smell good, and does it control your sweating or at least keep it to a minimum? Well you don\'t have to worry about body odor. It has a nice, clean smell that is not overpowering. As for sweating, I live in AZ and we are already hitting 100+ degree weather and by around the afternoon I was sweating. So if you live in weather that barely hits 90 degrees, then you will probably be fine. The one bonus with this is that it does not stain your shirt which I find to be a major plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4424,1813,20100707,B003983HRI,5,"July 7, 2010",AADKC6XBOF68V,The best shave ever!,"As a reference, my facial hair is not very thick or troublesome, and I generally shave every other day.I had tried the Mach3 for the first time about 10 years ago and had stuck with it since then.  In my mind, I couldn\'t imagine a more comfortable shave than what I was already getting with my Mach3.  Yesterday, I was at the store to buy a new Mach3 because my old handle had worn down over the years, and I finally decided to give one of Gilette\'s newer razors a try.I ended up getting a manual Fusion Proglide, and I was absolutely thrilled during my first shave with it this morning.  It was by far the best shave I have ever experienced!  The Proglide is so smooth, it hardly felt like there were any blades on the thing as I ran it over my skin.  It felt so nice, I am looking forward to using it again tomorrow morning (instead of waiting my usual two days).Unfortunately, although the razor package that comes with the handle is not much more expensive than some of the older Gilette razors, the replacement blades are noticeably more expensive.  I generally use my blades longer than most, but if you tend to run through new blades pretty quickly, using the Proglide may end up getting costly.  Regardless, I am now hooked on this thing already and will be sticking to this product.  For me, it\'s definitely worth the increased price, because I can\'t imagine having a better shave than what I experienced this morning!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2097,1006,20080324,B000XVSNTQ,5,"March 24, 2008",AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,The Stradivarius of Shavers!,"Gillette\'s Venus Embrace is by far the best shaver I have ever tried, and it\'s amazing as its 5 tiny \'Curve-Hugging\' blades glide over your skin and give you an incredibly close shave while hardly feeling it; and yes, it does leave you with \'Dramatically Smooth Skin.\' This gizmo is smooth and lovely to handle as well, with its light as a feather frame, \'Soft Grip Handle,\'  and pretty mint green and aqua colors. There\'s a balance to it that makes shaving a pleasure and a hazard-free experience too! Yes, we\'ve come a long way, in how women\'s shavers are made. I still remember the one I used 40+ years ago. A clunky metal thing, with a knob that turned and opened the shaver so you could insert a double edged razor, and then you\'d proceed to mutilate yourself. Since then, we\'ve put a man on the moon, and with Venus, Gillette has made the perfect women\'s shaver!I also appreciate \'New Shower Pod,\' which has 2 suction cups that adhere to your shower tiles (or any flat surface) and not only cradles your shaver, but holds extra blade cartridges (2 cartridges come with the package) inside. It has a nifty \'space age\' design, just right for a Venusian. Gillette\'s Venus Embrace is the real deal, in a world full of hype. Try it, you\'ll like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I preordered this razor with the hopes it would be better than the original fusion. I am happy to say from my experience that it is to me. This razor has no pull on a three day old beard along with no nicks or cuts, this must be due to the thinner finer blades. This is why they call it the pro glide. The lubrication strip is a lot bigger than the original and the diffrence is slightly noticeable during the shave. There was no stubble left over with a second pass. I have never tried the fusion power due to I feel that it is sort of a gimmic with the vibration in ways that other power razors have cut me or tugged at the beard so I stick with the manual. So far i am very pleased with this razor and even ordered the blade refills already. I will never even look back at my old fusion now due to the upgraded comfort and longer lasting blades of proglide. One reviewer feels that this razor is not much of an upgrade from the original and to stick with the original fusion but I beg to differ strongly. The old fusion is nice but no where compares to the proglide. It is definately worth the almost $11 for the best shave I have found so far!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve never left home feeling that I got a raw deal on these things. I\'ve used them for some pretty important events in my life, most notably and most recently, my wedding. No one\'s ever approached me and said, \'Hey -- learn how to shave!\' and that means something. So as you can imagine, I\'ve been using these things ever since. It feels good to walk into a room and know that anyone who may be scrutizing your face won\'t see any \'pesky whiskers\'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I laughed when I heard Gillette was coming out with a razor with 5 blades but it didn\'t surprise me. This is the best shave I have ever had. The 5 blades glide across the face without friction or burn and the shave feels effortless.  The 6th single blade is gimmicky but good for what it is for...under the nose and sideburns.  I cringed when I saw the cost of replacement blades but buy your blades on EBAY and save lots of money. I bought 64 Gillette Fusion blades on Ebay for about $85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

43,46,20100619,B000052YHS,5,"June 19, 2010",A25UZ7MA72SMKM,Best I\'ve ever used,"With previous razors, it was not uncommon for me to suffer minor cuts while shaving. I have never once had a cut with this razor.Evidently the battery vibration system in concert with the three bladed razors works well. I also get the smoothest shave I\'ve ever been used to. Tip: Run the blade with the whiskers, then make another pass lightly \'against the grain\'. You\'ll wind up with completely smooth skin, no razor burn, and no cuts.The blades are pricey, but in my experience last longer than the blades I\'d used for decades before. When you beging to feel any pulling at all, they are ready to change. Under normal circumstances you won\'t feel this shave against your whiskers at all. You can use the blades for a while after you start to feel a pull ... it still does the job and will just feel like your old razor did.This razor and these blades give me the most comfortable shave above the lip that I\'ve ever experienced. I have a pretty bristly bit of whiskers there, and have experienced lifelong pain shaving that area. I do get a pull feel there even with this razor with new blades, but no pain, and a relatively easy pass to shave there. I do not use the \'against the grain\' tip there tho, LOL, just a second pass with the grain but with a bit of extra pressure to get it close.I\'ve used this razor for a few years now and am delighted. I haven\'t tried the newer Fusion, but feel no need to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

The Mach 3 was a revolutionary idea at the time. It gave me much better shaves than Norelco or those horrible BIC shavers. Now with the Gillette fusion, I get better shaves and a long lasting blade. I shave in the shower because the wet hair is easier to shave than dry hair. I also use the tip of keeping the blade in down so gravity draws everything away from the blades. A really great product and system from Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

With this product, you get extra power; but you have to sacrifice some comfort and convenience to seal the bargain.First, let\'s get the obvious part out of the way: this stuff does a fine job of keeping you dry. In that regard it works as well as any antiperspirant I\'ve tried. Like other \'clinical strength\' products, the directions tell you to apply before bed at night, and explain how the product works by plugging up your pores so the sweat can\'t get out. I can\'t say that sounds too healthy to me, but after using a whole package, I didn\'t get a rash of any kind.Now, the sacrifices: in general, your underarm areas are going to feel weird. They\'ll feel tacky or rubbery to the touch, as though they\'re coated in dried rubber cement, especially for the first few hours after you\'ve applied the product. This might not bother everybody, but I didn\'t like the sensation.Finally, the elaborate packaging has a fatal flaw. You turn a little knob three clicks at a time to meter out the right dosage. The knob gives  satisfying loud click, and the packaging is strong and opaque. There\'s no squeezing or fooling around. But one day, you\'ll turn it one or two clicks and it will simply stop: the product will be all gone, but there will have been no warning. There\'s  just no way to tell when you\'re about to run out; this could leave you in an awkward position on the day of that big presentation...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought this was it , but no, the fusion is bulky compared to the Mach 3 the razor on the back is not very sharp/strong and hard to clean it is smoother when u shave but thats about the only difference no closer than the mach 3 i still have to go against the grain to get a smooth close shave . I understand that not everyones face is the same but i have been unable to find a razor that will give me a close shave without going against the grain not even th 5 blade fusion. Cotaray to popular belief the closest and most comfortable shave i have been able to get is from an electric razor the Braun Actviator.So there u have it other than the new fancy look theres really not much difference or advantage over the Mach 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5597,1897,20100724,B003983HRI,3,"July 24, 2010",A2IL3E3X9XM9O5,Don\'t get it,"I don\'t really understand all the hype and excitement.  It doesn\'t shave any more closely and comfortably than my triple blade, which didn\'t give me a better shave than my old double blade, which didn\'t...well, you get the idea.  I remember my great uncle used a straight razor and honed the edge every day on a strop bolted to the side of the sink.  He would apply the foamy lather he mixed in a mug with a horsehair brush.  A splash of Clubman after shave completed the process.  It was a morning ritual that I doubt he would have given up ever.  He would have guffawed and rolled his eyes at me for falling for the notion that multiple blades are better than one.  He was a very smart man.  Also a very close shaved man.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6138,2446,20100714,B004B8AZH0,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6283,2593,20061223,B004B8AZH0,5,"December 23, 2006",A1J1QS7I60O018,I\'m impressed  +READ for a blade-extending TIP!,"I\'ve been very happy with the Mach III for the past few years --but then a Fusion razor and cartridge came in the mail and I figured I\'d give it a try.I\'m probably a good one to test razors... see my photograph--not only do I shave my face, (though I typically have a goatee), but I also shave my entire head as well.I\'ve been using the same Fusion blade now --daily on my face, and just about every third day on my head-- and despite some claims to the contrary, it\'s still going strong... after almost three weeks!!Why has my blade lasted this long, despite my pretty heavy usage? EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as \'Clean Shower\' or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.)Then I set the razor so it\'s standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I\'d also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I\'ve been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I\'ve nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I\'m very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.)Note to Gillette... Send me a lifetime supply of Fusion cartridges and I\'ll consider removing the blade-life extending tip from this review!  ;-)- Jonathan Sabin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2176,1085,20080414,B000XVSNTQ,5,"April 14, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,Great Razor,"I have thick hair which grows in rather quickly. I have tried probably most hair removal products on the market. This includes a huge number of razor types, hair removal gels, buffers, sanders, yankers, radio signal needles, and much more.I admit that when the first more-than-two razor blades came out, that my boyfriend and I thought of them as a silly gimmick. The only reason we tried one is that a friend of ours worked at Gillette and I wanted to give her some feedback on how they worked. We thought it would be a wash. We were quite surprised that it did actually provide a better shave.In a way, it makes sense. The whole reason to have multiple blades is that hair is not all orderly and in a line. The first blade might cut off some of the hairs, but some will just bend beneath it. That bending then creates tension for the second blade to be able to cut it.If you only needed two blades, then you could do a single pass with a two bladed razor and have it completely clear all hair in its path. Of course, that doesn\'t work - at least not for me! When I then tested out a three blade razor, it definitely cut more hair on the first pass. Also, because you now have more \'cutting power\', you don\'t need to press as hard.So does this logic move on to give blades? Again, I was a little skeptical. First, the ergonomics of this razor are just GREAT. I\'ve tried many, many types of razors over the years. They can be very slippery in the shower. This one has a super combination of shape and texture. It fits nicely in the hand, and stays there securely.I also really like the wall attachment that this tucks into. The attachment holds spare blades as well. It stays securely on our shower wall and is easy to put the razor in and out of.So how well does it work? I\'ve tried it with a variety of soaps and gels. It slides smoothly and with the five blades it cuts thick hair with just one draw, without much effort. The without much effort part is really key. It means you get far less cuts, because you are not pressing down into skin bumps or goosebumps. You don\'t get razor burn because the blades are not dragging hard along your skin, slicing off the top layer.I haven\'t had any problems using it on any part of me. Underarms, legs, ankles, you name it. I would most definitely rather have the five blades with its gentle cutting power vs a smaller version. Heck, smaller razors with two blades *do* exist. There\'s a reason I use this one instead. It simply works better.Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shave is closer than the M3, and much more comfortable; I\'d say 50% more comfortable. I am amazed at the quality of the shaving experience.However, I haven\'t lost my mind yet to pay almost 4 bucks a blade. I would if they lasted more than 2-3 shaves, but they don\'t. You can do the math, but $400/year for blades is more than I can stomach. I can well afford it, but somewhere you have to put a line in the sand and say, enough. This is ridiculous and Gillette is taking advantage of the marketplace. Right now, they clearly have the best product, and can charge whatever price they would like. The first alternative that arises, it\'s adios to Gillette for me.I\'ll stick with the Mach 3 for now because it\'s plenty good enough, and already way overpriced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1837,740,20060203,B000BUW8WM,3,"February 3, 2006",A32U73AM871FTF,Mediocre shave for your $3.50 razor cartridge...,"I have owned the Gillette Sensor Excel, Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, and Schick Quattro, among other lesser-known razors, and shaved with them all while being increasingly more disgruntled at how much a little piece of plastic and metal costs. While I was impressed with the Mach 3, and more so with the Mach 3 Turbo, when I switched to the Quattro, I knew that was the razor for me. Close shave, smooth glide, rarely any cuts at all even on my difficult-to-shave face. Recently when I went to the store, they were out of the 4-pack of Quattro blades, and so instead of buying an 8-pack, I decided to try this brand new razor from Gillette. I\'d never had a 5-blade razor before (let alone a battery-powered vibrating one) and so I decided to go all out, even though I was very disappointed to find that the cartridges cost $3.50 EACH.It comes in a nice easy-to-open clamshell package with a cheesy-looking but convenient holder that can either lay flat or stand vertically, which is what I prefer. It comes with a battery, which was very easy to install, and is touted as being shower-proof. I wouldn\'t know, because I don\'t shave in the shower.The vibration was not at all what I was expecting. I don\'t really know what I was expecting since this was my first powered razor, but when they say \'gentle micro-pulses\' I think of a soft intermittent buzz. Not so. This razor is strong, and it vibrates like a cell phone, constantly, insistently and very noticably. I was surprised by how strong the vibration was for a small appliance.I used my standard Gillette foam shave cream, and set to work trimming my face. The first thing I noticed is that I couldn\'t really feel the razor on my face as it vibrated and shaved my whiskers. The second thing I noticed is that I also couldn\'t feel when my face was clean-shaven while the razor was vibrating. I rely on the way the razor feels and sounds on my skin to know when I\'m done shaving a spot, and the vibration drowned out any noise or sensation or any other feedback I might have gotten from the razor. However, it didn\'t make that much of a difference, because I had to go over the same spots four or five times in order to make them clean-shaven. I\'m not sure what the 5th blade is doing, but I don\'t have to shave the same spots that many times with even an old blade on my Quattro. However, when I was done, the final result was a pretty good shave, with a few nicks here and there--the Fusion doesn\'t work well with bumps on the face when vibrating.I also used the single trimmer blade on my sideburns. It seems to work as advertised, and it is easy to use for accurate trimming of the sideburns. The problem, however, is that the single-blade end is no good for shaving a larger area such as your entire moustache, but the five-blade side is way too large for such a task. I found it very awkward to shave my moustache area with either end.Bottom line: I will be returning the Fusion and exchanging it for a set of replacement cartridges for my Quattro. It still outperforms the Fusion in spite of having one less blade in the area of comfort and shaving sensation, and the cartridges are $1.50 cheaper each. I may go back to the Fusion sometime, but if I did, it would be the manual version, never the vibrating version. This was my first and last experience with a battery-powered razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you hardly have any hair, you probably don\'t really need it.i have tried ***ALL*** the Venus collection and many others, so take it from a pro!!! i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far. First it covers a much larger area so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors. A few strokes and you\'re done. i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!! i read a reviewer\'s comment saying that Embrace is the same as a 1 blade razor. NO WAY!! this one doesn\'t even compare to the one with 3 blades!!it is so practical, you don\'t need to go over the same area more than once or twice. the smoothing \'bands\' (meant for exfoliation i suppose) seem to assist the shaving because they smoothe the area perfectly. i was TOTALLY IMPRESSED with this one. The head is very flexible so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts. i have a sensitive skin but it is hard to cut yourself with this one - unless you overdo it or if you have very little hair. You don\'t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).i read a review by a man who uses this razor, well i use men\'s foam! i DON\'T use the foaming gels made for women. they foam much less than men\'s products. i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target\'s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper prices.i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product. Venus Embrace, that is. i hate shaving, and this one definitely makes it less unpleasant for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2059,966,20080405,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 5, 2008",A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,Very comfortable razor and a cool storage system.,"The Venus Embrace Razor promises a \'smooth glide\' and they definitely did not oversell on that point.  I could not believe the difference between my regular disposable razor and this one in terms of how smooth the Embrace felt while shaving.  In fact, I couldn\'t tell if it was doing anything--which felt weird at first because, with my regular razor, I can clearly tell that it is.  Even stranger was that, while I couldn\'t FEEL that I was shaving with the Embrace, I had razor burn when I put on my deodorant after shaving, whereas I usually don\'t have any razor burn when using my regular razor.  It\'s very possible that I may have unconsciously pressed harder because I was used to feeling my other razor and that caused the burn, so this could be \'user error\' and not a product fault.  Once I am more accustomed to using it and have broken out of my old habits with my old razor, I will have a better idea of which it is.Design-wise, the gel-grip handle is great for good grip in the shower, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the \'pod\' that sticks on the shower wall and holds the razor and the extra blade cartridge.  However, once I took the razor out of the pod to shave, I couldn\'t quite figure out how to get it BACK into the pod.  There is only 1 way it fits and it took me a few tries to find it (it seems obvious, because you know it has to fit into the pod at the narrowest point of the handle but, even with that assumption, it still took a few tries).All in all, I was impressed with the Venus Embrace Razor.  I took off 1/2 star because, while I love concept of the pod, I thought it should be simpler to get the razor back into it without having to think about it, and I took off another 1/2 star because I got razor burn when I don\'t usually (but as noted, that may have been my fault).Edited several weeks (and numerous uses) later to add:1. Once I got used to using a lighter touch with this razor vs. my old one, the razor burn problem substantially lessened to the point where I am having little or no razor burn now.2.  Once I got it in my head that the razor always goes back in the pod with the blades facing IN (which make sense), I have found it much easier to get the razor back in the pod without fumbling around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Turbo is truly an improvement on both of them. Mach3 Turbo is the first blade that lets me comfortably shave against the grain, which is what I need to do to get a close shave. It\'ll still nick you, but not often. You\'ll still get a bit of irritation, but nothing a little aftershave won\'t fix.It\'s good, though, and in my opinion, it\'s the best safety razor on the market.

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

I used to use a regular razor with shaving cream, but I always thought it was a pain. I would lift my leg up onto the built in shower seat but the water would wash away the shaving cream every time. Then my friend got me hooked onto The Venus Breeze built in soap razor. Now, shaving my legs is literally a breeze!!! It\'s a lot easier to do in a time in need. I can even shave legs and underarms when I need too. Like before a trip to the beach in the summer or a school concert. I love the Venus Breeze and would highly recommend it to anyone else who thinks shaving cream is a pain!!!!lollipopluver",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I use mine extensively everyday and the razor stays good and sharp for weeks; my current one has been used for over a month and I don\'t get cut or stubby whatsoever (however, with everyday use, 2-3 weeks swould probably give best results.) All in all, I really cannot live without them. They are incomparable to other razors, even other five blades.

6446,2758,20110403,B004QE83VE,4,"April 3, 2011",A47D5C32VLQM2,No razor burn! But won\'t last long.,"I\'ve owned and used just about every model of Gillette Venus made throughout the years.  They\'re not perfect, but they\'re the best that I\'ve found.  When I saw this new Venus Pro Skin, I decided to give it a try because it\'s actually cheaper than buying a new pack of blades (less blades, so more per blade, but cheaper overall) and you get a new handle with it, which is always nice because the handles can get dirty over time.The box opened astonishingly easy.  No scissors required.  This handle is a little bit longer and has more of an angle to it than other handles in the Venus series.  I thought that was nice.  The see-through light blue color was very pretty too.  Compared to my old Venus, this razor looked sleek and shiny.  I become more skeptical when I examined the new razor heads, though. The razor is surrounded by two gel pads.  There\'s nothing backing them, no plastic holding them on.  They move easily up and down as you touch them.  I\'ve had experience with some of these in-head shaving gel products before and have found that they usually completely fall apart or all of the lotion/gel is gone in about two shaves, when of course the razors should last much longer than that.Using the razor I found that it felt very nice on my skin.  I could tell the gel was helping lubricate the skin, but it wasn\'t overly sudsy.  However large strings of gel kept coming off the razor.  This was a little bit gross.  Also the head was too large to fit into tight curves and made it really hard to shave certain spots.  As I expected, one shave used about half of the gel pad, which is a big disappointment.The big test for me is after I get out of the shower, though.  For the first time in ages I didn\'t have any nicks from shaving with a new blade!  I always dread switching blades because I always get cut up.  Also my legs didn\'t itch.  I frequently have trouble with razor burn and itching, and this product actually solved that for me when nothing else has.So where does that leave me?  This product worked wonders for protecting my skin when nothing else has.  I love it for that reason alone.  But the gel pad isn\'t going to last more than a few shaves, which would mean that I\'d have to buy a new head every few days.  That would be ridiculously expensive, but honestly maybe worth it considering how much I do suffer from razor burn normally.  I think if you have problems with razor burn, you should give this product a try.  If you\'re looking for a new handle for the Venus, this one is very pretty.  But if you\'re happy with your current shaving gel routine, these gel pads are bulky and won\'t last hardly any time at all.  For those people, I think this product is a waste of money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.

I have coarse facial hair and the last thing I want is five blades scrapping my face at the same time.

I won\'t even start on the price Gillette charges for this razor and its cartridges...I have tossed this razor and now use a \'old school\' safety razor, the razor that made Gillette a household name.  I get a much closer and more comfortable shave.  Gillette, now owned by Procter and Gamble, definitely isn\'t what it used to be.

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

331,340,20051223,B00024C160,4,"December 23, 2005",A2V60RB1FRH35C,"great shave, but costly...","I have an incredibly hard time shaving with just any blade. I will cut myself into a million pieces with the cheap disposable blades, and even previous versions of the mach 3 blade still left my skin irritated.  Now that the m3 power has come out, the shave is so much less irritating and, when combined with m3 power shave gel, it performs even better! The green lubrication strip is amazing! The blades just glide right over the skin with the new addition, however I typically find that the lubrication only lasts me 2 shaves, and then it starts to nick up my skin. The blades break down to about $1.00 a piece, which turns out to be $0.50 per shave for me (for the blade product alone, not incuding shave cream, new batteries, etc.), which is a bit high. The blade is great but the price is a lot. If you are willing to spend the extra money for a great shave, I have not found a better razor.UPDATED: The Gillette Fusion Power blades are even better than this product. At the time when I wrote this review, Fusion had not even been released. After using Fusion Power, I cannot return to this product any longer. Fusion provides an even LESS irritating shave to my skin that the M3 Power did, and seems to trim quicker and slide smoothly across my face with the proper shaving cream. I love the addition of the single precision blade on the backside of the razor blade, this provides me with a quick easy way to trim my sideburns evenly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
325,334,20080810,B00024C160,1,"August 10, 2008",ALDYEVKA2RYSO,Defective blades,Blades are defective out of the box and had to be returned. They emit a noise much stronger then usual when mounted on the handle. I had to return them to Amazon for a refund. I notice that the languages on the package are European (unlike English only on packages purchased at CVS for example). Perhaps there is a slight incompatibility between a European version and a US based version that makes these blades less then a perfect fit and hence destroys their smooth operation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For some reason Amazon had these Power Blades cheaper than the regular Fusion blades,(they look identical to me), plus they had free shipping and no tax. Much cheaper than any place in town.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oh well, on to the Fusion.I really cannot tell a difference in the quality of shave between the Fusion and the M3.  I agree with another reviewer, if all things are apparently equal why spend the extra money?One drawback to the Fusion is that it is hard to clean thick shaving cream out of it.  I\'m not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick.  I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it.  Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out.  I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades.  Either way it annoys me.To sum it up...sure it\'s a good razor, but it seems more novelty than anything else.  The M3 is good enough for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1920,826,20060621,B000BUW8WM,4,"June 21, 2006",A2032YC2PRGNSR,Long-time Mach III user had to upgrade,"Disclaimer:  I\'ve used the Mach III for my barely-less-hairy-than-an-ape face since it came out in the early-90\'s.  The Mach III served me well, but the head kept coming off, the result of dropping it about 4 dozen too many times.  I\'ve been a Gillette user for a couple of decades, now, but I\'m open to anything which works.  Hint:  I consider any electric, as much as I\'d like to have one, useless.  I\'ve had a few, it was a waste of money for me, but my friends got exceptionally good hand-me-downs.I was *ULTRA-SKEPTICAL* about a 5-bladed razor, *especially* a \'powered\' one.  I mean, my triple-bladed beast was still cranking along, and after 15+ years, I\'ve become accustomed to having my facial hair more pulled out than cut.  It\'s a genentic thing not many people seem to suffer from, which is good for the greater population.  Put it this way, I have \'5 o-clock shadow by 10 AM\'.  It\'s not a good thing.  If I skip shaving for 36 hours, I start to look like a psycho-drifter who has been on the road for a few weeks.Anyway, I sprung for the powered version, figuring I could use all the help I could get.  Shockingly, no pun intended, the shave was not only *amazingly* close, but I didn\'t have the typical 2-5 cuts from having a new blade.  To make matters better, I mananged to have even sideburns for a change.I\'ve been in Vegas about a year and the mid-to-late-70\'s fat Elvis has started to transchannel my sideburns.  Not mutton-chops...yet, but they\'re obvious.  ;-)Anyway, after not my first, but third powered-Fusion shave, about six hours after shaving (at which point I\'d ususally give my wife a rash if I gave her more than a peck on the cheek) I said to her, \'hey, feel my chin.\'  I got an immediate \'WOW!\'  It\'s so nice to look normal for an entire day.There are downsides.  Blades are stupidly expensive and don\'t seem to last more than a week, but the behavior was similar with my Mach III.  I\'ve considered having a ton of cartridges treated with near absolute zero cold, as that appears to help longevity, but have never gotten around to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

However, in comparison to the Mach 3, the Fusion\'s outrageously priced blades and clownish appearance are something of a step down.The quality of the shave is comparable to Mach 3. Some may quibble about subtle differences (Mach 3 better on the downstroke but Fusion better on the upstroke? :-), but however you slice it, we\'re well into the domain of greatly diminished returns on additional blades.As near as I can tell, the sixth blade on the back of the razor does... absolutely nothing.The shaving head is approximately the size of a battleship and maneuvers with all the grace of a 1967 Impala.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve tried the new ones, but my skin can\'t handle those multiple blades razor, so I have to downgrade back to Gillette AtraPlus, which worked the best for me.The shop was doing a really fast shipping with \'Prime\', and the product was as described.

453,463,20060419,B000BUUVTE,2,"April 19, 2006",A1GWQB7Q7I00N5,Very disappointed,"I ended up buying this only because I couldn\'t find Mach3 cartridges and was desparate for a new blade. The first couple days using the Fusion were okay, but I immeadiately noticed I couldn\'t get as close a shave as with the Mach3. A lot of this is that the Fusion has a large surface area, so it\'s hard to do a lot of detail work, sort of like painting with a roller brush. The single blade on the back is supposed to compensate for this, but except for doing a mediocre job of cleaning up strays under my nose, the single blade was useless. The first Fusion cartridge gave up on me after about a week and left my face barely looked different before and after the shave. Even after replacing the cartridge, my face seemed to get used to the Fusion quickly and stubbornly refused to give me a good looking shave, no matter how many times I scraped those Fusion blades over my mug. I also found myself working harder to get the shaving gel and water off the Fusion between strokes, which is annoying.I should say that my face is a little weird in that the hairs grow very slowly but are very tough. I used to shave against the grain (up the face) for this reason but found I could get away with shaving with the grain using a Mach3 regularly. So, for people with softer facial hair, the story might be different.The one advantage I\'d give the Fusion is that it does tend to work best when you only use one stroke down an area, so for people who get easily irritated by multiple blade strokes over the same area, this could help.I switched back to a Mach3 blade this morning though, and couldn\'t be happier. I have a lot more control over the shave, it\'s cheaper to buy the cartridges, and in general it\'s just a better experience. It will be a sad day when/if Gillette drops their Mach3 line, probably in favor of some 9-bladed shaving monstrosity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5662,1964,20100728,B003983HZK,5,"July 28, 2010",A2T8BSIIGDZYJS,Not Hype! Really Works The Best!,"Thought this \'improvement\' was yet more marketing hype from Gillette to get us to spend even more money for their blades. I was wrong. These are without a doubt the best blades I have EVER tried. Fantastic, close and very comfortable shave. No nicks. I have a very tough beard and the results are astounding. Definitely worth a try. I use the manual version.Note: I use these with Art of Shaving brand Unscented Shaving Cream applied with a Badger-hair brush, their Pre-Shave Oil and their Post-Shave Balm. I was always skeptical of high-priced shaving lotions and potions. But, I\'ve got to tell you these AOS products really work! After following their instructions, I\'ve never got such a close or comfortable shave. Get a sample and try it for yourself. I bet you your Edge gel or whatever shave cream you use now goes right in the garbage can. Don\'t get freaked out when you see the price. Actually, the AOS stuff really isn\'t that much more expensive (on a per shave basis) that the products you are using now. You use very little of it for each shave. Your face will thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fusion ProGlide Styler is a versatile, powerful-yet-gentle grooming tool. I\'ve always been reluctant to put a powered razor on my skin, so I also purchased the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Clear Shave Gel to serve as a conditioning buffer between skin and machine. I am impressed by the ProGlide\'s range of function in the shower. I\'ve found that the trimmer trims a lot more than beard, if you know what I mean. The kit includes enough accessories to make even the most high maintenance well-groomed person happy. On the down side, the cartridges sell at a price that would only make a Gillette stockholder happy, but they have a stellar performer on their shelves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	5	""October 12, 2009",A3OYO3Z2CHIHFS,Pinnacle of Manual Shaving,What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver?  It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It\'s now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it\'s thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers;  so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.  I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon.  This is a great product that can\'t be improved.  It\'s just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4415,1803,20120309,B003983HRI,5,"March 9, 2012",A1TM1BA7UE68A6,Tips for An Excellent Shave with the Gillette Proglide Razor,"I dare anyone to try my technique for the best shave you will ever get using a safety razor.  By far the Gillette Proglide is the best safety razor I have ever used and I have been shaving for over 50 years.But, to get the best shave with this razor or in fact, any razor you should follow these simple techniques:1.  Get a shower mirror, not that expensive, and shave in the shower at the end of your routine, make sure water is running and at a pretty good temperature.  The longer you stay in the shower before shaving the softer your beard will be and easier to shave.2.  Get yourself a bottle of Baby Oil, doesn\'t have to be Johnson&Johnson\'s any brand will do, even Walmart\'s brand.  I tried the Baby Oil gel, but it\'s too messy and gooey.  Just plain old Baby Oil.  Step away from the shower and put a good amount of oil on your face and neck. Rub it in as best as you can to make sure your beard is pretty saturated with the oil, you don\'t have to over do it, but just make sure you have enough oil on your face that you know it\'s there.3.  Shaving cream.  So far the best I have found is Aveeno\'s Therapeutic Shaving Gel. Available everywhere just about. Apply the the shaving gel OVER the oil that you put on your face.4.  That\'s it! Shave now like you would normally with your Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor.  You will not believe the closeness of your shave, plus your face is being nourished somewhat when using the Baby Oil.  The oil makes the razor glide smoothly over your face and actually lubricates the shaving blades, MAKING THEM LAST A LOT LONGER THAN IF YOU DID NOT USE THE OIL.Summary:  I change the Gillette Fusion Proglide blades once a month, honest.  Once a month! And I shave about 5 to 6 times a week.  Getting 20 to 25 shaves is nothing using this technique.  I probably could go longer than once a month, but can\'t be too cheap, lol.Hope someone tries this.  The combination of the Baby Oil and using Aveeno\'s shaving cream makes this all work in my opinion.  It\'s not that expensive to try if you already are using the Gillete Fusion Proglide razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vibration makes this Fusion feel a little like an electric razor -- or how I remember an electric razor feeling, because I haven\'t used one in years.  The sensation wasn\'t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.  In my experience, though, it doesn\'t.  I don\'t feel I\'m getting a shave that is any better or closer than I get with my regular, non-power Fusion.  And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly.  So, this razor isn\'t really delivering a closer shave, it\'s taking me longer to shave, and I found the vibration to be annoying.  It\'s not something I intend to use.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

Although I thought the five blades were a gimmick and put off trying it, I really do like it better than the previous Excel razors.  The \'precision\' blade on the top rear side is much more convenient than I would have expected, allowing me to get a good line on my side burns.  The blades last over a month for me, and I shave every other day on average (full beard growth, just sensitive skin).  When the Proglide Power razor went on sale for less than a new Fusion cartridge would cost me, I decided to give it a try.  Yeah, that was a no brainer.  :)  I liked the shave, and I decided to stick with it for another eight cartridges when this package went on sale.In my opinion, these aren\'t a big advance over the Fusion Power.  In fact, it doesn\'t seem much if any different to me.  The Fusion Power worked very well, and so does this.  These give a clean shave with minimal effort, even when I recently went five or six days without shaving over vacation.I was disappointed when the bottom glide strip on my first Proglide cartridge came loose.  I have never had a problem with a Fusion Power cartridge.  The two Proglide cartridges since then have held up nicely, though, so I think/hope it was an anomaly.So, I recommend giving these a try if you\'re unhappy with your current razor.  I do think that the Fusion Power are just as good, and they can probably be found for less money because they are the previous model, so you might want to try those first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try.  Big mistake.  This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.

I ordered this one from Amazon and I\'m not sure I can ever go back to another razor.  It is super gentle and effective.  It gives a closer shave then I\'ve ever had before.  And no razor burn!

At the time, the price was about $18 or so and I thought that was a great deal since these razors usually retail much higher.The razors showed up and I noticed a number of particular differences between my used old blades (bought from a supermarket). First the blade seemed a bit dull and dry when I shaved using the first blade in the package. It was so bad I had to throw it out immediately and tried the second..And then a third blade, etc..Needless to say ALL the blades were terrible..ALL THE BLADES! I found it strange that out of 16 blades, I wasn\'t even able to get one good shave and had to go buy the blades at full retail cost in person at a supermarket, and use my old turbo blade in the meantime. Another thing I noticed was the blue strip seemed to be made out of plastic and was not lubricating.Today is July 18, 2010 and I was thinking of buying some blades since I ran out and the price seems pretty reasonable...But then I noticed many reviews here with zero stars and talk of fakes.. Looks like I wasn\'t the only one.I am not sure where these reviewers bought their blades from (Marketplace or directly from Amazon) but I can say this:I bought my blades directly from Amazon, its a verified purchase and after reading the reviews here I think they sold me fakes.Thanks Amazon..Check your suppliers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For me, the soft rubber \'rumble strip\' that Gillette adds to these newer models just gets in the way and prevents me from getting as close a shave as I get with the good old Sensor. Another problem with the Gillette Fusion is the location of the pivot point between the handle and the cartridge; it\'s just plain awkward. That, coupled with the ribbed rubber strip, creates major shaving frustration. In any case, Gillette makes the best blades, at least for thick barbed wire beards like mine. Schick blades are garbage by comparison. They seem dull even when they\'re brand new, which leaves me a nicked-up, bloody mess. Gillette, I beg you, please don\'t stop making my tried-and-true Sensor blades!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I'll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.<br /><br />As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

2084,993,20080328,B000XVSNTQ,5,"March 28, 2008",AWPODHOB4GFWL,A Guys Point Of View,"It has been over four weeks where I have shaved only with this razor on my face stubble.  I used to use the \'cut the heck outta your face\' throwaway razors until I found the three-layer razor \'Gillette Mach 3\'.  This ladies Gillette has 5 razors!  I really liked the feel of the rubbery handle and the blades moves easily under and over my chin.  It rinses very easily in the tap and the shave feels even closer than the \'Gillette Mach 3\'!  I\'ll probably get at least a few more days out of this.I don\'t think the suction holder for your shower is my style, but it is a convenience.  The price is actually very reasonable compared to my \'Mach 3\' blades.  I might even think about changing over to this brand after I run out of my \'manly\' razors!  And no, I did not try this on my legs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4266,1648,20090422,B001JQLNFA,4,"April 22, 2009",A2OJCTT5WLB2HR,A Pretty Good Razor,"I have to say, I was hesitant with this product.  I was pretty much convinced it wouldn\'t work well.  I thought the shave gel strips would make the razor not shave close or that the shave gel strips wouldn\'t really be able to take the place of shave gel.  Then, I gave it a shot.  Wow!  The shave gel strips are quite effective and the razor shaved as close as any razor without the strips.  On purpose, I didn\'t use lotion or anything after shaving my legs to see if there would be any kind of razor burn from not using a shave cream, soap, etc.  Nothing!The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was due to what you get for the price.  The package says it is a one count, but goes on to say there are two of the head pieces included.  In other razors, this would typically mean there is one full razor (handle and head piece) and two refill head pieces.  On this, you get one handle and two head pieces.  At $10.99 a package, that makes these $5.50 each which is pretty pricey for a ladies razor.  I\'m also a little concerned that the life of the razor might be short because once the strips are gone, it is just a plain razor.  I\'ll have to update to let everyone know how long the strips lasted.UPDATEUnfortunately, this razor didn\'t stand the test of time.  The first shave was great.  The second was okay, but the strips were drying up.  On the third shave, one of the now dried up strips fell off.  On the second razor in the pack, it lasted about five shaves before one of the strips fell off.  So, I can\'t recommend this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1884,790,20070924,B000BUW8WM,4,"September 24, 2007",A1RQYQO7CLYV54,"I like it, but it is expensive","Updated 29-Jan-2009.  I\'ve been using this razor for several months, after waiting to hear from others just how well it works.  I have a fairly tough turf, shaving only MWF, resting on the weekends.  Up until this point, I liked Sensor Excel best, and detest every electric unit I\'ve tried. Since I really like the razor, I was surprised by some of the low rankings. I use Edge gel with extra lubricants, and I shave in the shower (yes, these things make a huge difference).Pro:-Blade life appears improved over my Sensor Excel-Vibrating handle not a gimmick, works well once you get used to it. Initially I found a lack of my normal \'feel\' when shaving, but quickly adapted-A beefy well-weighted handle with a secure seal for the battery.  Other razors have popped apart with the blade flying off on me if I dropped them, but not this one.  My Sensor Excel was notorious for this.-Large blade \'eject button\' is nice, yet doesn\'t let the blade pop off prematurely (see above)-The \'hole\' in the handle head is great! I have a wire rack that holds my shampoo and soap.  This same rack has a few \'hangers\' that this razor slides onto nicely-Very good battery life (still on the first one months later)-Plastic holder has a bigger \'foot\' to stay upright better and it\'s easier to see at a glance how many blades that I have left due to the clear sides, a feature that my Sensor lacks-On/off button flashes when battery gets low... hard to miss and allows you to get a least one shave-Best for last: a very close shave on a very tough faceCon:-Razor head is large, single blade on the back is a good idea and is sharp, but I can\'t seem to make it work as good as it sounds. It\'s a first generation idea that I am hoping gets some refinement.-Price... Ouch! Fewer blades per pack AND much more expensive. Buy in bulk, look for sales, save coupons-Plastic tray is much larger than my Sensor yet holds fewer spare blades (4).-Old blades from Sensor are not compatible with Fusion (you can mitigate this problem by taking your old shaver to work for those embarrassing days when you miss a small spot)Bottom line: Recommended if you\'ve got a rough face! Doing it all over again, I would buy it again.  Also, I recommend that you try different gels, shaving in the shower, different shaver brands as each face is different and Fusion is pricy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m not looking for a religious experience when I shave - just smooth skin without irritation, nicks or cuts.  The Proglide gives a good but not superior result, and Gillette\'s instructions for an optimal shave require too much prep time.  Also, Gillette hints that the razor may dull after 5 shaves.  It does and the \'special lubricating strip\' wears out sooner.  Frequent razor replacement in addition to the cost of a better quality shave cream is ridiculously expensive.  I\'ll continue to use the Braun (which has a surprisingly good shave block) for daily shaving, and save the Proglide for trimming my sideburns and neckline where it excels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have never had a razar that shaved so well.  I was given the Gillette Fusion before my deploymet to Afghanistan in late 2006.  I\'ve used all types of blades...single, double, triple and even dipilaties.  I was able to make one razor last 20 days throughout that deployment .  Did I mention that I use it to shave my head also???  Since my return at the end of 2007, I\'ve been getting a month out of each razor on both my face and scalp.  I start to get some drag after about twenty days but what razar gives you this much use that long?  It seems expensive when you\'re paying $20+ for each package but it last eight months. You have to admit, it\'s money well spent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Admittedly, not the best practice, but its habit now for 20+ years and I\'m not changing.This is an excellent razor.  Shaves quick and clean, even \'against the grain\' on the sensitive areas like my upper lip.  No razor burn, not irritation.  The vibrating action of the blade really seems to help over the standard versions.  The non-vibrating blades, even the nicer ones, always leave razor burn if I shave against the grain, so I am forced to go with the grain even though it does not seem to be as close of a shave.  This blade allows me to shave the way I want to, without the irritation I get with other blades.Even has a cool blue light on the power button that lights up when its turned on, not sure what good its for as the razor vibrates so its hard to forget that its on, but its neat anyway.Blade refills are rather expensive, but that seems to be a fact of life now on all razors unless you choose to go with the one piece, single use type.I have used the same blade daily for about 2 weeks now, and it just started getting uncomfortable.  I can live with that.  For anyone who used shave gel or foam, you could probably go a bit longer.I can unconditionally recommend this blade.  After all, you probably shave every day, why not use something that is comfortable and fast?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has five blades (!) and a wide surface that has strips of aloe vera all around the edges of the razor\'s `paddle\'. It gives a close shave.I really liked the handle which had soft plastic grippers on the surfaces so it doesn\'t slip (and they are comfortable to hold). The shape was easy to hold (unlike some other high-end women\'s razors I\'ve purchased in the past that had hard shapes to hold).The package I received came with what Gilette is calling a \'shower pod\' which is a holder for the razor and some refill cartridges that has suction cups that you can stick to your shower wall. It is convenient to hang it on the shower wall. It stuck to the smooth surface of my ceramic tile well.The refill cartridges come in sealed plastic packages so they can be stored in the shower, inside the shower pod, without rusting or getting the aloe vera strip worn down from water.To sum it up, it gave a great shave, the shower pod was convenient and the sealed refills are very practical.I have no complaints!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve been a big fan of the M3Power since its release.  I didn\'t buy in to the hype of the Quattro, especially since it\'s a manual razor.  I thought, \'three blades is good enough, what good could four blades do???\'  I only picked up the Fusion because I\'ve never had a bad experience with a Gillette razor...even when I picked up this Fusion, I was a little skeptical about the difference five blades would have over three.  BOY, was I wrong.  It\'s been written in a few other reviews here, but it bears repeating:  This is easily the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had.  Moving with the grain, it doesn\'t even feel like a razor is touching your face.  Even going against the grain, there\'s smooth action and no nicks.the only problem i had was with the head being a little too big to effectively catch the area under your nose.  HOWEVER, there is a single blade on the back of the cartridge for this exact purpose.  I applaud Gillette for the research and customer feedback that went in to the design of this razor.I hate to sound like a commercial, but my wife felt my face after I shaved, and she said that it was the smoothest my face has ever been.  I\'m VERY satisfied with my purchase, and you will be too.  I love this razor (as much as a man is allowed to love a razor.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only that, I used to have problems with hair getting stuck between the blades, whenever shaving after such an interval. with the Fusion it is not an issue. The hair washes off under the tap (means faucet for those who didn\'t understand \'tap\'), no struggling required.Expensive as it is (like other reviewers have observed as well), I\'m not going back to the Mach 3 that I used earlier. and certainly never to the Sensor excel I used before that.

Although both blades have the same shape and 3 blades, regular Venus blades cut me up without fail. Sometimes I wouldn\'t even notice and I\'d find blood on my white towels or sheets. I noticed a major increase in irritation and even had some bumps become infected. Even my lower legs, which have always been the easiest place for me to get a perfect shave felt rough after using these blades. I\'d always find patches I missed later, too.I always use a very high quality shaving cream to reduce irritation but even it can\'t compete with the amateur performance of Venus blades and I can tell you exactly why. Regular Venus blades do not have the comfort coating, smoothing cushions or multiple moisture strips of the Divine.

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn\'t any better.So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.- Now, here\'s the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I packaged up the entire original package as new, including the box, original receipt, and the cheesy complaint card you are entitled to write as per their refund guidelines. It cost me $12 to send all of this. Months later (seriously - like 2 1/2 months later!)they sent me back a letter & my receipt claiming that they cannot fulfill my request because I \'did not include the UPC code\'. The UPC code was on their packing!!! I sent it all back like new!!! More than they asked for!!!So - not only did I waste my time and an additional $12...but Gillette is wasting resources mailing this joke back to me...hence their costly product.I attribute this little event to Gilette not caring for my original review here on Amazon (below)...Hey America! Are why are we falling for this? Surely there are more of you who have noticed this disturbing trend of late?I am of Italian heritage with a heavy beard - I shave more whiskers in one stroke than most peach-fuzz Caucasians shave in a whole week...So if I don\'t need all these blades & tacky gimmicks - then no one does.All anyone requires is the original twin blade Sensor - loud, proud & simple. Easy to use with well-balanced quality. That was the Gillette I stuck with for many years. The Sensor was not impossibly wide/no annoying rubber fins/no vibrations/no batteries/no hype.This gimmicky, bulky, and overpriced nightmare fails to last any longer than a simple Sensor twin blade - here\'s why:The 5 blades here work well for the open expanse areas of the face...great. But they are way too wide to get at any tight spots like under your nose, upper lip, or any side-burn/mustache trimming. Gillette\'s solution is to flip over to a single trimming blade on the back. But here is where this entire concept fails: now we are down to the use & life of just this one blade!Get it?Once this one \'trimming\' blade is dull, the whole $3.00+ blade goes in the garbage!So really - it does not last any longer than a twin blade! With the old Sensor, we had the advantage of two blades hitting all the tight spots.And then there is this useless & goofy \'power\' business. So now, not only are we being forced to fork over $3.00+ per blade...but now we also have to start buying batteries. Gillette\'s stance on the environment? Well evidently their position is to now have millions more batteries going into our landfills. Lovely.And yes, Gillette is clearly bullying the marketplace as we longtime loyal customers can no longer find our favorites in the stores. And if we do - they are now priced double of what they were just a few short years ago. In fact, last time I found my Sensors at Walmart - there was a big sticker on the box asking the customer to call a 1-800 number to inform them if we \'see this product being sold elsewhere\'!! So much for competition and the free market economy!I remember everyone used to just go into the shaving aisle at the stores, grab their fave blades and leave. Now these aisles are full of price-shocked guys standing around scratching their heads, wondering what to do.OK, I understand that Gillette cannot effectively inventory all the retailers with every generation of product they ever made. I also believe in the evolution and optional availability of an evolved product. But give us the option of buying a simple twin blade at an affordable price and keep it readily available. But here Gillette has us over the barrel and is literally forcing everyone to pay a premium for what many of us do not believe is any better (in fact - annoyingly worse).If not, then I would say that this is an opportune time for the competition like Wilkinson Sword to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price. They would clean house. Unfortunately, I myself have not experimented much with the competition because of hit & miss availability. Don\'t want to find something one week - and then get stuck without the next. Hopefully that will now change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It took one try to conclude it was totally useless for my purposes.  I have a full beard that is cropped fairly close to the chin line.  I found the Fusion Pro Glide razor head too thick and bulky to perform any type of precision shaving at the edge lines.  Coupled with the trimmer as a handle, it was extremely awkward to use.  I attempted to use the battery operated trimmer along the lip line underneath my moustache and got nothing.  The trimmer is not sharp enough and does not get close enough to cut anything.  Trying to trim the rest of my beard with the snap on combs was an exercise in futility.  The trimmer head is too small and the 3 combs do not provide enough flexibility in terms of hair length.  All in all, I found this product to be a total waste of money.  The best part was the Duracell battery which I removed before throwing the rest in the trash.  Do yourself a favor and don\'t get taken in by s slick marketing campaign designed to sell overpriced razor heads.  If Gillette had spent as much money on the product as they did on the packaging it might be a different story.  There are a number of small rechargeable beard/moustache trimmers in the same price range that out perform this product and a variety of disposable razors that offer more precise shaving.  I\'d rather have a couple of products that perform well instead of one that does not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I love the protective ribbon that surrounds the blades.  It provides a comfortable glide over the skin -- especially around the tricky areas that other razors tend to snag or slice.  The five-blade razor head definitely creates a smooth shave without irritating the skin.  I love the way my legs feel after using the razor.  I also like the shower pod that allows for easy access and storage of additional blades -- right in the shower.  Overall, it\'s a great design of the razor that produces excellent results!(note: this review is by my girlfriend)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren\'t secured in their package.  Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  And since you\'ve already bought the item, there is no need for overly attractive packaging either.  The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can\'t re-use the packaging from the store).As far as longevity, I\'m probably about as tough of a test case as you can imagine.  I\'ve got thick, stubborn hairs on my next that lay sideways and reverse direction in certain spots.  Every time I shave these razors get a good workout.  When a razor is too worn, it is a painful experience and leads to immense amounts of irritation.  Needless to say, I notice pretty quickly when these get dull, and the razors from Gillette through Amazon take just as long to dull as do the razors from Gillette through the grocery store...this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.  This is the exact same product.  And, if you will still be shaving in a few months, do yourself a favor an subscribe for additional savings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could the Fusion be that much better than the Mach 3?  Was it worth spending $10 on?  In short answer YES!!!The FUSION follows every curve on your face like an Ariel Atom sticks to every curve and corner on the race track....The MACH 3 on the other hand feels live a Ford Festiva going around your face on 4 donut spare tires.Where the MACH 3 leaves short hairs for the 2nd pass the FUSION annihilates them in 1 pass.Where the MACH 3 lets your face feel like you need to shave again right after your done the Fusion turns your face into a smooth sheet of glass.My last point is that you need to invest in the Fusion cream (or some high end cream). This is the biggest problem; people skimp on the cream and don\'t get the best results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.I don\'t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it\'s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I\'ve never had any problems with the handle, and I\'ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.This particular deal for one razor and two cartridges at $3.19 is a great deal.

1638,538,20080713,B000BUUVTE,3,"July 13, 2008",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,"Over-priced, Over-bladed","The Gillette Fusion is Gillette\'s latest (as of this writing) offering to the world of manual shaving. Featuring five blades and a stunning new razor design, the Fusion is a truly attractive razor. But is it \'the best a man can get\'? Not for this man.Aesthetics: 4 stars. The Fusion design is truly excellent and far superior to other razors. The handle has been greatly extended compared to the Mach 3 handle, and a noticeable amount of weight and girth has been added as well. This is a razor that will feel comfortable in almost any man\'s hand. The blade cartridge itself keeps this razor from getting 5 stars in my opinion. Fusion cartridges are about the same size as cartridges for the average razor for women. This will require many men to slightly alter the way they shave their faces; however, the one-blade trimmer (on top of the razor) helps a good bit.The shave: a disappointing 3 stars. The Fusion gave me an incredibly close shave. I mean incredibly close. My face hasn\'t been that smooth since I was a child. I thought the trimmer worked well for its purpose. But -- and this is a big \'but\' -- the shave was honestly too close for comfort. After every shave with the Fusion, my face felt extremely sensitive for the rest of the day. I cannot help but believe that the 5-blade design caused the discomfort that I felt after using the Fusion. Perhaps other men will not have this issue. For those with sensitive skin (like me), your best bet might be to avoid the Fusion.Blade durability: 4 stars. This was where the Fusion blades really shined. With most razors, I typically have to change blades once a week. With the Fusion, I used the same blade for 2 weeks with no trouble at all. The blade still felt fresh after a week, and drag was minimal into the second week.Overall: The razor was decent. Certainly an impressive shave, but perhaps too close for some due to the unneccesary number of blades. The biggest problem with the Fusion is that the blades are insanely expensive. In my opinion, the cost of Fusion blades diminishes everything else that might be good about it.UPDATE: Decided to give the Fusion another shot by buying an entirely new system with a new blade. Still an incredibly disappointing razor with lots of irritation. It\'s just one or two blades too many. I cannot say the shave is any closer than a Schick Quattro or even a Gillette Sensor Excel on a good day. Would be nice to see Gillette take this razor design, with the longer handle and closer blade spacing, and port it over to a 3-blade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5804,2108,20100602,B003987CL0,5,"June 2, 2010",A2BTVCDA9MAKRV,BEST SHAVE EVER!!!!!,"I usually don\'t give product reviews. Even on stuff I think is worth a review but I had to with this. For me it has changed the way I feel about shaving tenfold. The fusion was good but I still had issues with razor burn. The proglide changed all that. Usually I go about a day in between shaving. After buying the Proglide on Saturday and shaving that evening, I didn\'t shave till Tuesday night & that\'s cause I wanted to. I could have went a couple more days but I like a smooth head so I shaved. I couldn\'t believe how close a shave I got with this blade and went for days without any razor burn or irritation at all and that\'s going with the grain. I always liked going against the grain cause it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was, my head couldn\'t take the pain afterwards so I stuck with going with the grain. With the Proglide I\'m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road I\'ll give it a shot because just going with the grain I get a damn close shave. I know it won\'t be the case for some other people but for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years. Highly, HIGHLY recommend buying this prduct.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wow!  This thing actually shaved me well, didn\'t but me up and even had a nice trimming blade on back.  I thought that a four blade razor would be too wide/long to shave well, but I was wrong.  The best part about the Fusion is that the blades last a LONG time.  I mean it\'s nothing for me to get two or three months out of a single blade.  Amazing.The only downside is that they are expensive, but considering how well they shave and how long they last, I still come out ahead.

I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn't! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.

4172,1552,20100918,B001G7PMW2,5,"September 18, 2010",A2OZIY67Q6ND06,Is what it is,"Ok, in perspective this is a good razor.  You could say it is a hybrid trac II.In my opinion, putting more blades on is a scam for you to buy more blades at a higher cost, keep in mind these are aluminium sharpened fine and coated for comfort, wrapped in plastic to attach at the head.Multi blades are going to last longer, common sense should tell you though, to put another 1-2-3 more blades in a razor shouldn\'t drive the cost up another $20.00 to $30.00.So as not to get off track, this razor system is great, the regular blades provide a close shave, the handle is at such an angle you can see those hard to get to places such as nose, sides, jawline.The sensor blades which are a little better, can provide a comfortable shave for people with more sensative skin, I find using barbasol with aloe or something comparable will give a close shave yet not have that burn afterward.My shave routine consists of:1.  cold water splash on the face, this tightens the pours of the skin and makes the whiskers stand up a little better.2.  I use barbasol regular, it\'s cheap, it\'s foam, and it does the job.3.  where you start is up to you, I usually start right to left going with the flow of the whiskers.  Never go against the grain as this will give you bumps (pseudofoliculitis barbae)and that can be a little uncomfortable or not look so good on that hot date or job interview.4.  after I shave i jump in the shower, however, if you don\'t always rinse.  This gets the cream off and any sediment such as left over whiskers and keeps them from entering skin pours and causing irritation, a big pimple or a serious infection.5.  Now, this is optional and I would recommend this for guys starting to shave.  Try some after shave lotion, it soothes the skin so you don\'t have that burn feeling all day, it also tightens the pours so you have a smooth shave longer and the girls appreciate a man that smells good and has a smooth face.i hope this helps some of you, pick what works for you.By the way gillette, I bet you are losing money on your blades, try lowering the prices for the everyday guy to afford to shave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6278,2588,20070130,B004B8AZH0,2,"January 30, 2007",A139ZF7CJVVTJU,Sometimes Less Is More,"Razor blades are expensive enough as it is, and the trend of \'more is better\' has reached almost ludicrous points in the industry.  What\'s that?  Five blades, you say?  Why, it must be better than four!  Meh.I have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck.  The good news is that, while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the problem.  In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades).  The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area).  If you have sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you.Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra \'trimming\' blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.However, the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast.  Considering my rather fine hairs, I\'m used to exchanging blades once every week or so.  Now I\'m exchanging them twice a week.  Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors\' products, and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That does come to be the case with the Gilette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor. I like it because it gives a strong clean cut shave right out of the gate when you use it. My biggest gripe though is that only after a few times because the blades in the cartridge are so thin, the razor does become quickly dull to the edge. So even to the visible eye, you lose that shave and you\'d have to earn those wings by quickly getting a refill for your Gilette razor. While it is a great concept, it can be a easier waste of money only after a short time. Hopefully, Gilette can come out with a razor that can be closer to the edge.Price: CConvience: COverall: C",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

Since I love trying out new products I decided to give it a try.  My first razor was a Mach 3 Turbo and I have been a loyal Gillette razor users.  Two weeks prior to purchasing the Proglide I purchase my first Fusion razor.  I was extremely disappointed by the power Fusion.  I always shave against the grain and it was painful.This problem has been eliminated with the Proglide.  It is a smoother, easier shave.  I HATE shaving but this razor makes it quick, easy, and painless.I would recommend it for anyone.  The blades are costly but with sales and coupons it should be managable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mach3 is the best yet, though I have yet to try the new Fusion razor.Gillette makes all sorts of claims regarding the Mach3.  I am unable to tell whether any of the claims have merit.  I can tell you that the blades, though expensive, last a long time for me.  I have moderately tough facial hair.  The old disposable razors gave me a few days of shaving and they were history.  I have shaved up to two months with these razors and still got a good shave.I have read that there are controversies about the value of three blades.  I think the three blades help keep the razor at the optimum angle on my face for shaving.  I do get a pretty good shave as well.  I do use Edge Advanced Shave Gel in combination with my Gillette Mach3, which may help get me a better shave.Most men in the United States shave, whether we like it or not.  The Gillette Mach3 gives me the best and most consistent shave I have ever had.  Until I find a better razor, the Mach3 is the one for me.Enjoy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I now use a simple old fashion safety razor which works great and the blades are dirty cheap.  Now I won\'t disagree that the Fusion cuts fine and I can shave in record time without fear of removing my Adam\'s apple but $4 a blade is just robbery.  For the most part I think I\'ll stick to safety razor for the bulk of my shaving and then finish up the \'scary\' areas with the Fusion.  This prolongs the life of the Fusion.  The safety razor actually works better if you let your whiskers grow longer as since it\'s single blade it never clogs.If you currently use the old Fusion then I fail to see any benefit in this new model.  I\'m sure they have some lovely marketing but in the end it\'s 98% the same and I couldn\'t tell the difference.  Perhaps the biggest fluff is the \'power\' feature.  It\'s completely useless and IMO is just an attempt to add another disposable item to this razor.  I\'m not sure who asked for their razor to shake in their hands but that\'s not what I want while I\'m shaving around my lips or throat.  I wound up keeping it off while I shave.  I\'m also still not a fan of the flip back behavior of the Fusion... I prefer the head to stay still but since this isn\'t new then maybe you\'re fine with it.Overall it\'s a fine razor, but it\'s a marketing (not engineering) upgrade with goals to charge you just a bit more per blade but it\'s already too much IMO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She found the handle to be easy to grip, the gel area around the head to be comfortable and the wall holding unit to be well designed and useful. She also stated that the shave from this razor was closer than most she has tried.The only drawback to the razor is the replacement blades, which, when compared against disposable razors, can run into some money. Since I am the sucker that spends the money on new blades, she and I will have to have a talk about just how much extra this unit is worth.

Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn't provide a cover for the blade area.

1883,789,20071030,B000BUW8WM,5,"October 30, 2007",A16QODENBJVUI1,A special thank you to Gillette for this razor,"I almost never review products apart from books, CDs, movies, DVDs, and electronic devices.  This is one of my rare exceptions.  So why am I do ing this?  Last April I developed a blood clot in my right calf as well as a small one just above my knee.  As is usual in these cases, I was placed on the anticoagulation medicine Warfarin (the generic form of Coumadin) for six months.  This past saturday I was officially taken off Warfarin.Why do I bring all this up?  I was told in April that I was going to have to be very careful not to cut myself shaving.  If I did, I might have a great deal of trouble stopping the bleeding.  I had bought this razor literally the week before my blood clot.  I had been using the Mach 3 before this and often cut myself using it.  I was somewhat dubious about using this new razor and its five blade, but I liked the very, very close shave it gave me.

I have to say that I am thankful I didn\'t pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I\'ve ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for \'precision\' is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can\'t be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o\'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What\'s next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle?

I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

I\'ve fiddled and hated all stand alone beard trimmers. Either overpriced or left hair in the drain. Or broke. You need to consider shaving/trimming in the shower-- hair goes down the drain. Use a $15 fog free mirror. No more cleaning sinks. No more splashing water all over the sink and mirror. This Braun designed gem is water resistant. PERFECT.

5822,2127,20100524,B003987CL0,3,"May 24, 2010",A2KHG3JOFXQ4CE,Great Shave But It WILL Cost You,"I had used the predecessor of this model for a few years right up until I retired 18 months ago. When working, even though I made enough money then to buy the EXPENSIVE replacement cartridges, it always left me complaining about the price of such a wonderful shaving experience. Now that I am retired, I had switched to the old fashioned safety razor and began buying assortment packs of different manufactures blades till I found what works best for ME. Turned out, the very cheapest of the dozen brands, works best for me so I have been much happier shaving the old fashioned CHEAP way.  Enter this new version of my old friend....I had to try it since the one biggest downside for me with a so called safety razor is cutting myself. Since a recent heart attack and the blood thinner medication I now have to take, cuts are becoming a real problem. And this razor is SO much safer as well as more comfortable, I had to try it when offered on the Vine Program. Feels the same, looks a little better (to me anyway) than my old unit. Now, this \'soothing micro-pulses for incredible comfort\'? OK, if you say so....Myself, it is simply a major distraction! I can\'t feel what is going on since the vibration is just a MAJOR distraction to the shaving for me. I simply have stopped using this \'feature\'. Every beard is different, every shaver has their own preference. What one loves, another hates etc. Needs are different, results are different. I kind of found all the razor & blade reviews to be sort of useless for me since there are simply too many variables involved in this activity?  But there is one place this series of razor really excels. COMFORT! Vibrate or not, I would really have to want to cut myself, and want to badly to do so. It is buttery smooth for my face. That simply OUTRAGOUS price for new blade refills is somewhat offset by the fact this 5 blade model lasts a bit longer than my single blade safety razor blades. But it still costs so much more, that this return to this razor will end for me, once these blades are done. It is safe, comfortable, and such a close shave, I hate to leave. But retirement pay is just 1/5th of my old working paycheck and this is right at the top of the list for things to cut (bad pun...). Another thing I love about this razor is when I get up in the morning to shave, I have probably only 1/3-1/4th the beard to shave as compared to the next morning if I had used my trusty safety razor.  Bottom line? IF you can afford it and don\'t mind allocating this much money for new blade cartridges, enjoy! It is an amazing tool. I just won\'t spend the money anymore. And another thing, maybe it\'s just me? I see, nor feel, ANY difference in the closeness of the shave either using the vibration feature or NOT using it. When I use it, I really have trouble knowing how well it is cutting. I mean, I have NO sense of if it is cutting or not? Off, it is simply a wonderful razor, but one last time...IF you are willing to pay the high price. Wish I made more money!_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5/28/2010 Update:  OK, I have found another problem with this razor that applies to \'me\' but probably not to the general shaving public? I have several deep scars/crevice wounds to my face from my motorcycle & jet ski racing days (crashes...) This razor simply can NOT get into those areas where a single blade safety razor has NO problem. So if you don\'t have a perfectly smooth (scar free )face, it may not work well for you? I also did some math on replacement blades. Figure around $3.50-$4.00 per refill on this razor. On my safety razor, my blades cost me just 15 CENTS! That 15 CENTS, shaves me perfectly for 7 days. After that, the shave degrades till at 10 days, I no longer have comfort using it. So maybe this can be a guide to the insane cost of using this razor. Bug again, it is such a subjective thing. To someone who has a decent job, they may consider this cost trivial? Or, not even have realized just how out of line it is with alternatives out there. For me, back to the future with a good old safety razor works best. Now I remember why....Take a look at: SHARP STAINLESS Double Edge Polymer Coated Safety Razor Blades for instance. Then look at all the choices for blades in the good old fashioned safety razor. I would give this:- 4 stars for closeness on a smooth face-- 3 stars on a face with scars-- 1 star for cost-  Over all, I let my 4 stars stand since (again),shaving is a very personal & yet subjective thing. One razor doesn\'t fit all.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5/31/2010 Update:Well this will get me some hate mail but I have to downgrade my review from 4 stars to just 3 stars. Reason? I used to get up to 3 weeks of close shaves on the OLD style (see my pictures). This new one with new & \'improved\' thinner blades? Just 7 days and it is cutting me like crazy. But remember, I have to take blood thinner since a recent heart attack. More to the point, I have to ask myself, was this redesign just a way to make sure that the great (but expensive) shave of the old model, would be even better (but ONLY for the manufacturer?) if they discovered a way to get the old design blades not to last so darn long? If so, they REALLY succeeded! This blade is just used up for me after just 7 days. Now my old fashioned safety razor only costs about 15 CENTS. This one? How about $4.25 each???? Sorry, but that is just INSANE!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Pivot Plus razors seem to be identical with the older Custom Pivot Plus except for their color. I have now used the Pivot Plus for several months and usually use each one for a week.

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

	1	""April 9, 2010",AAX9J3ILB1XNT,A giant step backward!,"I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn\'t waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3\'s were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I\'ve had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an \'upgrade\' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you\'re handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, \'What were they thinking?!\' crosses my mind.  I\'ve discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

      </div>

My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.

Gillette Clinical Strength Advanced Solid Anti-perspirant is an ideal anti-perspirant for most of my needs. It works almost instantly and it lasts throughout the day. It is odorless and it leaves no white residue. However, it does make your armpit hair sticky, but that is the case with almost any anti-perspirant that is available out there. Overall, this product works as advertised and I would strongly recommend it to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s great for people on the go, easy to put in a gym bag etc. It\'s also less stuff cluttering your shower, which I\'m down for. On first use, it works great. Shaves easily, no nicks, close shave. It is a little stringy( seeing little strings of gel from the razor to your skin), but it doesn\'t really make a difference using it, its just a little odd. My legs felt nice afterwards, not parched and dry. But I always follow up with a shea body butter when I get out of the shower anyway, so that\'s never been a big concern of mine.The down side is that the shaving gel bar part is going to be gone long before the razor(maybe after 3-4 uses). I use my Venus cartridges probably longer then most...1: because I\'m not obsessed with the closest shave ever and 2: because I feel guilt pangs whenever I throw something like this in the garbage(trying to be green here!). So eventually I know I\'ll be using this particular razor with my traditional shaving cream despite the fact that it started off easy-peasy. Would I buy it again? Maybe if I saw the cartridges on super sale. But on the whole, I\'m doing just fine with my other venus \'divine\' razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

446,456,20120111,B000BUUVTE,5,"January 11, 2012",A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,My favorite multi-blade razor!,I only use a manual razor as I have yet to find an electric one that will cut my whiskers without seeming to pull them out.  I prefer the multi-blade razors as they always seem to do a better job and the best I have used so far it this Gillette Fusion.  The five blade head shaves my face smooth on the first pass and I do not have to often reshave an area over.  Multiple shaving over the same place tends to give me razor burn.The flexible head follows the contours of my face and always keeps the blades at the proper angle for a clean close shave.  The single blade side is good for trimming my side burns and my mustache.  I also like the Lubrastrip and when it is gone it is about time to change blades.  It is a good indicator of the razors usage.The grip elastomer coating on the handle makes it nice to shave with as you can get a firm grip on the razor even with wet and soapy hands.  Overall it is a good design and it works well for me! I get a close comfortable shave.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4209,1590,20090917,B001JQLNFA,4,"September 17, 2009",A3C6CZC2JP67VK,This razor does the job for your legs,"I tried the Venus Divine, wasn\'t too impress. I was using the Venus Spa Breeze, and I loved it. Couldn\'t pass up this offer so I to give it a shot -- I love it. However, it gets 4 stars instead of 5 cause mainly I had to change cartridges after 2-3 shaves, which I guess I really should be doing. I was impressed with the first couple of shaves, but noticed the gel strips dying quickly on me in the shower. Once they fell off, I found the razor head overly cumbersome to use (especially since a standard Venus razor head is no petite thing). Plus I accidentally left this off the pod and near water one day. The next day, the moisture strips were gooey and eroded.If I were going away and not expecting to have to shave my legs more than three times or so, this would be an excellent alternative to lugging along a shaving gel and razor. If you\'re looking for something to last, though, I\'d go with the Venus Divine because it last way longer probably up to 5 uses. Still, I have had no other problems with this razor and find that it is pretty moisturizing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5745,2047,20100810,B003987CL0,5,"August 10, 2010",A99BPI4IGPB2Y,Best Gillette ever -- and it\'s actually CHEAPER!!,"I won\'t repeat what some of the other reviewers have said about how well the new Power Proglide shaves, but suffice it to say, it\'s the most comfortable shave I\'ve ever experienced (and I have a very sensitive neck). It\'s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.  To the couple of reviewers that say they couldn\'t tell the difference, I\'d say you\'re either shaving wrong or do not have sensitive skin.  With the Fusion Power, I\'d pretty much have to shave in the shower to avoid razor burn on my neck.  With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving -- no razor burn at all (or ingrown hairs), even shaving against the grain on my neck.Here\'s what a lot of the reviewers are missing. On the Fusion Power, I had to change blades every 7-10 days. Any more than that and I\'d get torn up. I\'m in my TENTH week of using the Power Proglide blades, and I\'m on my THIRD BLADE!!! It\'s JUST about time to change, but I could still probably handle another shave or two with no less comfort than I had with the regular Fusion Power blades. 3 BLADES in 67 days!!  And the other cool thing is that these blades work perfectly on the Fusion Power chassis, so no need to buy the new Power Proglide razor (unless you just want to upgrade for the looks).So yes, individually, the blades ARE more expensive than any other blade. But the cost savings, even over just a year, will be SIGNIFICANT for me -- almost $60/year vs. the Fusion Power... AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHAVE EVER??? It\'s a no brainer!!Update:  Still LOVING this shaver almost a year later.  I did determine that what you\'re using for shaving cream makes a BIG difference.  I\'ve used Neutrogena for Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream for years, but decided to try an organic one from Kiss Your Face.  Lots of razor burn and discomfort with that cream, even with a brand new blade (tried it for two days).  So, back to the Neutrogena and couldn\'t be happeier with the Fusion Power ProGlide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6515,2830,20120129,B0062IWQVU,5,"January 29, 2012",A2JLQBD9IDT5QV,"The perfect daily groomer for your beard, and your hair","I picked up one of these at the local drug store last night after having a coupon to get $3 off. I had a similar styler, but the blades were dull and a pain to groom myself with. It\'s quick, fast and easy to use, helping you to always look your best with all your quick grooming needs.For as cheap as the Gillette styler was, it sure is my new favorite tool to groom with! It\'s got a lot of nice features that more expensive stylers have, but for around only $20, plus it\'s water proof for use in the shower! First off let\'s start with the fact that it uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges, how amazing is that? I can now toss out my old fusion power pro-glide handle since this one works even better. The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates just as well, if not better than the standard power handles on the disposable shavers.The handle is nicely molded, very clean look and provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not hard plastic, so you won\'t find yourself dropping the styler or having it slip out of your palms. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding.You can use the standard motorized blade directly on your skin without worrying about cutting yourself, or scratching up your skin. It\'s sharp, but only for your hair. It also includes 3 different style \'combs\' to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you\'d want to trim. With all these little plastic attachments here and there though, you\'ll need a place to store it all! Gillette is two steps ahead of you, because the packing it comes in also doubles as a stand and accessory holder for the styler itself, and all the little attachments included.One nice thing not many shavers or stylers have is the ability to open the compartment behind the blade to clean out hair that can cause jams. The Gillette styler has a hatch you can pop off, and snap right back down to clean out any hair or gunk so your styler never jams, and will always work reliably. This is a huge plus for me since my old one was becoming weak and dull from all the hair trapped in the mechanism slowing down the blade and motor.Besides the styler and the accessories, I received Gillette brand cooling lotion to use after shaving, and non burning shaving gel. I tried both, and liked them very much. The shaving gel made my hairs pirk right up after a few seconds, making shaving so much easier. I felt no burn or sting while using the gel, so it really does work. Afterwards I put some of the lotion into my palms and rubbed it onto my face where I had shaved, it did have a nice cooling effect, but I could have lived without the lotion, it has a nice light scent to it too.For under $20, the Gillette Styler really can\'t be beat. It\'s cheap in price, high quality, comes with tons of accessories and samples, and it does a good job. It would make a great gift to any guy you know, or a gift to yourself!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6284,2594,20061106,B004B8AZH0,4,"November 6, 2006",AN9Q4QY93VLLF,"Finally, something worth upgrading to","I still believe that Gillette has not done anything spectacular since the Sensor razor blade.  All the upgrades since just seemed more gimmicky to me (lotion pad that wears after 2 uses, extra blade that makes the razor too big), and based on previous changes I would have ignored this one. However I got the razor and 1 blade free in the mail and gave it a try.  I have been using the same blade for 4 weeks now and I love this thing.  I feel like that thing performs wonderfully well.  The shaves are close and it has minimized the need for shaving in reverse which i need to do.  Also i feel that the strips on this last longer because i still get that squeeky clean and smooth feeling each time.  Another big plus is how easily the hair is cleaned from this blade.  The running water removes all hair thanks to the design that leaves the front and back of the blades fully exposed.  I must say that this product exceeded my expectations.  However, i have taken off a star due to its expensive blades (almost $3.50 per blade, retail). When i go back to my original shaving system, i will decide if this price is worth paying but somehow i doubt it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn't any better.<br /><br />So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />- The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).<br /><br />- The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.<br /><br />- Now, here's the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!

512,522,20100409,B000BUUVTE,1,"April 9, 2010",AAX9J3ILB1XNT,A giant step backward!,"I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn\'t waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3\'s were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I\'ve had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an \'upgrade\' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you\'re handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, \'What were they thinking?!\' crosses my mind.  I\'ve discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I\'ve tried practically every razor on the market in search of something which doesn\'t cause irritation. Simply put, this razor has proven to be the best I\'ve ever used. Unlike most razors, it does exactly what it claims to do: glides across the face and neck without even a hint of friction or irritation. Thus, it\'s now my razor of choice.That said, the ProGlide isn\'t cheap. In fact, at roughly three dollars a cartridge the cost of ownership is fairly outrageous. So I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend it for everyone -- the second-best razor I\'ve found is the King Of Shaves Azor, which is FAR less expensive (it can be bought online from the brand\'s site).

The best is still the man with the cut-throat... but who can trust a man wielding a cut-throat??I will say that with the extra blades I s1eem to have lower frequency of shaving cuts and the process is less arduous - effectivity of the shave process is slightly increased...What does surprise me is that the cost of the blades is not reducing, are we paying for technology with no return Mr Gillette??????????",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4350,1735,20090716,B0028K3IZY,4,"July 16, 2009",A34VCCL1YO6D0I,"Very good, very effective",I always like to read the other reviews before posting my own.  Usually the other reviews merely validate my own opinion.  Rarely do I find myself disagreeing with the reviews significantly.  Although I am rating the item 4 stars like most I do find the reasons for complaint or praise are different from myself and my fellow reviewers.Pros:1.  Light smell.  Many seem to complain about the strong smell.  I find it not too strong.  Maybe this is my nose not working but I find it pleasant.2.  Shirt friendly.  I have seen a few reviewers complain about the shirt staining.  I recommend you change detergent.  I have never had a problem with staining of shirts or even residue during the day.3.  Glides well for a non-gel stick.  I like the application of gels but this does a nice job and does not pull hair.Cons:1.  The mix is so water repellent that washing it off in the shower is a bit of a pain.  A minor issue but one I am reminded of each morning.A very good stick that is easy in application and seems effective in odor and moisture control.  Nicely done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less enthused when I read further and found out they won\'t ship to Alaska because this is a decent price on these cartridges and the subscribe option looks great.My husband and I have been using Sensors for the last 20 years. They give a nice clean shave and the blades last us a week which is a lot better than how quickly newer razors seem to last since they are so thin to have so many blades in a cartridge. I also like the smaller head for getting around curves on my legs.We have tried some of the newer razors with more blades and other options, and keep going back to the Sensor.

I tried this one ONCE on my face and cut myself in two places. It is just too big. HOWEVER, I am an avid cyclist and body builder and shave my legs and chest. THESE WORK GREAT for large areas like legs or chest if you are \'into\' that aspect of the sports. I have to shave at least once every two days or I get complaints from my wife when I cuddle up to her at night. I like the definition of my legs much better shaved as well as my abs and chest.

4110,1489,20101228,B001F51QWK,5,"December 28, 2010",A221UIO0NQ6FP,"Good shave, blue lubricating strips better than green","Review revised to 5 stars after manufacturer changed lubricating strip.  The new blue lubricating strip now lasts longer than the blades, and I use these for about 7 shaves (the older green strips did not last as long -- see below).  At this point I have no reservations and can fully recommend the product.OLD REVIEW:I like the shave that these give -- the blades are sharp and I rarely cut myself when they are fresh.  I think that the lubricating strip is better than most when I first use the razor.However, the lubricating strips don\'t last quite as long as other razors I\'ve used and I find myself wanting to replace them after about 5 shaves (I kept my previous razors for about 7).  In contrast to my other experiences, the blades are still sharp, but the lubricating strip is completely gone.  For what it\'s worth, I keep my razor in the shower -- I assume it\'s possible that they will last longer if I keep it elsewhere.Because of the good shave at first, I continue to subscribe to these razors.  I just factor in a higher cost because I go through them faster than other razors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2264,1175,20100116,B000XVTYYY,4,"January 16, 2010",A3FCG8UXEV0OPD,close shave except under nose,I used the Gillette Sensor 2 blade razor for years. Gives an excellent and as close a shave as possible but not easy on skin; left it chronically slightly rough. The 3 blade Mach 3 was as good but couldn\'t shave under nose closely. The Fusion solved both problems. Shaves as close as the Sensor and has the single edge to shave under nose. And it is very easy on skin of face. The Fusion lasts a month shaving once a day; I\'ve timed several blades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every time they came up with better product until this one. The blade life is so short for fusion and that made me try to use Schick Quattro. I have been using the first blade of Quattro for last 4-5 months and blades stay healthy. Quattro is only just a little less comfortable compared to new fusion but stays fresh for much long. I am not switching back to Gillette.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aloe strips around both sides of the blades make for a very well lubricated shave, too.  Some may perhaps find it to be too much, but it works well.  So, the razor set up works well.  My wife\'s legs turned out great with it, and I even gave it a go on my face.  Both proved successful.But the holder to go in the shower, which would be a great thing if it worked, just falls off the wall, no matter how we tried it.  So, I wouldn\'t put much hope into the holder working.The starter set here comes with an extra blade, and the holder at least works to store back-ups.So, a good razor pick-up, but an apparently unreliable shower dispenser.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although designed for women, my wife & I both use this to save space in the shower & I can say it works equally as well for both of us. Haven\'t gotten a nick yet, which for me is high praise.

Actually I bought it for my father who is very naive in using advanced technologies. The manual version of this razor was perfect for him. He likes it so far. The precision of shaving is great. It is little expensive as compared to other available razors. But it is a great product for the amount you pay. I would recommend this one to others.

I got a better shave with a single blade off brand disposable razor.,"I was not a big fan of the previous Gillette fusion because it irritated my skin and gave me very uncomfortable shaves. I thought that this one would be an improvement and I was excited about getting the pro glide version. Like a dummy I didn\'t test it first and got the bulk set from Costco.This is by far the worst razor ever. There was no gliding at all, it was more like grinding. It irritated the hell out of my skin and it was the most uncomfortable shave ever. It felt as if it was pulling each hair out of my face and I was bleeding everywhere. At first I thought that OK maybe its was this specific blade I was using so I got another blade, the same. The next morning I pulled out  an old unused single blade disposable I had for emergencies and it was much more comfortable then this one. I absolutely hate this razor, I ended up giving away the other unused blades. I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor. Felt great. Best shave ever. This did everyting that the Pro glide promised to do. I had no irritation of the skin and the shave was very comfortable and close.I would NOT recommend this razor at all. I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I thought that this was supposed to the best for sensitive skin...WRONG.Do yourself a favor and don\'t spend you money on this overpriced crap. Get the Shick Hydro or any other disposable razors, they will do a better job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

I tried it I don\'t know how many years ago and it\'s remained my razor forever.  I have very sensitive skin and used to get razor bumps and those little red pores when I\'d shave my legs.  Now I realize I shave every single day, underarms and legs, and I always get a smooth shave, barely ever a nick, and NO bumps or anything.  People have commented on how smooth my legs are.  I can\'t guarantee this will work for everyone but for me it\'s an excellent product.  Yeah they have you over a barrel for the pricey refills but the blades do last a long time, even though I shave daily.  I have never used it for the bikini area so can\'t speak to that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1675,575,20060506,B000BUUVTE,3,"May 6, 2006",A1YD2WQDJUQWS,The good and the bad,"First, the bad. The Precision Trimmer is way overhyped. In theory, it\'s a great idea: it\'s difficult to get sharp symmetrical lines using an ordinary razor, and one would think a single blade would do the trick a lot better. In practice, though, this doesn\'t work. In the first place, either the blade isn\'t sharp enough or it\'s burried too deep inside the cartridge to be truly precise. And secondly, whatever hairs it trims just get stuck in the blade - and it\'s a real pain to get them out.The good. Fusion isn\'t worse than Mach3. This was actually a great relief following the disappointment of M3Power which was a disaster. I can\'t say yet if Fusion gives a superior shave to Mach3 Turbo, but it stands to reason that five blades would perform better than three.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve experimented with this razor for the past few days.  I will not be permanently upgrading to this.  For some reason, Gillette appears to have completely bought into the notion that five blades gives a better shave than just two or three.  Like the Fusion Power, the Fusion Proglide Power has some of the same problems.  The most obvious problem it has is cost (just like the Fusion Power).  For the quality of the shave you get, the cost of replacement cartridges is not justified.  To be fair, I have noticed a slightly more comfortable glide with this over the Fusion Power.  The blade stabilizer and microcombs do appear to be a modest improvement in this regard.  Also, the Fusion Proglide blades appear to last a little longer than the Fusion Power blades - but not by much.  The micropulses still do not provide a greater degree of comfort over a razor that lacks this feature.  Also, I have not noticed a closer shave with this razor over the current one I am using (which is now the Schick Hydro 3).  When comparing it my current razor, the Fusion Proglide Power definitely lacks the level of smoothness and comfort.  Last but not least, just like its predecessor, I\'ve discovered this five bladed razor tends to nick my face more often than a double or triple bladed razor.  Gillette needs to get back to basics by realizing it is much easier to keep a satisfied customer who gets a good, comfortable shave as opposed to introducing new brands of razors that have gimmicks, and that are, not to mention, ridiculously overpriced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lubricant is not smooth and only lasts 2-3 shaves before completely fading, the blades cut my face from the first try of each blade, and I never get a close shave from these fakes.

1926,832,20060519,B000BUW8WM,5,"May 19, 2006",A2T049UQONS0OY,Another winner from Gillette,"I have only one criteria for any razor -- that it give me a close shave in the shower without cutting me. It\'s amazing how few razors meet this criteria. The new unpowered Gillette Fusion razor does this better than the older Gillette model it replaced.For me, my beard tends to outgrow razors. I can live with one for a few years and then, suddenly, I find it no longer gives me a close shave. That\'s when I know it\'s time to change.What\'s different with Fusion is I need hardly any effort to remove facial hair and don\'t need much pressure from the hand or wrist. Just get the thing on my face and move it and it does the job even on my chin, under my nose, off my jawbone and in those other spots where lines are hardly flat or straight. The razor has another cutting edge on the back you can use for straight cuts to sideburns or elsewhere,  if you choose.I cut myself a few times the first time I used Fusion and was concerned the five cutting edges may be too much for me. But I quickly adjusted by releasing the pressure in my shaving hand and now take a close shave sans cuts for granted every morning of my life.Ergo, this razor meets my only criteria expertly. I\'d recommend this product to anyone that wants what I want, a close shave without cuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decades ago there was a TV ad parodying the escalation in the multiple-blade razor wars, with a funny animation showing what supposedly happened to each beard hair as the successive blade edges passed over it. The mock slogan: \'Because you\'ll believe anything.\'I got tired of paying for the 4-edge and 5-edge blades that now cost several dollars apiece. The simple double and triple blades are getting harder and harder to find, let alone at a reasonable price, so I was delighted to hear I could get them on a \'subscription\' basis from Amazon. The Gillette Sensor Excel blades arrived fast, and they work great. Additional blades will be mailed to me at regular intervals, and I can terminate the subscription at any time. Good deal!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

First off, the single blade is absolutely useless, it cuts nothing, it\'s just a gimmick. This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90% of the replacement blades, I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop (presumably glue) all over the blade, with the single blade missing! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems, as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet, and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality. I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke, but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades, I think it\'s time to call a spade a spade. I shave my head and my face both, and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors, and even with a fresh blade, many times it feels as though I\'m shaving my face/head with a sharp rock. needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve been battling white deodorant marks on my family\'s clothes for years from deodorants that claim not to leave a white mark. So...I rubbed this deodorant onto some fabric...low & behold...it didn\'t leave a white mark! If it doesn\'t leave yellow deodorant stains on clothing, especially noticeable on white clothing, that will be fantastic. Those yellow stains are hard to get out, but it can be done. It will take a few months to see if yellow stains develop. I\'ll update with those results.My husband is testing this for me. So far, it\'s behaving like an  anti-perspirant/deodorant should by keeping him dry and odor free.I think the Arctic Ice fragrance is a bit strong, some might call it bold, but it does smell clean and fresh.UPDATE: We\'ve been using this deodorant for 4 1/2 months. So far, I haven\'t noticed any yellow, underarm build-up (the kind I usually see on white garments). We\'ll be purchasing this again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6369,2680,20120208,B004B8F8MM,1,"February 8, 2012",A3E3U5OUW2C6HX,Doesn\'t look the same,The box that the product arrived in was labelled Fusion Power but when I opened the box the cartridges looked different from the ones I normally purchase at my neighborhood drugstore. First off they were colored orange while the ones I get at the drugstore are blue. Secondly on the actual plastic package where the cartridges are embedded the label says Gillette Fusion while the ones I get at my drugstore colored blue says Gilette Fusion Power.In summary I don\'t think this is the real Power Fusion as it is very different than the ones you can buy at the local drugstore. I decided to try to purchase here at Amazon because of the compelling price difference after buying the Power Fusion at my drugstore ever since Gilette introduced this new product into the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind.  I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.<br />In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don't smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.

6293,2603,20060206,B004B8AZH0,4,"February 6, 2006",A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,Nice Shave But I\'ll Stick With The M3 Power,"I have been using Gillette\'s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it\'s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette\'s other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	5	""February 10, 2010",A2IJ8OWXSJQV27,Best razor I\'ve used,"I have a very sensitive face. After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated, I switched to electric. Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically. It was the first blade shaver that worked for me. Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

I've been using this stuff for years now and I have to say that although I have strayed a few times and tried competing products, this one still remains the best.  I perspire a lot.  I have a condition called hyperhydrosis.  Basically, that means I perspire a lot.  The Gillette Odor Shield Smells great, feels fresh and clean, doesn't irritate my skin and is so powerful that you could even miss a day.  Highly recommended for everyone!

I loved it and kept it sharp by rubbing the blade with an alcohol prep pad and storing it *outside* the bathroom to make it last longer. It worked, too!I always buy a pack of cheap disposables for summer travel: to my parents\' house, to his parents\' house, on vacation, everywhere. I ran out of the Schick Quattro disposables so I figured I\'d try something new. My brother\'s girlfriend is half Mexican so she has SUPER thick hair - she told me to try the Custom Plus Pivots out.Wow. What a razor! For 1/3 or 1/2 the cost of a Mach 3 blade you get an ultra sharp, durable and long lasting razor. The moisturizing strip is HUGE!I can\'t believe these are so great. I will say that for bikini line usage I still slightly prefer the Mach 3 because it can pivot more than these do. These are great for legs, armpits and face.Overall a steal!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little skeptical when ordering this product but was so tired of being sweaty all the time that I decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did because it worked just as advertised!<br /><br />I put 2 clicks of the anti-perspirant under each arm before bed and the next day I don't break a sweat until my cardio training each evening. Even then, the amount of perspiration is incredibly light given the intensity of my workout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.

	5	""July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4004,1380,20090520,B001F51QJ8,5,"May 20, 2009",A24RT6AVJXJZHF,Wins me over from using a similar product by Unilever simply on design.,"I am thankful in the extreme that the manufacturers of antiperspirant have come up with OTC clinical strength for those of us who have lived their entire lives until now with embarassingly sweaty armpits.  I don\'t even stink of sweat, I just sweat out of my underarms alot.  Once a coworker even commented on it at my shirt and tie client facing job, recommending I change the brand of antiperspirant I use--but it wasn\'t like I didn\'t know I had this problem so it wasn\'t any more embarassing than the problem itself, now solved by great products like this one.  This not only helps me personally, but professionally as well.So I\'ve been using Degree prescription strength antiperspirant for about a year and a half now, and when the opportunity came up to try out a sample of this Gillette version I merely thought it would save me ten dollars.  Instead, I will be buying this from now on.What\'s the difference?  The active ingredient is the same and in the same amount--so one is just as effective as the other--and they both have moisturizers and such so that they don\'t irritate my underarms.  But the applicators are different in design and I have to say Gillette wins on this aspect alone.DESIGN / APPLICATOR: On the Degree product, the place on the applicator where the cream comes out is about the size of a quarter, whereas on the Gillette version it\'s wide enough to cover my entire underarm so I don\'t have to do circles with it to make sure I applied completely.  I believe this also causes me to use less of it, which makes it last longer and therefore is a better value.COMFORT: I noticed that with the Gillette product they seem to have put something in it that gives me a nice cooling sensation when I apply it.  It\'s very subtle, and very nice.  Degree, nor any other antiperspirant I\'ve ever tried, doesn\'t seem to have this.  I also feel the Gillette product is more comfortable.EFFECTIVENESS: As I wrote above, literally no difference in effectiveness between the Degree and Gillette products.  Same active ingredient, in the same amount.SCENT: The Gillette product that I sampled--the one on this page--has so little scent to it that we could say it practically has none.  It smells like and about as strong as Aveno moisturizer.  The Dove product, for comparison, smells really good, but not so strong that people notice it when you\'re near them.  I like the Gillette scent, or lack thereof, better.BOTTOM LINE: I didn\'t think this sample would cause me to change clinical strength antiperspirant from the brand I\'ve been using for years, but it did.  You should definitely try both and decide for yourself which one you prefer, but for me the clear winner is Gillette.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have always liked the Gilette Mach3 blades but was not pleased with the cost compared to the number of times I could use it comfortably.  I finally discovered that I could save some money by having them automatically sent to me by Amazon.com every three months or so.  This certainly saved me some money over purchasing them in a three or four cartridge pack in the local stores. Now I never have to even think about buying more since Amazon keeps up with it and ships them to me automatically at a discounted price.  I think it is a great way to market a good product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It left my skin feeling smooth and it was easier to use because you cut out the step of having to lather up some shaving cream.Using it for the first time I shaved my legs quite faster then I would doing it the old-fashioned way. You do have to go over areas more than once, especially in using the razor for the first time because I noticed that it kind of grazed the area (probably because the bars are quite high compared to the razor part. I tried it also under my arms but it didn\'t get that area that well and I had to go over it again with a regular razor.

The razor works fine without the power feature which vibrates the blade.  At first, I liked the power feature and used it for about one week, but then I just found it a bit annoying and haven\'t used it since then.  The power feature actually slows you down a bit as you cant rush the blade over your stubble as I have become used to doing after a hot shower in the morning.  I can tell that using 5 blades gives me a slightly closer shave than my previous razor with 3 blades (the mach 3) but I honestly don\'t care about the slight difference.  Hence I have come to the conclusion that this is not much of an advance in shaving technology, in a strange way, it is actually a step backwards as the prices of blades have gone up without a real noticeable enhancement in my shave.  I am glad that they haven\'t stopped making my previous blades and will likely switch back to those after I have used up all of my fusion blades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Manual razors, especially disposable ones, are more effective for me, but with my skin as sensitive as it is, I\'m usually decorating my face with little bits of tissue when I\'m through.With this razor, I get the best of all worlds.  With 5 blades, it\'s hard to miss a spot, and it takes less time overall to get the job done.  The vibrating gives it an extra \'kick\' and makes the shave more effective.  The best part is that there is virtually no sign of irritation.For those who are having trouble using this razor against 2- or 3-day-old beards, just be patient and let the razor (and its vibrations) do the work.  Pull your skin so the part you\'re shaving is good and tight and the stubble is separated as much as possible.This razor gives me, by far, the closest shave ever, and with no irritation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.

Recently I found out they still make & sell the blades & razors on Amazon. Why pay all that money for the Fusion blades when a Trac 2 will do the same thing for alot less money? I use the Gillette Trac 2 Plus which give me a close shave with alot less skin irritation than the Fusion blades. Merkur also makes blades for the Trac 2 & in my opinion; they are sharper & have a plastic unclogger between the 2 blades but they cost more. I recently bought a Gillette G2 razor/ same as the original Trac 2 but made overseas for 12 bucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5802,2106,20100603,B003987CL0,5,"June 3, 2010",A16QODENBJVUI1,My favorite razor has been wonderfully improved,"I\'ve been using the Gillette Fusion ever since it first came out and have been an enthusiastic fan.  There are two things that I have always loved about it.  First, it gives an incredibly close shave.  Other razors cut reasonably close, the using the Fusion there are times when I can run my hand across my face and not detect even the tiniest bit of beard.  Nothing but smoothness.  The other thing that I love about the razor is that I have cut myself using it less than any brand of razor than I have ever used.  One might think that five blades might actually increase the chances of getting cut, but this isn\'t the case.There have been several minor design changes over the past few years.  They have all, however, been rather minor.  Until now, that is.  The new Proglide version of the Fusion is considerably different than the other versions.  The main improvement is that blade now tilts back much more sharply, allowing you to shave at many more angles.  I find that this allows a much better shave than before, especially around the nose.  It is just easier to use than before.  The other major change is that there is a heavier lubricant strip.  Frankly, I\'m not a big believer in lubricant strips.  They don\'t seem to me to aid much in shaving.  But if you think this matters, it is definitely true that the lubricant strip is heavier than on the old blades.So, if you haven\'t used the Fusion series, I definitely recommend doing so.  It is a great razor.  And if you have been using the Fusion, I would definitely recommend the upgrade to the new Fusion Proglide.  It is a great improvement to an already great razor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I definitely get closer shaves when using the power in addition to the 5 blades.  The power is nothing more than a small vibrator motor, like a cell phone, but it provides a closer shave because you end up applying more pressure with slower strokes.  I used to get 2 or 3 days out of the Mach 3 before it was semi-dull.  I can get about a week of close shaves and an additional week of not-so-close shaves out of the Fusion.Overall, the best razor I\'ve ever had.

Two words: Kick @ss!!! It smells fresh and clean, it doesn't stain your clothes and it lasts a REALLY looooooooong time. My only complaint is that every new dispenser is never filled completely. There is a lot of empty space at the top and you have to turn the dial quite a bit before the deodorant comes out. I always feel like I'm getting ripped off a little bit. Especially considering how expensive this stuff is. It's kind of lame. Other than that, awesome!

I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.

I\'ve been keeping a bald head for about 6 weeks now and this razor is a huge improvement from the twin. Several men\'s bald type websites had noted advantages with the 5 blade. Some say power, some say not. If I space it, and use the razor without the power- I notice it on cleanup for sure. My hair was thin on top so either way- that area is smooth.

I rate it 4 stars just because its not as wonderful as some of the other venus razors, but thats why its a bit cheaper. I knew that before I bought it. There is not much of a difference in the closeness of the shave but more so in shaving; the venus embrace has these moisture strips so after the first time (it takes time for the water to soak in) you don\'t even have to use shaving cream for the next several times till the moisture strips wears out. However, I am not sensitive when it comes to shaving and have no problem using shaving cream (hair conditioner) and the shave is almost as close as any other venus.

6291,2601,20060306,B004B8AZH0,1,"March 6, 2006",A1F9YNY2KTBO5H,Much Too Expensive,"I bought the Fusion manual razor and after using the two included cartridges and then seeing the cost of replacement cartridges, I have tossed my Fusion. Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense. I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline: we are being milked of every cent we are willing to part with.Another issue I\'m concerned about is that the clamshell packaging is dangerous if it is anything like the packaging used for Mach 3 cartridges. The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you. It is unsafe for most adults. The government ought to force Gillette to design safer packaging.The main reason for giving this product 1 star is the price. I\'m not willing to part with $22 to $28 for 8 shaving cartridges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
236,245,20050609,B0001LQGEM,5,"June 9, 2005",A2ERK85P6X5I6S,FINALLY! Something that works on my face!,"I have the worst possible combination for shaving: a thick beard and sensitive skin. Ingrown hairs and razor bumps were a weekly, if not daily occurance for me. I started off as a teenager with the original Sensor. When that got too painful I transitioned to the Sensor Excel. That served me well through my college years, where I could get away with shaving every 2 or 3 days. I found that my face needed a day or 2 off before I could shave comfortably again. When I entered the workforce, the president of my company noticed the stubble on my face during my \'off\' days and insisted that I shave every day. Well, after about a week of daily use with the Excel, my neck was about as raw and sore as it ever had been. That was about the time that Gillette introduced the Mach3. I transitioned to that, and eventually the Mach3 Turbo, but I was STILL getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps.I did some research and found that my technique (shaving against \'the grain\' without shaving with the grain first) was causing a great deal of my problems, so I started to change my ways with less than stellar results. The Mach3 was designed to be used \'against the grain\', and shaving in the direction of my hair growth produced almost no results at all. I couldn\'t even feel the razor cutting anything as I pulled it down along my face and neck. In addition, the added width of the blades made it nearly impossible to shave the areas underneath my nostrils. I had to keep my old Sensor handy to tackle that area when I was done with the rest of my face. My fiancee suggested spending $20 on the new battery-powered Mach3...no, thank you!Then I saw the Senor3, and decided to give it a try. The blades were cheaper than the Mach3 (even at Costco Warehouse prices), so it wasn\'t much of an investment for the experiment. All I have to say is, \'THANK GOODNESS!\' The Sensor3 has the best of both worlds between the Excel and the Mach3. The blades fit any Sensor handle, which is a more traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn\'t have to invest in a whole new system. It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it\'s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors AND I can get to the area under my nose. But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results. To the outside world I look clean-shaven every day, even though I can feel a tiny bit of stubble. That\'s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.I now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I\'m as smooth as a baby\'s backside. I\'ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort. The \'Art of Shaving\' products are a godsend. Invest in the Pre-Shave oil, trust me. I also went \'retro\' and picked up their shaving cream and brush. Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it\'s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route. I think I FINALLY found something that works for me after 15 years of shaving!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      </div>

Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o'clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It's worth the money.

6079,2387,20111121,B004A7PB26,2,"November 21, 2011",A2XVF87JLJ0RGC,Oily,This body wash by Gillette leaves a thick residue that makes the tub (where I shower) extremely slippery. I had to throw away the bottle because it was too dangerous. Let me point out that this has never happened to me before with any other body wash that I have tried. It has something to do with the \'thick lather\' technology that they advertise. Not recommended. Two stars because it smells fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6472,2787,20120428,B0062IWQVU,2,"April 28, 2012",A2OVHHKN3JZV8G,"Horrible, for my beard!","This is my lowest review thus far, on Amazon, and I stand behind it. I\'m giving it two stars because I guess it does some things OK, but it\'s really bad, at clipping without the combs. WHen I use it to trim, with one of the attached guides, it does OK. But when I use just the clipper, without the attachments, that damned thing keeps opening up.I have a thick beard, and trim it back until it\'s stubble - which I what I bought this unit for. But the damned thing will open up and pinch my face, about five times, every shave. To use it, I have to pinch down on the head so hard, that my index finger gets fatigued. This thing is garbage! Oh, and the battery does not last long, but I guess that\'s to be expected with AA.If you\'re using this to trim a beard with some height (eg. using one of the attached spacers), it does a reasonable job. But if you\'re looking to shave that beard down to stubble, as I do, look elsewhere. I can\'t believe more people haven\'t run into this issue! I regret the $20 I spent on it, and with Gillette put a fraction of their Marketing budget into R&D. Or maybe some of their execs should actually try using the B.S. products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A buddy let me smell his deodorant once and it smelled like a really good cologne.  Ever since (a couple of years later) I have been using and I order this particular type from online due to the fact that I can\'t find it anywhere else.

5755,2057,20100717,B003987CL0,4,"July 17, 2010",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,Great but Expensive,"First I\'ll note that I\'m a female, and not the target audience for this item, so I handed it over to my boyfriend to do the testing. He\'s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.His current razor is a Mach 3, so he did side by side comparisons between that one and this Fusion Proglide. He did the typical half-the-face test where he shaved each half with one of the razors. He did comparison tests where he tried it powered and non-powered.For all of these tests, the result - the shave closeness - was about the same. This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.As for the *process* of shaving. running the Fusion Proglide with the power off felt similar to using the Mach 3. However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \'pull\' - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  I\'ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.He was expecting the trimmer blade to be pretty useless - but it turns out it was pretty convenient for trimming. You can\'t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.He used it for a half dozen shaves, and the blade still has a little life left, which is on par with a Mach 3.For people who already have a Mach 3 and didn\'t care about the \'shaving process itself\', there\'s no real reason to change blades. People who are having issues with tugging and pulling might appreciate the smoother shaving experience with the Proglide.On the issue of blade cost, if you buy the Proglide blades in bulk, you can get blades closer to $3 a blade. Still, this can seem expensive compared with other options.In the end we\'re hoping when we run out of Mach 3 blades that the blades for this one might have dropped in price and we\'ll move over to the Proglide. However, but it\'s not like we\'d toss out the Mach 3 and the existing blades in order to use this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They just don\'t have the strength to give the strongest shave possible in a longer time. I just honestly wish that Gilette can make a much stronger razor blade for all their customers, especially for men whom want the simplest shave desired.

Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn\'t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough. The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin. This interference can also lead to nicks because it\'s difficult to gauge how much pressure to apply to get the razor to meet skin. The gel bars, the selling point of this product, are meant to be a substitute for soap or some other shaving gel. But if you tend to use soap anyway, they are superfluous.That said, this is a decent razor. Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I guess a good rule is don\'t throw down a lot of money thinking you are getting a really good deal. Avoid buying 40 or 80 counts because if you are wrong, then you are out a ton. Also, if you get screwed on Amazon make sure you go back to the exact page you bought from and hammer them. Let people know who the bad apples are.

        <b><span class=""h3color tiny"">This review is from: </span>Gillette Clinical Fresh Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)</b>
      </div>

I've had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I'm 42 now) I've found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.<br /><br />Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.<br /><br />I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it's simply a 'clean' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don't find it competing with my perfume and haven't noticed it to be overpowering.<br /><br />Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.<br /><br />The product isn't invisible and will get on your clothes if you're not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.<br /><br />I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can't find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about 'pitting out' my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.

The little rubbery fins seem to keep the head moving at a good pace with no problems so far.  It is flat and hugs the skin well and seems to rotate well without difficulty.I will keep using it and testing it, but I am not sure how expensive the replacement blades are- that is often the problem.  So many times the replacement blades are more expensive than the original razor or close to it.The handle was easy to hold on to despite soapy wet hands.  The wall unit  stayed up well so far on my fiberglass shower wall- it has two suction cups which seems a bit better than other ones I have tried with only one.The extra blade pack stores inside which I like, although it has to be cut into with scissors to get at it, so having it in the shower helps to keep track of it, but not for opening when needed.  You have to get out of the shower to open it.All in all I really like this razor so far- I have used it twice on my legs and it has stayed sharp and effective, but I will edit if I can in the future to reflect any changes in my opinion of this as time goes on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My husband used this deodorant and found the smell not unpleasant, but a little bit stronger than his usual (he normally uses Mennen Speed Stick). It did not leave any streaks or staining on the shirt and lasted him the day. Though the Amazon Title given this product says \'Deodorant\' the item itself is labeled as an Antiperspirant/Deodorant and it does its job fairly well under normal \'office\' circumstances. Not sure how it would hold up under more physical situation or extreme heat.

183,191,20040127,B000065AB0,4,"January 27, 2004",A17B1BHRGORDTP,Spend more money in research -- less in advertising,"I\'ve been suckered into the Gillette series since Sensor then Sensor Excel unto MACH3 and then the Turbo.  Each new iteration of this series promises an even closer shave than the previous one.  I now own two MACH3 Turbo razors (given as gifts), but am less than satisfied with the product.When the blades are new, the shave is great, but they don\'t last that long.  Don\'t even think about buying blades and storing them -- at least they don\'t work that well in the tropics.  I\'ve found the conditioning strips began melting on my unused blades and sometimes even causing rust on the blade.  My experience with this razor is bittersweet, it is probably the best razor on the market but cost of blades will do you in quickly.I can\'t wait for the next iteration of this series, although by then I might move on to an electric shaver.  Basically don\'t believe the advertising -- a shave that close will probably only happen once with a fresh blade, and if you have thick hair it may also give you a little nick to get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can get a 4th week and usually do, however notice it getting dull and harder to shave.The power does help, some people say it dont....maybe not a whole lot, but heck a battery will last me a year on this razor.Having sensitive skin, I cant get a super close shave and I am not looking for one.

5614,1915,20111225,B003983HZK,1,"December 25, 2011",A14BCNFXHTRJ13,Wish I had read the negative reviews,"Yes, I am a woman, and yes, I use men\'s razors. They work better, last longer, etc etc. However these blades are nothing like the Gillette blades I love. The lubricant strip that usually leaves my legs feeling silky smooth is nonexistent on these blades, and instead of a smooth close shave I have a rough \'morning after\' feel. Sadly I wasted about $25 because I trusted Amazon (this was sold through Amazon itself not a third party).The look of the packaging is very similar to regular Gillette packaging, and the look of the blades themselves are close, but the lubricant strip (while colored and appearing normal) does not work as it does on Gillette blades, and the blades themselves do not give a good close shave as Gillette blades do.Maybe I got a bad batch, but according to some of the other reviews it seems as if this is an ongoing issue, so maybe they are right and this is a counterfeit item. Either way, that\'s the last time I buy razor heads through Amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6196,2505,20090826,B004B8AZH0,5,"August 26, 2009",A35W3JQYP0M655,The Best......And The Best Place To Get \'Um,"I think just about anyone that gets around to trying the Gillette fusion finds it the best they have ever used.  I got mine as a Christmas Present 2 years ago.  It took me just over 4 months to use the three cartridges that came with it.  There is no downside.  It was both the best shave, as well as the most economical one I had ever experienced.  I admit that I was a little taken back by the cost when I finally ventured out in the spring to buy some replacements.  Around here they either lock them away in some little Fort Knox in the store, or even enclose them in security boxes that sound an alarm if you try to open it or run out the door.  I can only imagine that too many men, (and some women too) have considered larceny over cheaper blades if they can\'t afford the fusions.  The fusion cartridges may be a little steep, but the truth is 8 of them in a pack can easily get your average Joe through an entire year of shaving. Here on Amazon, I got 8 refills for $20 and free shipping!  That\'s not only a good $5.00 cheaper than the best place here, but that\'s not including the savings on the sales tax.  Believe me when I tell you that I spent over an hour one night searching for replacement blades online and finally settled on Amazon as unbeatable.  Nobody even came close with the free shipping.  If you\'re not already a Gillette fusion shaver, become one.  If you are, buy the cartridges here.  Amazon not only has the best price for them but it is actually easier and more convenient to buy here.  You will never be tempted to resort to larceny....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
