518,538,20080713,B000BUUVTE,3,"July 13, 2008",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,"Over-priced, Over-bladed","The Gillette Fusion is Gillette\'s latest (as of this writing) offering to the world of manual shaving. Featuring five blades and a stunning new razor design, the Fusion is a truly attractive razor. But is it \'the best a man can get\'? Not for this man.Aesthetics: 4 stars. The Fusion design is truly excellent and far superior to other razors. The handle has been greatly extended compared to the Mach 3 handle, and a noticeable amount of weight and girth has been added as well. This is a razor that will feel comfortable in almost any man\'s hand. The blade cartridge itself keeps this razor from getting 5 stars in my opinion. Fusion cartridges are about the same size as cartridges for the average razor for women. This will require many men to slightly alter the way they shave their faces; however, the one-blade trimmer (on top of the razor) helps a good bit.The shave: a disappointing 3 stars. The Fusion gave me an incredibly close shave. I mean incredibly close. My face hasn\'t been that smooth since I was a child. I thought the trimmer worked well for its purpose. But -- and this is a big \'but\' -- the shave was honestly too close for comfort. After every shave with the Fusion, my face felt extremely sensitive for the rest of the day. I cannot help but believe that the 5-blade design caused the discomfort that I felt after using the Fusion. Perhaps other men will not have this issue. For those with sensitive skin (like me), your best bet might be to avoid the Fusion.Blade durability: 4 stars. This was where the Fusion blades really shined. With most razors, I typically have to change blades once a week. With the Fusion, I used the same blade for 2 weeks with no trouble at all. The blade still felt fresh after a week, and drag was minimal into the second week.Overall: The razor was decent. Certainly an impressive shave, but perhaps too close for some due to the unneccesary number of blades. The biggest problem with the Fusion is that the blades are insanely expensive. In my opinion, the cost of Fusion blades diminishes everything else that might be good about it.UPDATE: Decided to give the Fusion another shot by buying an entirely new system with a new blade. Still an incredibly disappointing razor with lots of irritation. It\'s just one or two blades too many. I cannot say the shave is any closer than a Schick Quattro or even a Gillette Sensor Excel on a good day. Would be nice to see Gillette take this razor design, with the longer handle and closer blade spacing, and port it over to a 3-blade.    "

I have been using Gillette sensor-series products almost exclusively since the Gillette sensor debuted in 1990.I graduated from Sensor, To Sensor II, to Mach 3, to Mach 3 power.I normally shave wet, with no shaving cream, and with down strokes, although I use some upstrokes. I have tested the Mach 5 both wet and dry, with no cuts or major problems.I have used the Gillette Fusion for 1 week, and here are my findings.Pluses:1) An overall great shave.2) The Fusion shaves better dry than any previous Sensor model. (Although I rarely have a reason to shave dry).3) More blades. More microfins!4) The plastic handle, while bulky, is very nice. The plastic is gentle to the touch, aa nice departure from the rigid, cold metal of the M3.5) Comes with a coupon for $2 off additional cartridges.Minuses:1) The confort strip wear out WAY too quickly.  My Mach3 blades last 3 weeks, My Fusion blade needs replacement after 1 week. Hopefully, the replacement blades will be better than the original ones (if so, I\'ll edit this review).2) Since there are more microfins with a larger area, and sincen the microfins become more imporant to the overall shave, the microfins trap more hairs than ever. Even washing the blade doesn\'t get rid of all of the microhairs trapped in the microfins.3) The 5 blades make upstrokes more difficult and don\'t offer the precision of the M3 and previous models for the tough spots (e.g. under the nose). On the soft ares of the face (e.g., the cheecks), the larger footprint makes it harder to press close and cut hairs close to the skin. However, this problem is somewhat offset by the additional blades and microfins.4) As always, the blades are more expensive than previous version. At this rate of inflation, Gillette blades will cost $50 each by the year 2030. =)Overall, it is a great product. I am undecided if I will keep using Fusion or switch back to the M3 as my primary. I might use both together (as I previously did with the M3 and Sensor Excel).    "

I need to shave everyday because I am in the Army and I have always used Gillette Fusion.  The ProGlide often doesn\'t get a close enough shave and is easier to miss spots.  I\'ve been using the razors for 2 weeks and I have cut myself three times.  I never had the same problems with the older version of Gillette\'s Fusion.  I threw these blades away because they are so bad, what a waste of money.    "

The power version has a slight advantage in giving a quicker and *slightly* closer shave but if it came down to huge differences in price, for my purpose of shaving legs I could easily go either way.This razor does do an excellent job at getting a close shave and in my experience I find that razors designed for women have not worked any better than this.The only quibble I have is with what I feel is extremely high prices for the refill blades.

However, there is a lot of plastic (the moisture ribbon) around the razors, which slows down the shaving process. I also found that this product left my underarms and bikini line very irritated so, it is not the best for sensitive areas. A big negative though is that this is a very pricy razor. 12.00 for the original, and 3.00 for each replacment cartridge. Overall, it is not worth your money.    "

It is suggested by the manufacturer that you change blades when the blue strip is gone. If I follow this guideline, I end up changing blades about ten times a month.

But for a long time, I was using the Mach 3 but I had a lot of issues with it.  I have very sensitive skin in my mustache area so I always had a problem with cuts or it would tug at my facial hears and cause pain.  So much so that I switched to electric razor for the past 5 years.  But with electric, it was frustrating because I could never get the satisfying shave a blade can get me.After seeing all the advertisements for the Proglide I couldn\'t resist so I decided to try it out.  I put on some shaving cream and tried this bad boy out and it sent chills up my spine as I glided this thing across my sides and chin.  I even went against the grain and it was just so smooth.  Now for the ultimate test.... I grimaced as I anticipated pain as I was about to shave my mustache area and I couldn\'t believe how it just cut away at all my hairs.

I used it for the first time yesterday and can\'t say I find it all that superior.  I did feel it left a smooth shave, but so does the Divine (3 blade version).  The handle felt no different as well, which is apparently one of the selling points to the Embrace since the handle has a bit of cushion and non-skid material.  The blade itself is fairly bulky, and can totally understand the concerns over it\'s size for more delicate areas with curves being more difficult to maneuver around.  The 5 blades are so closely stacked that it clogs quickly if you have more than 1 day of stubble to take care of.My biggest concern with this razor was that it had drag.  The blade cartridge has some \'special\' moisture strips or whatever they are meant to be that just grate over my skin.  It kept making me nervous that I was creating nicks up my legs!  I do have very sensitive skin, so perhaps this is why I didn\'t like the sensation of the actual cartridge, but I wouldn\'t imagine a well lathered leg (with Gillette\'s own shaving cream!) would create such a noxious scratchy drag.But, all this said, the razor gets the job done.  Once I use up the two cartridges/blades that comes with this razor, I will attach the Divine blades to it- which is a good selling point to have a razor that has the capacity to use all of the Venus blades.

You can do the math, but $400/year for blades is more than I can stomach. I can well afford it, but somewhere you have to put a line in the sand and say, enough.

That leads me to believe that with 5 blades, it\'s still not a close shave.I also felt the razor head was surrounded on all four sides with way too much plastic; making the shaving of more delicate areas, bikini line, etc, a little more challenging.  I felt I was doing some serious contorting in the shower this morning, and felt if I could have removed some of the bulky plastic, I would have been much better off.I did like the shower case that suctioned to the shower wall, I liked that a lot.

This has solved my problem of where to keep my razor. Before it was in the soap dish which really didn\'t work.I also love that the blades are replaceable. It makes this a little more earth friendly because you just need to change the blade and not throw away the whole razor. The ShowerPod also holds extra razor cartridges which I found to be another great feature.I have to say it really does give you a close shave. There are five blades and they\'re very close together so if you\'re using too much shaving cream the razor won\'t work too well, but once you use a little less this razor delivers and gives you a close and smooth shave.

They were OK, but you have to really look closely at your face in good light to see that spots were missed, especially the chin. They don\'t flex and adjust to the surface of your face. If you\'re careful and take your time, you can get a pretty close shave with them, but when you are rushing in the morning to get your family out the door - on time for school and work - quick is the word.I opened a free sample that Gillette had sent me some 3 years ago, tried it, and fell in love. It was the best shave - no irritation - even against the grain, which I never did with the other systems for fear of razor bumps. I was truly impressed!Now I\'m looking for a good bargain on refills. After reading some of these critical but helpful reviews, I will definitely buy from a store. I really like them even if they are pricey. Going to have to work this cost thing out.

It really has cut the time...It is scary cause it feels like the blades are sticking to your skin, yet the whole shave is surpisingly smooth.  I was able to shave under my nose and under my lips, and not a single cut, or even the sense that I\'d be cut.It really made short work of my face... Which I personally only shave once or twice a week.  So my hair does grow over the week.Surpisingly not once did I have to actually Clean the blades, or try really hard to get the gunk out.  Everything just seemed to clean just fine under the water.However this is the reason I am giving it a 4 stars rather then a 5 stars (but seriously is there such a thing as the perfect razor in the first place?).

It is by far the best cartridge system on the market.  The slim head is much more manageable than the oversized wall of blades of the Mach 3 (which feels like you are just wiping your face with blades, instead of using a razor).  That little area under your nose is reason enough to avoid the Mach 3. Tell Gillette to quit pushing its Mach 3, and to make the Sensor 3 more widely available (though you can still find it at Amazon).    "

Not only is it the cheapest razor from the Gilette Venus line,  but it also leaves my legs silky smooth. In order to achieve the most silkiest feeling legs i rub body butter on my legs after the shave/shower.The razor itself is great. It is really hard to  cut yourself, unless you go up or down with the razor sideways-- this will result in a clean cut, but it will be deep and will bleed.  Leaving the razor in the shower/bath will make it rust/dull faster due to the moisture so make sure to wipe off the razor after your shower and store it away (even if it is in a drawer) it will prolong the cartridges life. Also when it dulls it will leave your legs not that smooth and with little stubble -- so don\'t forge to change those cartridges.This box does not come with a razor, it is just the cartridges and each cartridge is individually packed. It is simple to replace the cartridges on the razor, just pop off the old cartridge, open the new cartridge packet, and pop the razor into the new cartridge. Done.    "

All types of mach 3\'s produce an equal shave which is at the same time, close and the blades clean out well under a hot tap. but the overriding factor that made me come back to them was the 7 variaties of handle to choose from, so now i can have a different razor for every day of the week which overall makes shaving everyday more tolerable. i dont personally believe in the micro-pulses of the m3 power but the vibrations themselves must enhance the the performance somehow. if your thinking of buying one of the mach 3\'s then go for it, as you won\'t be dissapointed.

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

I love that they fit on any Venus razor; although, they best match the Divine handle because of the blue text on the blade. They\'re rounded so there\'s no sharp edges. However, they can sometimes be bulky when it comes to feminine curves. Because there are no wires over the blades, the Venus Divine razor is quite easy to rinse off. It doesn\'t have as many nooks and crannies which attract hair, soap or cream like the Quattro blades.Overall, I love the Divine razors. I always get a great shave on my legs and underarms. Those areas don\'t require any shaving cream with Divine\'s multiple moisture strips. I rarely cut myself and irritation around the bikini line and intimate areas is minimal when used with a good shaving cream. The comfort coated blades glide quite smoothly over the skin without catching or scraping, with help from the smoothing cushions. I believe both of those features are only on the Divine razor blades, not the regular Venus blades.The moisture strips add moisture you can touch to the blades (much more-so than the original Venus blades); although, it can feel a bit slimy if you leave it in the shower (the slimyness and moisture both fade over time). The moisture strips are supposed to fade when it\'s time to refill but I\'ve honestly never noticed it so I just replace when I feel like I am not getting an awesome shave anymore.    "

I loved it and kept it sharp by rubbing the blade with an alcohol prep pad and storing it *outside* the bathroom to make it last longer. It worked, too!I always buy a pack of cheap disposables for summer travel: to my parents\' house, to his parents\' house, on vacation, everywhere. I ran out of the Schick Quattro disposables so I figured I\'d try something new. My brother\'s girlfriend is half Mexican so she has SUPER thick hair - she told me to try the Custom Plus Pivots out.Wow. What a razor! For 1/3 or 1/2 the cost of a Mach 3 blade you get an ultra sharp, durable and long lasting razor. The moisturizing strip is HUGE!I can\'t believe these are so great. I will say that for bikini line usage I still slightly prefer the Mach 3 because it can pivot more than these do. These are great for legs, armpits and face.Overall a steal!    "

Tried it and got the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had. I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.That sample Fusion blade lasted about 3 months (I kid you not) and I do have a heavy beard. Wow, I thought. These blades are expensive, but if I didn\'t have to change them as often, it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills. The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.I purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out. What the heck? After about a week the replacement blade was dull. I went through the 4 pack in about a month and bought a second pack at another retailer. Same thing. One week=1 blade.Gillette must really think we\'re stupid. Give the suckers a free sample that\'s great and make them pay for crummy blades after they\'ve committed to the system. Never again, Gillette.....I just ordered a Braun cordless from Amazon so you can just go pick someones else\'s pocket.Edited: Any suckers our there still letting Gillette rip them off? Yeah, I guess so since they\'re still in business. The Braun electric I mention above has recently been relegated to backup status to my Merkur double edge razor. Yep, one of those things like my dad used and that I learned to shave with. Blades cost about 7 cents each in bulk and last about a week.

The packaging is very attractive, green with seafoam blue as is the color of the razor itself. One positive aspect of the Gillette products is that you can actually get into the product through the packaging without spending ten minute tyring to cut into the plastic. There is a perforated entrance in the back of the package that opens easily. This razor comes with a cute little round receptacle that holds the razor and attaches to the shower head.  All of this makes the razor attractive but the real test is whether the razor works well. The Venus Embrace has 5 shaver heads and gives the smoothest shave I have experienced.  I would buy this razor again in a heartbeat. There is a protective ribbon of moisture that provides a smooth glide. This makes the razor an A+ item in my opinion.Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-07-08    "

I didn\'t know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too.  Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!).  I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I\'ve used in the past.  However, as other reviewers have noted, it\'s not as \'rich\' or full-bodied when it comes out of the can.  The \'instructions\' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams).  Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it\'s good foam, and I\'d give it a higher rating if it wasn\'t for the \'watery\' consistency when it comes out of the can.  This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).In summary:* If you like foam, you may like this one.  3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won\'t like it.  However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you\'d like it.    "

In this case, though, I really wasn\'t a big fan.  Simply, I didn\'t find the product all that effective --  I would sweat right through it, where I wouldn\'t with other similar products.  I also found the smell a little too strong at times.  I like the anti- perspirants / deodorant combo, but in this case I found the anti- perspirants a little less effective than I needed, and the deodorant a little more than I wanted.I also found that this product leaves a weird film, which doesn\'t easily wash off.  I regularly find in the shower that it\'s still slick / hair matted from where I applied the product previously.  Not particularly cool.  Many (but not all) other products like this don\'t leave this sort of residue, or at least not as much as this one does.  My 2-cents at least.One nice thing about this product I definitely noticed -- they give you a fair sized stick of it.  I hate spending $3-4 on a stick of this stuff and running out shortly after.  In this case, I think the product would last a little longer than average.  Nice work Gillette.In the end, I don\'t think I will be purchasing this product again.

I\'m serious people, you will not be disappointed with this razor.You can say goodbye to cuts and razor bumps with the Proglide Fusion. If you have a problem with razor bumps like I did, here are some tips:1. For the best results, don\'t shave for a week before the first time you use the Proglide Fusion. This will allow for many of your razor bumps to heal.2. Shave in a hot shower. This will open up your pores and make shaving easier.3. Don\'t press the razor hard to your face/neck. Use gentle short swipes as the super thin blades do not require you to gash your face in order to get a close shave.You should also note that this razor has a single blade trimmer on the back side for areas that require precision such as side burns and under the nose.The refills may be expensive, but they are worth it.

This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90% of the replacement blades, I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop (presumably glue) all over the blade, with the single blade missing! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems, as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet, and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality. I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke, but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades, I think it\'s time to call a spade a spade. I shave my head and my face both, and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors, and even with a fresh blade, many times it feels as though I\'m shaving my face/head with a sharp rock. needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase.

When purchasing this deodorant I used to spent over $6 a piece, with this great deal on Amazon. I buy in bulk and get more for my money. Some times I save up to 45% in the long run.    "

I loved that it came with a replacement head and that it had a storage rack with suction cups, so it could be placed out of the reach of children.  The razor itself had a great \'soft\' grip and a nice wide moisture strip.  But...... the Cons --The wide \'face\' on this razor kept it from delivering a close shave even though there were 5 blades.  When I used it on my legs I found that it didn\'t get REALLY close, although it was very maneuverable.  When my husband tried it, he found the same thing, plus the wide head meant that it really couldn\'t be easily used as a man\'s razor because there were places it just wouldn\'t go-- like under the nose.Still... the Pros --Where this razor absolutely excelled was the \'nick\' test.  I found that no matter how fast I shaved my legs I never came close to cutting myself, even around the knee.  In fact, I am so impressed with this razor that I called my sister to recommend that she get it for my nieces who are just getting to the age where they will soon be shaving.I think this is an ideal razor for shaving newbies.Pam T~    "

The scent is so light as to be almost nonexistent so it would probably work well for people with allergies. It does do a good job of controlling wetness and odor but in my opinion is just a little to expensive hence the four stars instead of five.  Also if you\'re having problems with wetness when applying the product that just means that you\'re using to much.

It\'s the law of diminishing returns.  Having one blade is much better than no blade at all.  Dual blade shavers are a little better than a one blade razor. Adding any more blades after that just is not worth it.  It just doesn\'t make sense how expensive these refills are.  I recommend you do not buy these expensive razors but instead opt for cheaper disposable dual-head razors.  I thought the disposable razors might do a worse job than blades like these or ones with four blades but they are just as good as those blades.

Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn\'t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough. The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin. This interference can also lead to nicks because it\'s difficult to gauge how much pressure to apply to get the razor to meet skin. The gel bars, the selling point of this product, are meant to be a substitute for soap or some other shaving gel. But if you tend to use soap anyway, they are superfluous.That said, this is a decent razor. Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.    "

Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense. I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline: we are being milked of every cent we are willing to part with.Another issue I\'m concerned about is that the clamshell packaging is dangerous if it is anything like the packaging used for Mach 3 cartridges. The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you. It is unsafe for most adults. The government ought to force Gillette to design safer packaging.The main reason for giving this product 1 star is the price. I\'m not willing to part with $22 to $28 for 8 shaving cartridges.    "

I need a deodorant that will go on dry and comfortable, but one that will also go on clear, and not stain darker clothing.With their Clear Shield line, Gillette does just that.To put it simply, Gillette\'s product gets the job done. It goes on dry and clear, and gives long-lasting odor protection that lasts all day. I put this on every morning before work, and several hours later when I get home, it\'s still working for me.If there\'s one negative (and from what I can tell, other reviewers will back me up on this), it\'s that the scent is a bit too \'sweet.\' It\'s almost as if Gillette was trying to create a product men and women alike could comfortably use - and in that aspect, the end result is questionable. They really need to get more scents out, and specific ones for men and women, not one that\'s just a compromise.Negatives considered, this is still a top-notch product.

When I finally spotted it, I imediately purchased it, took it home and tried it.  So, does this razor live up to the hype?When I came home and took the razor out of the package I was glad to see that the battery (1-AAA battery) was included but I was a little put off that it only came with one razor cartridge.  I figured from past experience that there would be two but only one???  The razor itself has a decent weight and a nice shape so I quickly got over the fact that there was only one cartridge.I brought the razor in the shower, washed my face and applied my shaving gel and was preparred to be wowed.  I turned the razor on and it came to life with a solid hum.  The power button on it seems to be better than the M3Power\'s because it protrudes a little less and it seems less likely to be accidently turned off while you\'re shaving.  That being said, I began to shave.  The first thing I noticed about the razor was the size of it\'s head.  It seems rather large in comparison to the M3Power or even the Schick Quattro blades.  Even though it did seem bigger, it didn\'t seem awkwardky big and I was still able to shave without it being cumbersome.  The razor cut clean and smoothly though my beard and gave quite a comfortable shave.  The blades easily rinsed under running water even though they are spaced quite closely to each other.  I noticed on a few of my problem spots I still had to take multiple passes with the razor so in spite of having five blades, it couldn\'t perform miracles!  There was the single trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge too but it really didn\'t seem to be very functional.Overall I was quite satisfied with the quality and comfort of the shave.  The question that I have now is that, in spite of a good shave, is this razor worth the extra price versus say, the M3Power or the Schick Quattro?  Locally the refils go for about 30% more than the other \'older\' razors so, there is a signifigant price difference?Personally, I\'ll continue to use this razor for a little while and look for the cartridges to be on sale but I honestly don\'t think the Fusion\'s shave is that far superior to either the M3Power or the Schick Quattro to justify paying that much extra.

Criticisms:1. Five blades are ridiculously wide.  It\'s hard to accurately shave the narrow area between my lip and nose.  Using these to square-up my sideburns is like using an axe.2. The proximity of the blades to each other causes rapid build-up of shavings, requiring more frequent rinsing. You pretty much have to rinse the head after each row. Very tedious.3. Even this bloodthirsty capitalist grows weary of Gillette\'s program of forced obsolescence.  I was perfectly happy with the Mach 3 system; now you can\'t even find the blades.  Before that it was Sensor; Atra; ad infinitum.  Does the human face keep changing?  Maybe in another million years. But until then, Gillette can stick it.    "

Wow!!The head of the razor is bigger than I\'m used to, but the only time this really makes a difference is when shaving my armpits.  (Did I really just mention my armpits in one of my reviews!?!)Because of how soft this shave really is - I decided to test it against my usual razor.  I shaved one leg with each razor.  Both were smooth and both grew back at the same rate.  If there\'s no difference - why wouldn\'t you choose the SOFT shave!!!  Seriously - I don\'t feel those blades - this makes me excited for swimsuit season ...

The wet shaving methods and products are far superior to other shaving mechanisms, but the time it took to safely use a double edge razor took up 25 minutes of my morning for a three pass shave avoiding major nicks along the way.  Using the Proglide I can confidently shave at a pace that is about 4 times faster without nick concerns.  The floating blades so effectively follow the contours of my skin that I get as close as shave as I ever have before.  The benefit of the power micro-vibrating effect is the blade cuts while it \'floats\' over the skin.  It is a great combination to safely cut against the grain in places where I dared not take my double edge razor.  Total time for a wet shave with three passes was about 10 minutes and this was the first time I\'ve used it.  I would expect it to be about 5-7 minutes next time.In defense of double edges, they still remain the best performance/price ratio of any disposable razor.    "

The turning point for me was, when the battery eventually leaked and corroded the internals (handle grip).  Tried the cheap (U$70) Philips battery operated travel-shaver for 6 months.  Unfortunately, I still missed the close-shaves from the blade shavers.  Finally, I took the plunge again - this time the Fusion Proglide Power.I have since been getting good results from it.  Maybe it is just psychology, but I feel that it had a closer shave compared to the Mac3 Power.  So far, after weeks of daily usage, I have not had a blade-change yet.  What I like was the flip over edge, to get a closer cut especially under the nose area, and below the lower lips.On another note, it did not shave too well when I use it with the Fusion HydraGel Moisturizing Shaving Gel.  Perhaps the Gel is too thick and the blades are floating rather than getting closer to the skin.Overall, it was a good investment for now.    "

The blades do last a long time for me, so the cost is really not an issue.Having five blades and the power mode really makes for a smooth, comfortable shave, but I really do not notice that much difference from my Mach3.

After some experimentation I came to the conclusion that something like a sensor two-blade razor was basically as effective as other more expensive options with three or four blades on them. This cost savings is further multiplied by the fact that, in order to fit more blades on those other razors, the blades are made much thinner and are more prone to wearing out. So a sensor blade like these are much cheaper and seem to last longer.

It seems much harder to shave with and pulls at my face more. This is coming from someone who loves the mach 3 in its various forms. I\'m not sure what the problem is. Maybe the blades are too close to each other or something. Maybe trying to cut so many hairs at once is a bad idea. All I know for sure is it\'s not smooth.  It\'s not just a slight difference either. I go back to the mach 3 which I still have and I immediately notice the difference. Maybe others with different beards will have better luck but for me this razor down right sucks. I\'ve given it a fair shake too. I\'m still trying to use up the blades I stupidly bought.  However I can\'t ignore the fact it is far worse.Edit: I want to add one more thing. Whey you first put a new cartage in the razor does a pretty good job. If you tested it for one shave you might think it was good. However it really degrades very quickly. The second day it\'s noticeably worse and it just goes down hill fast after that. Again I am comparing this to a Mach 3 which I can keep for a much (and I mean MUCH) longer time and have it shave pretty good.  There is definitely some technical problem with this razor and I think a lot of people posting good results have a) tested it once b) are shills for Gillette c)  are in denial after spending a lot of cash on it or d) have a beard like a baby\'s butt.

So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.  Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave.  However, both razors seemed to give the same shave in terms of closeness.  To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days and there was no appreciable difference.I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.  The battery power works in the shower, so that\'s a nice convenience.  Naturally, with a battery, there\'s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3.  Since my old razor never bothered me, I won\'t be switching to these more expensive blades.  But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.    "

I upgraded to the Gillette Mach3 when it came out, and I was pretty happy with the results.  Now, after a year of using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide, I\'m going back to the Mach3.The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide does provide a close shave.  It\'s the closest I\'ve ever had, to be honest.  The problem is that the blades get too dull to use within a week.  Oh, I could still use them, but then I\'d be tugging at hair instead of cutting through the hair.  My Mach3\'s cartridges would last three months before hitting the waste basket.  And the vibrating mechanism doesn\'t do a lick of good, either.  I have had just as good of results when leaving the battery powered vibrator off.Now, if I could afford to spend $100 a year on razor cartridges, I would stick with the Pro Glide.

476,486,20060211,B000BUUVTE,5,"February 11, 2006",A1OAN01CO11VIX,Best Razor Design,"I moved from a SensorExcel (2 blades) to this and this one is much better.I had a full face of hair (I hadn\'t shaved in about 4-5 days), enough to start a beard. One slow stroke across each section of skin with this razor was enough to clear out the hair with more precision than the SensorExcel could after 3 or 4 strokes.That is: a *new* SensorExcel blade in the same situation (4-5 days worth of hair) did worse and resulted in at least 3 cuts on average (whereas this blade resulted in no cuts). So clearly the new design helps. It does exactly what the ad says: spreads out the pressure of the cutting edges to reduce (eliminate in my case) the effect of your skin wrapping around the blade and causing cuts.But I believe you must use this blade SLOWLY. If you have the full face of hair like I did, that would be about 2 square inches per stroke, then wash. You can look into the blade and see very easily how full it is because with all those blades stacked so tightly together all the hair stays on the surface.This makes it easy to clean, too. Just run your thumb down the blades and you will easily unclog them. Compare this to the SensorExcel: once hairs were stuck in the abyss, they were usually there for good, requiring frequent blade changes. Hopefully this means the expensive blades will last longer (and thus prove to be worth the expense).This razor *is* an example of improvement via technology. I cannot agree that it is *revolutionary* but it is a good idea and it *is* the best razor design (I\'m comparing to double and triple razor designs, which I have used in the past). So it isn\'t the best on a revolutionary scale but it is the best.This razor\'s product execution was also an example of ridiculous marketing strategies gone over the top and if you want a laugh (or to be offended by the sheer obfuscation of information via distracting animations, interface, and sexual innuendo), I suggest checking out its website. The company could have made a greater profit had they foregone the ridiculously over-interfaced website because I doubt it convinced anyone. My first thought on entering was \'do I have to defeat the first boss before I can see their explanation for why a Power version of my razor is better?\' Along with the handle and cradle design, I would call it one of the most absurd and gaudy product executions I\'ve ever seen.However, the company luckily stumbled upon the best razor design in the process.

I\'ve been using Mach-3 blades for a some time with mediocre results -- maybe because I haven\'t been shaving every day -- so I wanted to switch to something better and cheaper.  Atra blades are much less expensive than most other blades (e.g., Fusion), but it just doesn\'t work for me... and I think I may know why: my shaving technique sucks.The angle of the blade when shaving is very important.  The pivot point of the Atra is in the middle of the blade, which acts like a seesaw fulcrum: if you have the right pressure but a slightly wrong angle, the Atra will pivot to a more correct angle and shave well; if you have the wrong pressure but a good angle, it may result in irritation; and if both your pressure and angle are bad (like me), then it may result in irritation with nicks and cuts (and razor burn).Unlike the Atra, the pivot point of the Mach-3 is at the bottom of the blade: if the angle is wrong, then the Mach-3 will pivot to a better angle; if the pressure is a little too strong, the Mach-3\'s pivot will also correct for that; and if both the pressure and the angle are bad, then the Mach-3 may result in a good shave regardless of how much your shaving technique sucks.More blades may mean more irritation for people with sensitive skin, so Mach-3 is the highest I want to go.  If there is a (cheaper) two-blade razor with a bottom pivot, then I will try it.  I noticed similar irritation when I used the Sensor two-blade razor, and I think that the reason was due to the pivot point and my poor technique.  I really wanted to keep using the Atra because the price is much better, but it just didn\'t work for me.  If I ever learn good technique then I will start using a double-edge safety razor, but until then... it\'s Mach-3 for me.    "

My reference product was Mennen Speed Stick Antiperspirant Icy Blast. In my reviews I always try do some concrete data gathering, so for this test I compared performance under extra warm conditions and extra stress conditions. The extra clothing or heat induced perspiration was controlled 100% effectively by both products. Under stress situation (such as an important presentation), the Gillette Clinical Strength (GCS) did perform marginally better. I would estimate that a 2 by 2 inch \'wet spot\' with Mennen Speed Stick (MSS) was reduced to about a 1.5 by 1.5 inch spot with GCS, for a 40% better wetness control. Sorry for the graphical details.So I perspire more under stress than under heat. The instructions for GCS are elaborate, three clicks of the screw applied the night before, metered through a bunch of small holes (typical of gel antiperspirants). The fragrance is subtle and baby powder like. Interestingly enough on the ingredients list its referred to as a \'masking fragrance\'.Now for the analysis. The active ingredient in both products is Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex in MSS (or trichlorohydrex in GCS). They are both in the same antiperspirant family as far as any wikipedia or dermatology website explain. The MSS contains 15% active ingredient, while the GCS contains 20% active ingredient. So in summary one additional swipe with the non clinical product gives you as much protection as a \'clinical strength\' product. The clinical product contains 1.7 oz vs 2.7 oz (40% less) for regular and costs over twice as much. For basically same product??? So do the math, and apply one more swipe of your regular product. You will get the same protection at lower cost. Its not that the Gillette Clinical Strength is bad, but it pricing takes advantage of peoples self consciousness about sweating. It should only be 33% more expensive based on the concentration for equivalent weight.    "

I got mine as a Christmas Present 2 years ago.  It took me just over 4 months to use the three cartridges that came with it.  There is no downside.  It was both the best shave, as well as the most economical one I had ever experienced.  I admit that I was a little taken back by the cost when I finally ventured out in the spring to buy some replacements.  Around here they either lock them away in some little Fort Knox in the store, or even enclose them in security boxes that sound an alarm if you try to open it or run out the door.  I can only imagine that too many men, (and some women too) have considered larceny over cheaper blades if they can\'t afford the fusions.  The fusion cartridges may be a little steep, but the truth is 8 of them in a pack can easily get your average Joe through an entire year of shaving. Here on Amazon, I got 8 refills for $20 and free shipping!  That\'s not only a good $5.00 cheaper than the best place here, but that\'s not including the savings on the sales tax.  Believe me when I tell you that I spent over an hour one night searching for replacement blades online and finally settled on Amazon as unbeatable.  Nobody even came close with the free shipping.  If you\'re not already a Gillette fusion shaver, become one.  If you are, buy the cartridges here.  Amazon not only has the best price for them but it is actually easier and more convenient to buy here.  You will never be tempted to resort to larceny....    "

I was initially skeptical about the abundance of gadgets here - five(!) blades, a battery, a single \'trimming\' blade, lubri-strips, and who knows what else, but this thing really, really works.  I do not understand the purpose of the vibrating feature, but to my surprise it doesn\'t cut me to ribbons, and does indeed seem to have the effect of cutting closer.  There is no substitute for the right shave cream (I use a product called King of Shaves), but the lubricating strip on the Fusion adds quite a bit of \'slick\' on its own.  I have never had a closer shave, and cannot imagine one.  I have had professional straight razor shaves at that barber, and have come home to let the Fusion finish the job.  Yes, the razors are \'price of oil\' expensive, but I find that they last a loooooong time (maybe 2 weeks out of each?), and actually improve with use (they work better with a little seasoning).

I don\'t really think this is the smell of ice, artic or not, but it smells pretty good, somewhere between a slight floral, and citrus blend.After that it\'s just like the other sticks out there, the active ingredient in most, Aluminum Chlorohydrate, is a known drying agent, so it helps evaporate sweat before it has a chance to soak you.

The pod is cute, but I don\'t stick things to the walls - so my pod and extra cartridges are going into a drawer.The main event is the razor itself.  The gel handle is very comfortable and the razor feels well balanced in the hand.  The head is wider than usual - a good feature when shaving the legs, may be kind of dicey on the underarms.  Another nice feature is the moisture strip which increases the glide factor on the skin, although it doesn\'t entirely eliminate the need for shaving gel or foam.The razor head shaves close and doesn\'t nick - at least the first time you use it.  The actual blades are on the thin / flimsy side, so you\'ll be changing the cartridge with above average frequency.  I don\'t know that a five blade head shaves any better / closer / faster than three blades, or two, or even one - but a five blade head does seem to clog up up more and faster than the others.  You\'ll be interrupting your shave quite a bit for rinsing and tapping.In summary, there are lots of cute features - the pod, the gel handle, the extra wide head and moisture strip.  The five blade head looks impressive, but the blades are flimsy and clog up five times as fast as a single blade.  Three and a half stars.    "

This is the first product that works just as well.

858,884,20100803,B000MLNVU8,5,"August 3, 2010",A21Y32DKNWT0OP,absolutely impressed.,"I have used many razors over the years, including buying a few overpriced electric razors. Recently I asked my girlfriend to pick up some razors at the store \'not cheap ones please\' and boy was that a mistake. Anyway, I happened to be on Amazon already buying something so I looked at razors and decided on this one. I actually didn\'t know that it was a battery operated razor. I had used a Gillette razor before and it gave me a good shave. So when I got this one with the battery and stuff I was kinda skeptical but figured it would shave good without the vibrations so I didn\'t have to turn it on to shave if I didn\'t want to... I thought maybe it would just carve up my face like a Halloween pumpkin. The first time I used it I was very pleasantly surprised. I figured maybe it was just because it was a brand new blade, which always shave great the first time. I am here writing this review now because after a week and a half of using this thing with the same blade, it\'s still shaving closer than any shave I\'ve ever had before. Really. I have had close shaves before but could still feel where the hair would eventually come back again meaning it was close but like it was only cutting the hair even with the skin and this one seems to cut it even lower if that makes sense. I can\'t believe how smooth my face is. Truly smooth as a baby\'s butt. I have to actually take my time and pay attention now more than before, because if I miss a spot, I can really feel the difference. My girlfriend has really noticed the difference too... (don\'t tell her I said this but it\'s almost annoying how much she is touching and kissing my face now. lol)I didn\'t get any replacement blades with my original order, but I\'ve been looking at the local stores and all the prices have been twice what I see here on Amazon for replacement blades. The actual razor is about the same, but I laughed when I saw 4 replacement blades at Rite Aid for the same price I just bought 8 here on Amazon. I think I\'ll buy some more replacements to have on hand when I go traveling next month.I have no idea what the last reviewer is complaining about. This thing is great... and the extra blade for trimming sideburns is great, even helps me to get under my nose perfectly. I feel no danger of being cut. I really believe this is the most complete and closest shave I have ever had. Very satisfied. I will never use a disposable razor or an electric razor again.    "

I tried the Fusion razors and honestly could not believe the difference in the shave that I got.  Even with my other razors, I could still feel some stubble when I ran my hand against the grain after a shave.  I hardly, if ever, feel this with the Fusion razors!  I also noticed a big difference in that the Fusion razors seems to have much less pull when shaving long stubble.  GREAT product.  My only complaint about them is that they are significantly more expensive.    "

Always though it would be too much trouble, or I was going to hack myself up.  Well, the other day I saw the commercial for Gillette Fusion Proglide and it sparked my interest.  If it does what it says, I was finally ready.  I was tired of the electric razor, shaving my neck was always a difficult adventure, always had to pre-shave so that the hairs were not too long, or the electric would yank those hairs out!So I finally took the plunge, while out picking up a few things, I grabbed the Gillette Fusion Proglide, and took it home, hoping that it was as easy as it sounded.  Since shaving with a electric was a different animal, and I wasn\'t sure how to go about it, I checked out the Gillette site to find a nice video on pre-shaving rituals, and much more.So after dinner I went at it, this rookie prepped his skin and hairs, and foamed up with the gel that came with the razor.  I started slowly, and softly, and there was barely any feeling.  As I started to figure out how much pressure I could use, and what was the best direction to shave the parts of my face, it was a snap.The first shave took me as long as my electric, but I that\'s the first time rookie shave, it will, and did get easier as I went along.  It was sooooo easy to shave my neck, and absolutely no tugging, and didn\'t get a nick or cut.Being the first manual razor I\'d ever own, and being an absolute rookie at this, the Gillette Fusion Proglide was  the best shaving experience I\'d ever had, and I would recommend the razor to everyone!

Shaving does not make the blade wear out---rust does.  Leaving the blade wet will lead to micro-rust in a few days so figure out how to dry it after using and it will stay very sharp for months.

I\'ve progressed over the years from an electric razor to progressively a one blade, two blade, three blade, and now a five blade gillette - battery powered and otherwise. Have I ever noticed a major difference moving one to the next - not sure - but like many others of you I tend to buy the latest just to say that I have it.Shaving differences well truth be told the biggest revelation for me was when I switched from electric to the one blade gillette - I\'d used the electric for twenty years since the time when I had to shave in the first place. What a revelation! The electric took for ever and seemed to grind your beard down much like a power sander. By contrast the one blade hand gillette was quick clean and gave you the impression that you\'d actually had a shave in the first place.Since then I suppose I have detected minor improvements as I\'ve progressed from one blade to two and more etc. But the changes are only apparent initially and you soon just don\'t notice, and they are sure not as marked as the transition from electric to manual. It\'s a bit like the difference between an expensive bottle of wine and a slightly cheaper one, or a good hi fi system and a not quite so good hi fi system - the differences are suttle - but there sure must be a big difference between a one blade and a five blade gillette. The only \'primitive\' razor I\'ve tried recently is a disposable and it is sure streets ahead of that.Aside from the disposable I\'ve never gone back to a lesser (ie fewer blades) gillette to test the extent of the improvement - perhaps I should. Anyway it\'s a good, well presented, piece of marketing - and as I said like many of you I\'d rather have the five blade than many that went before.Oh and by the way I don\'t cut myself with the five blader as I have with previous fewer bladed models so there is something tangible! Perhaps that is a good pointer to a better razor.    "

I love having a disposable with the built-in moisturizing strips so that I don\'t have to carry shaving gel or rely on hotel soap or shampoo. I don\'t often like scented products -- I like to choose my own scents -- but the scent of the moisturizing strips/gel bars is subtle and unobtrusive. The Venus Breeze is lightweight and easy to use in the shower. Its handle is lightly textured and easy to hold and I had no problems with it slipping during use in the shower.

Admittedly, not the best practice, but its habit now for 20+ years and I\'m not changing.This is an excellent razor.  Shaves quick and clean, even \'against the grain\' on the sensitive areas like my upper lip.  No razor burn, not irritation.  The vibrating action of the blade really seems to help over the standard versions.  The non-vibrating blades, even the nicer ones, always leave razor burn if I shave against the grain, so I am forced to go with the grain even though it does not seem to be as close of a shave.  This blade allows me to shave the way I want to, without the irritation I get with other blades.Even has a cool blue light on the power button that lights up when its turned on, not sure what good its for as the razor vibrates so its hard to forget that its on, but its neat anyway.Blade refills are rather expensive, but that seems to be a fact of life now on all razors unless you choose to go with the one piece, single use type.I have used the same blade daily for about 2 weeks now, and it just started getting uncomfortable.

754,779,20080207,B000BUW8WM,1,"February 7, 2008",A29WWNOYAM96QB,A Real Dissappointment.,"Let me tell you first, I\'m a Gillette fan, I have been using Gillette razors for over 18 years, I was always excited when they released a new razor because every time it was better than the old one.So, possibly you wonder why I gave a 1-start poor rating to this product. I was excited to buy this new line of product, as being certain it would have been better than the previous line Mach 3 Turbo. Result a real disappointment. Here are the reasons from a Gillette fan you can trust:1. 5 razors don\'t work. Over the years for the sake of competition they made double blades, triple blades than it was not enough they released 5-bladed razors like this one. However, since they needed to put the blades closer to each other to fit 5 blades in a limited area of razor head, it simply didn\'t work. Let\'s continue,2. This product has very sharp blades but since 5-very sharp blades are located very close to each other it resulted very bad maneuverability. You simply cut yourself easily if you made a slight side movement while shaving.3. Blades are so sharp it doesn\'t allow you to focus on flat surfaces for a close shave. It just goes through and if you insisted on getting for a closer shave you will cut yourself.4. You might think I have a sensitive skin type, BUT believe me I don\'t. Believe it or not with a Mach 3 I never cut myself never, never. I have very thick and strong hair, I can\'t use a regular razor for shaving. Only and Only Gillette Mach 3 handles my facial hair but not this one.5. This product has engineering flaws which is resulted from competitive 5-blade which are put very closely together and you cannot handle this razor well even if you are a surgeon. I know because I\'m  very successful with using my hands because of my profession. But thanks to engineers who developed this I cut myself with this razor, for the first time.6. It\'s your choice whether or not you buy this product but I want to remind you that for the first time I\'m taking my time and writing a review for a razor, be careful it\'s a razor not a Gillette anymore.A final personal shaving tip: If you want your high quality razor blades last longer than usual, do not rinse them with hot or warm water while shaving. If you use cold water for rinsing blades, you will see them lasting sharp for a longer period of time.    "

Then when I got a older I disliked the fact I could never shave very close with those razors, leading to afternoon beard shadows. Plus, it was hard to do anything like trim a smart goatee or sideburns, not to mention the heads would wear out periodically, and were expensive to replace.Finally I moved to shaving cream and manual razors, and it was like graduating to the big leagues, or moving from an automatic transmission to a stick-shift. I felt more in control and got a much better shave that lasted all day. But with cheap razors I found I\'d end up with nicks and irritations no matter how carefully I shaved. I\'m the type of shaver who goes against the grain; otherwise, I\'d never get close enough (my beard grows pretty fast).I\'ve tried most of the hyped-up Gillette and Schick razors over the years, and while they were a definite improvement over the throwaway kind, they were never all they were cracked up to be - I just figured razor technology had gone about as far as it could go, and adding more blades or a gimmick like battery power were just oneupmanship between the two major brands to win market share.That is, until I decided to give this Fusion Proglide Power a shot. I should say right up front, I\'ve not used the non-power version, so I can\'t comment on whether the vibration is a gimmick or does something useful. But I will say I haven\'t had a better shave except from a barber! The basic razor (and especially the starter kit) are not expensive, for what they are. The \'hidden\' cost, of course, is the price of the blades (and the Fusion creams if you choose to use their brand). This could be a big drawback for some, but I value the comfortable, nick-free shave this razor gives me and the extra cost is worth it.In my experience, the only better shave you can get is from a straight razor or good safety razor with the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush. But that makes a mess and is hard to master. I was actually going to try that route before I bought the Proglide... now, I don\'t have to! This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well. I\'m used to having to dip my razor in the water, tap it hard on the back, or some other way to unclog the blades after every few strokes. Not so with this one. Maybe because the blades are thinner? I don\'t know, but it just seems like it never clogs, even with some heavy growth to mow. That\'s another big plus in my book.I dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \'system\' of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave. I think those products are overpriced and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well. But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars. Do I wish the blades were cheaper? Sure. But I don\'t mind paying for something when it\'s actually worth the extra money, and to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money. Good job this time around, Gillette.    "

It was so light.  I ran my hand down the length of my leg and it was soooo smooth!  The contour pivoting head was so awesome as well.  I have knobby type knees and this thing just glided over them like it was skiing the Alps.  Then I gave it the ultimate challenge.  I hadn\'t tended to the bikini area for awhile so I gave that a go.  This razor just took care of all the business there like it was baby fine hair (which it was NOT).I like the fact that it comes with a suction cup razor holder but be sure to place this strategically in your shower or bathtub so no water runs directly on it because it will lose suction and you don\'t want to have water pouring over the Olay moisture bars.  I have used this razor for at least two weeks now (a total of 8 times) and the moisture bar does not look to have dwindled in size at all.  The blades (5 of them!) still seem ultra sharp.I definitely recommend this razor and honestly...I might toss the Mach one in the trash and use this baby full time.  The ONLY downside is that the moisture bar contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate and anyone who follows my reviews knows how I feel about that ingredient.  So, I am giving this product 4 stars only because of the SLS content.    "

I visited my friend couple of days ago and I had to borrow his razor, which was the Fusion.  The problem with this blade (and also the Quattro, and also to some degree the 3 bladed razors) is that because the blades are so close together, the cut hair gets stuck between the blades more easilly.  This requires more time rinsing between strokes, so it overall doesn\'t save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive, so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it\'s important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades (compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel) helps in shaving large parts of skin, like legs or whatever.  But when it\'s your face with its nooks and crannys, I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort. The 6th blade feature was OK, but didn\'t feel like it was worth it.Remember, that with any NEW blade, you will get an awesome shave.  People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it, because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they\'re reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit----Recently got this as a gift.

BOY, was I wrong.  It\'s been written in a few other reviews here, but it bears repeating:  This is easily the smoothest shave I\'ve ever had.  Moving with the grain, it doesn\'t even feel like a razor is touching your face.  Even going against the grain, there\'s smooth action and no nicks.the only problem i had was with the head being a little too big to effectively catch the area under your nose.  HOWEVER, there is a single blade on the back of the cartridge for this exact purpose.  I applaud Gillette for the research and customer feedback that went in to the design of this razor.I hate to sound like a commercial, but my wife felt my face after I shaved, and she said that it was the smoothest my face has ever been.

EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as \'Clean Shower\' or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.)Then I set the razor so it\'s standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I\'d also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I\'ve been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I\'ve nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I\'m very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.)Note to Gillette... Send me a lifetime supply of Fusion cartridges and I\'ll consider removing the blade-life extending tip from this review!  ;-)- Jonathan Sabin    "

The final result of the shave isn\'t any smoother than the non-power Fusion razor--that is, your face won\'t be any smoother after shaving than before--but the shaving process is smoother.  The vibrating head has a numbing effect that takes a shave or two to get used to but makes shaving smoother.

In the past, he bought whatever was on sale and used it until he hated it and tried something new.  He has very sensitive skin and could not use an electric razor, so he wasn\'t very keen on something that sounded suspiciously like it might be a hybrid of old and new.  Once he used it, he was delighted. In 30 plus years, I have never known his face to be so smooth and free of stubble. This is possibly the best shave he has ever gotten, and it left his skin smooth as a baby\'s face, and in great condition.  The shave was close, smooth, and he actually enjoyed using the razor.  He also told me to leave it alone, and to buy my own!  There are coupons in the papers this week, so I am going to do just that, and buy the one made for women.  This is a really great product.  It fits nicely in the hand, it\'s got an interesting shape, and it does what it promised to do.  I have very sensitive skin, and in the past when he rubbed his face against mine, I got red angry patches on my cheeks.  Not even a hint of it this time, so we are both very pleased with this product.  It seemed to float over his skin, and it left it in the best condition that I have ever seen.

Well, when used correctly (apply at night, which was hard to get used to) and not washing underneath my arms in the shower in the morning, it worked slightly better than what I\'m used to.  The problem is, however, that it\'s not realistic.  Sure, I can get used to applying deodorant on at night.  But can I get used to NOT scrubbing underneath my arms during my morning shower?  Ummm...no.I tried the unscented kind, which was fine - literally no scent.  I experienced no irritation or any other kind of side effect from it.I ended up being slightly drier, but still sweaty using the Gillette.  I\'m sure everyone is different, and maybe I\'m a profuse sweater, but it just didn\'t work enough for me to justify the premium (costs over twice what I normally get for marginal results).It might be worth a shot if you\'re desperately looking for a solution to underarm perspiration.

It was basically because the antiperspirant does not let your pits sweat at all, that they are basically blocking your the sweat glands which can lead to an infection.It may be different for, but for me I sweat easily despite being skinny, and non clinical strength ones do not work as well/barely for sweating.

1556,1608,20090521,B001JQLNFA,4,"May 21, 2009",A2K3DB7X56UXLZ,"Excellent razor, but no design improvements over existing Venus razors","For those who have used a Venus razor:  The only difference between this Venus and previous instances, as best as I could tell, was the scent of the gel/soap bars and the color of the razor handle.  Otherwise, it\'s the same razor.For those who have not used a Venus razor:There are three main features of a Venus razor versus a standard multi-blade women\'s razor.The first is the soap/gel bars.  These bars basically provide the glide that you usually get from shave gel or foam.  You can definitely shave without lathering up.  That saves you time and cost.  However, the bars do mean that you have to press a little harder than you might be used to when the razor head is new to get a close shave.  (As the bars wear down from use, you don\'t have to press as hard.)  Until you get used to this, you may notice some unintended stubble.  Also, the bars make it a little tough to clean the razor.  I\'ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I\'m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  It\'d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  I really liked the scent on this one, and I\'m not normally a fan of shave gel scents.The second big feature of the Venus line is the easy-to-change razor head.  When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  Then, you open a sealed replacement head and click the handle into the slot.  It\'s a much safer and easier replacement process than razors I\'ve owned in the past.  Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it\'s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  Each razor head is individually packaged, so it\'s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  You don\'t have to worry about cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.The third feature is the hanging rack.  The Venus razor kit comes with a mounting rack for your shower.  The rack sticks to the shower wall using adhesive pads, and it holds 4 replacement blades (not included) and the razor with a blade attached.  I\'ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  Gillette didn\'t improve on this design for the Spa Breeze line.  I was hoping they\'d offer a suction-cup design.  Also, the design is such that you can\'t really use it unless you wall mount it.  The razor needs gravity to stay in place, and because the bottom of the rack is rounded, you can\'t just set it vertically on a shelf.  I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.As for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  I have very fine hair.  Many razors just aren\'t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I\'ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)All in all, the Venus line is excellent.  I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  I\'d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.    "

Here\'s what she has to say about it:\'This razor is really smooth. It does a great job shaving, as it gets all the hair with one stroke and feels much nicer than the other razors I\'ve tried. It never cuts me. A strip underneath the blades applies a moisturizer, which keeps the razor from nicking me. It\'s nice to hold because it has a squishy handle.\'We have the green one, which looks really clean. The razor comes with a suction piece that holds it to the wall and stores extra blades.    "

467,477,20060225,B000BUUVTE,5,"February 25, 2006",A2DK2OY6R3WICK,"If you\'ve gotta use a blade, use this one!","Let\'s face it.  Guys usually don\'t get excited about new shaving products.  Shaving\'s about as pleasurable as a molten lava enema.  Fortunately, the right products can make it a little more bearable.  I\'ve never anticipated the release of a shaving product of any kind before, but this razor got me really intrigued.  Could this be the razor that conquers my impossible face (and wallet) once and for all?Gillette have been the masters of shaving comfort for several years now.  Their introduction of the Mach 3 razor was a breakthrough, just like they said.  A lot of you likely still use the Mach 3, but it\'s a good bet the Fusion will make you want to upgrade.I\'ll admit, I was a little wary about using a five-bladed razor.  I felt the same way about the Mach 3; I envisioned pressing too hard and slicing into my jugular, or worse, going to work with an entire roll of toilet paper on my face.  Thankfully, the opposite happened, and I used the Mach 3 and M3 Turbo for years.  I even bought into the M3 Power when it came out, but found there wasn\'t much difference in closeness or comfort (which is why I chose the manual Fusion over the Fusion Power).  Still a really good shave, though.Anyway, about the Fusion.  First off, don\'t be intimidated by the five blades.  They\'re close enough together that you really have to try to cut yourself.  In fact, that\'s one of the beauties of this razor.  Even a face like mine, which is very susceptible to cuts, accepted the Fusion\'s blades with very little irritation.  The first couple of times I used it, I had to watch out for pressing too hard and suffered a couple minor nicks, but I quickly got the hang of it.  The blades really do all the work.  The head of the razor is bigger than the M3 as well, which actually does cut down on shaving time.I\'ve always liked the \'indicator\' strip on the top of the M3 blade that lets me know when it\'s time to change the blade, and it\'s here on the Fusion as well.  It\'s made with aloe, if you\'re interested in that sort of thing, which supposedly aids in shaving comfort.  You\'ll get about a week\'s worth of good shaves before the blade wears out, which works out to a pack of cartridges a month (about the same as the M3).  It\'s best to pick these up in bulk (packs of 8); if and when you switch to this razor, you\'ll need them anyway, and you\'ll save a little dough in the process.The extra blade on the back of the razor is rather neat indeed.  It does help even out your sideburns and touches up those tricky spots right under your nose and above your chin.  I wouldn\'t use it for beard sculpting or anything, but for tough areas it does a good job.  Just be mindful of that blade when you\'re shaving near your ears.  I accidentally nicked my earlobe shaving my jawline the first time I used it. Yeowch!Changing the blade out is just as easy as the M3 also.  Just pop, slide, and click a new blade in.The \'comfort guard\' under the main blades is a slight improvement from the M3, but it\'s not really a \'wow\' factor.  The \'ergonomic\' handle is pure gimmick; it does little more than make the Fusion look like a phaser from Star Trek.  I would rather just buy the blades and have them fit on my Mach 3, but what kind of marketing savvy would that be?  Oh well; the razor itself isn\'t exactly a bank-breaker, and you only have to buy it once.All told, this is the Porsche 911 of razors.  It\'s a smooth ride, it\'s comfortable, it\'s fast, and yes, even though the blades are pricey, it\'s worth it to me.  If I had my druthers, of course, I\'d use an electric (they\'re much less expensive in the long run), but they\'re just not compatible with my face and Rocky Mountain-ish peaks and valleys of my neck.  (Believe me; I\'ve tried five different kinds.)  The Fusion\'s the closest shave I\'ve gotten with a blade yet.  If you really saw the difference between the M3 and M3 Power on your face, you\'ll probably notice it with the Fusion Power as well, but I figure I\'m paying enough for the one without the motor.I\'m glad I made the switch, and after comparing with the Mach 3, I won\'t go back.  Try it and see for yourself.    "

I was hoping they did not, so I could stock up on older original Fusion blades as they went on clearance.

Not to put too fine a point on it but if a razor doesn\'t julienne my skin during the process of removing hair, I\'m satisfied.I was was somewhat stupefied when I opened the package and discovered that the handle had no loaded cartridge--the analogy that occurred to me was Carolyn Jones as Morticia Addams snipping off the heads of flowers. This, if it wasn\'t an oversight, struck me as kind of cheesy. I used the razor on my legs and underarms, without lather, and it did a good job and allowed me to retain my epidermis. I really don\'t know how long the lubricating action will last but I\'m sure it will continue to perform just as well with lather (I should add that my body hair is sparse and fine and doesn\'t dull a blade very fast).Speaking of cheesy, the oh-so-classy, \'sure you can spare it?\' holder-on-a-suction cup that\'s useless on a bathroom wall with very small tiles would have better been left on the drawing board.

First off, great design from the shape of the handle etc to the holder itself. If you like cool industrial design for the masses (think Michael Graves and so on at Target) then this will make you happy. It\'s also an impressive piece of manufacturing, that they can get the five blades lined up with such accuracy. Extra points for the design geeks.More importantly of course, the shaving experience itself. I live in Minnesota which right now (winter) has quite a dry climate, so a harsh shave will leave you with raw, uncomfortable skin for most of the day. I\'m not sure if this razor gave a closer shave than with my Mach 3, but it certainly was way quicker and required fewer re-strokes, which cuts down on irritation and the potential for nicks and cuts. It was easy to shave the hard-to-manage parts of my face where the hairs aren\'t all lying in the same direction, like under my jaw, which again cut down on the number of re-strokes. Once I got used to the extra razor on the back of the cartridge, I liked the way I could use it as advertised: for near my nose, round my goatee etc.I have to admit that I thought five blades sounded ridiculous, but it does seem to work just as stated in the manufacturer\'s blurb.UPDATE: Now had this for about two weeks, and I\'m continuing to be happy with it.

453,463,20060419,B000BUUVTE,2,"April 19, 2006",A1GWQB7Q7I00N5,Very disappointed,"I ended up buying this only because I couldn\'t find Mach3 cartridges and was desparate for a new blade. The first couple days using the Fusion were okay, but I immeadiately noticed I couldn\'t get as close a shave as with the Mach3. A lot of this is that the Fusion has a large surface area, so it\'s hard to do a lot of detail work, sort of like painting with a roller brush. The single blade on the back is supposed to compensate for this, but except for doing a mediocre job of cleaning up strays under my nose, the single blade was useless. The first Fusion cartridge gave up on me after about a week and left my face barely looked different before and after the shave. Even after replacing the cartridge, my face seemed to get used to the Fusion quickly and stubbornly refused to give me a good looking shave, no matter how many times I scraped those Fusion blades over my mug. I also found myself working harder to get the shaving gel and water off the Fusion between strokes, which is annoying.I should say that my face is a little weird in that the hairs grow very slowly but are very tough. I used to shave against the grain (up the face) for this reason but found I could get away with shaving with the grain using a Mach3 regularly. So, for people with softer facial hair, the story might be different.The one advantage I\'d give the Fusion is that it does tend to work best when you only use one stroke down an area, so for people who get easily irritated by multiple blade strokes over the same area, this could help.I switched back to a Mach3 blade this morning though, and couldn\'t be happier. I have a lot more control over the shave, it\'s cheaper to buy the cartridges, and in general it\'s just a better experience. It will be a sad day when/if Gillette drops their Mach3 line, probably in favor of some 9-bladed shaving monstrosity.    "

I\'ve also got the Gillette Fusion 5-blade shaver, and I definitely prefer 3 blades, especially for travel.  Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.    "

I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it\'s simply a \'clean\' scent that softens as you wear it.  I don\'t find it competing with my perfume and haven\'t noticed it to be overpowering.Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.The product isn\'t invisible and will get on your clothes if you\'re not careful.

For shaving the rest of the head, it was no better then any other good blade.For shaving the face, the balance was good, but that was about it.  There was no difference in irritation between the two blades.  The lubricating strip faded to white after about four shaves, meaning you are no longer getting what Gillette calls an \'optimal shaving experience.\'I tried to trim the chin area between my fumanchu moustache.

The sensation wasn\'t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.  In my experience, though, it doesn\'t.  I don\'t feel I\'m getting a shave that is any better or closer than I get with my regular, non-power Fusion.  And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly.  So, this razor isn\'t really delivering a closer shave, it\'s taking me longer to shave, and I found the vibration to be annoying.  It\'s not something I intend to use.  If any of this seems intriguing to you, though, you may want to try it out.    "

I was quite surprised that after two weeks using the Proglide that I have to say it does indeed provide a better shave than the previously mentioned model. I\'m not sure it it\'s the thinner blades that seem to offer much less resistance both against the grain as well as with it, or one of the other features. The power version also has a feature that claims to guide the hairs in straighter for a more close, even cut. While I\'m not sure if this is a gimmick or not, the proof seems to be in the proverbial pudding. For me, the shaves have been much better with less irritaion, and so far the blades seem to last longer than the old version. On the older version I could only get three good shaves at the most before feeling it was time to replace them. With the proglide I only have had to change the blades once in two weeks, and the performance has always been fantastic. Of course, these statements are just my \'two cents\' worth, as shaving is very subjective and there are so many factors that go in to a great shave. But for my purposes, this new Proglide seems to fit the bill very nicely.    "

It doesn\'t really matter what the product states it can do as it all comes down to personal preference. Here\'s my two cents:The pluses:Can\'t see it. It does stick to its promise in that it doesn\'t show on your clothing. Black or otherwise. (if you accidentally put on too much then it will show)While I did find that the scent hits you very strongly at first it does tone down shortly after applying. Oddly enough others asked what I was wearing and told me it was very pleasant.Applying this deodorant was fairly easy. With other stick deodorants it feels like you\'re rubbing a rock under your arm, uncomfortable. This was unlike others and applied smoothly.The big minus:Kind of uncomfortable. While application is pretty smooth actually wearing it is not. After wearing it for a couple of hours it begins to, for lack of a better word, chafe. The downfall of stick deodorant begins to shine through. As the moisture of the deodorant begins to disappear you are left with a powdery irritating feeling.The Rundown:I work in an office and don\'t really find myself in the situations where I\'m sweating profusely. Because of this the anti-perspiration factor is, to me, not needed. A product that is strictly deodorant tends to work best.I\'ll be sticking to my Old Spice Red Zone.

However I have to admit this razor gives a really comfortable shave. The ergonomics are the best I\'ve come across, well balanced, correctly angled head, substantial weight with battery installed.  The five-blade cluster is more than just gimmickry, it provides a wider shaving area, which is more stable as you shave. The vibrating gimmick is just that, however. It seems to add nothing to the shave and it completely eliminates any tactile feedback, which I find necessary for a good shave. New blades are quite expensive, usually $3-$4 each, pretty steep but you may find the comfort of the shave is worth it (I\'m still unsure). To sum up, pass on the powered version and go with the cheaper \'manual\' version and be prepared to pay a lot for new blades.    "

Not comfortable at all, and because of the pain, I couldn\'t shave as close.As for using this razor to shave hard to reach areas, they must be kidding!

To accomodate the five blades the razor pad is so large it\'s difficult to share accurately.

I\'ve read conflicting stories about the history of disposable razor blades and I\'m not sure what to believe. But it seems to me that disposable razor blades and cartridge type blades in particular, like printer inks, are high profit margin items that deserve to be characterized as ripoffs. I recently tried using old fashioned double edge razors, the kind I stated with when I started shaving in the last sixties - I not only have my own old double-edge blade holder but have two even older ones that I inherited from my late dad - but as has always been my experience, I could not get through a shave without an annoying cut or two (and then I end up going out with little pieces of bloody tissue stuck to my face). If I thought I could get a clean, bloodless shave with a straight razor I\'d go that route. Electric razors can be okay in a pinch but it takes too much time and effort for me to get a really clean shave with an electric, and even then it\'s never as clean as the shave I can get with a Mach3. (I discovered Aveeno shave gel a few years ago and though I don\'t have sensitive skin, I\'ve found that it works better for me than any other gel or cream I\'ve used.)Obviously, not all guys have as good an experience with the Mach3 as I\'ve had, and that makes sense, because every guy\'s beard and skin is different.When I have more than a couple of day\'s growth, I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work.

The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.    "

BUT Watch out for fakes!,"First, I want to explain that I gave 5-stars because this is a product review and this product is excellent as a razor blade. HOWEVER, be careful where you buy it from, some sellers especially on ebay and amazon (third parties) are selling FAKE blades. It\'s hard to recognize at first but you can tell from a few things:1. If you are familiar with Gillette shave, you will feel the difference immediately. For example, my one-month old genuine Gillette razor still shaves better than a fake one.2. Lubricating strip on the fake one is not real. So, how do you know it? With real Gillette product you can immediately feel there is a lot of lubricant (a little sticky moisture feeling), BUT with the fake one, your face will feel very dry even when you used the blades for the first time. Because they are not lubricating! They are fake strips and made out of some plastic kind material.3. Even after many months of use, If you try to remove lubricating strip on your real Gillette product, you can see that there is still a lot of lubricant just under the strip and on the strip itself. And this strip is a one piece well-aligned strip, easy to remove and easy to put back. BUT, if you remove the fake one\'s strip, this just plastic kind strip will break into parts and you cannot put it back in place.4. If you have a good eye, look closely to see if all three blades are leveled and adjusted as parallel to each other. Usually, on the fake ones, you will see a slight misalignment, basically they are out of line and think about it, what it can do to your face. Check all the blades in the box individually. None of them should be misaligned.5. Look closely to see small black dots on the blades. Original Mach3 blades have a little larger dots and their paint does not feel as precise as the fake ones. This is because, real ones have an almost invisible clear coat but you can see it if you look at the black dots directly.6. Look at the blue plastic strip just under the blades, now try to abuse them with the tip of your fingernails (Be careful do not cut your fingers).They are many micro-aligned plastic lines, and When you do this, they re-align themselves immediately without no damage to themselves. BUT on fake ones, they try to align back, but they can\'t! They always leave marks on abused spots on them.7. Look at the front side of blades. Just under the moving head, you will see five parallel lines on the plastic stable part. On the real one the line in the middle is slightly thicker than other ones. But on the fake one they may show difference. And the fake ones, usually (not always) a little darker in color of plastic, if you have good eyes.8. Now a little flexibility test. You know Mach3s has flexible heads. Fake ones, too... However, if you move the head with your finger to the back, it should come back to the original place with a smooth movement. On the fake ones, they come back but they come back quicker than the real ones. And fake ones even make a slight plastic sound when coming back.9. Look at the plastic cartridge holder if it has serial number printed on it. If so, it still DOESN\'T mean they are real. Nowadays, they are putting serial numbers on fake ones, too. So, follow the first 8 steps, to make sure you have the real ones.Nowadays, fakes are so close to real, I hope this review helps to all of you. I know some of the sellers who sell fake ones will find this review not useful. BUT using genuine razors is a health issue so be careful. And always buy from reliable sellers. Amazon itself is very reliable but be careful with other third party sellers. Read their reviews first!    "

I hate the razors that offer three and even four blades, as I have no desire to cut my face the way those 3- and 4-bladers all but demand. So I took a look on Amazon, after finding it a good, cheap source for other products I normally buy at the store, and sure enough, here they were. So now I can use my two-blade razor again, instead of subjecting myself to all those cuts and abrasions.I buy them on subscription, and save 15%, making a sweet deal even a little sweeter.    "

772,798,20070425,B000BUW8WM,4,"April 25, 2007",A1YFX3KREPTCZ8,Better than I expected,"Before trying this razor, I was using the Mach III (which was a good razor as well, although I never used the Mach III Power); and despite my best efforts not to get sucked into advertising, I decided to try the Fusion Power after seeing the commercials. But now I\'m glad I switched.I only shave every other day, and rarely on weekends, so sometimes I\'ll go 3 or 4 days without shaving. And the Fusion does a great job with the extra growth. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the \'comfort guard\' helps make it a smooth cut. And the power part is a big help; once I\'m done, it\'s a closer shave than the Mach III was. I also have a goatee, and the main blade of the Fusion can actually trim the edges.There are only 2 minor negatives to the Fusion: Cleaning out the comfort guard is a bit of a hassle, and the blue guard makes it hard to see any hair (mine is dark brown) that\'s been caught in it; and the battery indicator is basically useless. It\'s been \'low\' for several weeks, and a brand new battery didn\'t make a difference. So I guess when the razor stops working I\'ll know the battery is dead.Overall, a good step up from a simple razor.Update (11/17/07): It seems I misunderstood the battery indicator, which I apparently didn\'t look at very closely when I bought the razor. I thought the battery symbol on the razor would indicate when the battery was low, and that\'s why I thought it was \'low\' for so long; I didn\'t realize that it was like that all the time! The entire area around the battery symbol and the power button will actually flash orange when the battery is low, as I discovered this week. So I apologize to anyone that might have read my review and was misinformed because of it. And now the only minor negative about the razor is still the issue of cleaning the comfort guard.On the positive side, however, it seems the Fusion will last quite a while on one battery: Mine was still going strong in April when I originally posted this review -- and I had had the razor for some time then -- and despite the fact that I don\'t shave every day, the original battery (which I put back in after a new one didn\'t matter) lasted until now.

It has little \'wings\' of soap on either side of the triple blades that flex to fit the contours of the body.  Its \'white tea\' fragrance is pleasing but mild, and I think it would pass muster with most sensitive noses.  The grip is comfortable even in my nondominant hand, and the light pink color is very subtle--not too girlie.  About the only minor gripe that I had with the Sea Breeze is that it comes with a bulky holding case that can be mounted on the wall of a shower.  The case is intended to store the razor and a couple of blade-and-soap cartridges, but it was not too esthetic so I just didn\'t install it.  Otherwise,this item deserves a high recommendation.

1502,1552,20100918,B001G7PMW2,5,"September 18, 2010",A2OZIY67Q6ND06,Is what it is,"Ok, in perspective this is a good razor.  You could say it is a hybrid trac II.In my opinion, putting more blades on is a scam for you to buy more blades at a higher cost, keep in mind these are aluminium sharpened fine and coated for comfort, wrapped in plastic to attach at the head.Multi blades are going to last longer, common sense should tell you though, to put another 1-2-3 more blades in a razor shouldn\'t drive the cost up another $20.00 to $30.00.So as not to get off track, this razor system is great, the regular blades provide a close shave, the handle is at such an angle you can see those hard to get to places such as nose, sides, jawline.The sensor blades which are a little better, can provide a comfortable shave for people with more sensative skin, I find using barbasol with aloe or something comparable will give a close shave yet not have that burn afterward.My shave routine consists of:1.  cold water splash on the face, this tightens the pours of the skin and makes the whiskers stand up a little better.2.  I use barbasol regular, it\'s cheap, it\'s foam, and it does the job.3.  where you start is up to you, I usually start right to left going with the flow of the whiskers.  Never go against the grain as this will give you bumps (pseudofoliculitis barbae)and that can be a little uncomfortable or not look so good on that hot date or job interview.4.  after I shave i jump in the shower, however, if you don\'t always rinse.  This gets the cream off and any sediment such as left over whiskers and keeps them from entering skin pours and causing irritation, a big pimple or a serious infection.5.  Now, this is optional and I would recommend this for guys starting to shave.  Try some after shave lotion, it soothes the skin so you don\'t have that burn feeling all day, it also tightens the pours so you have a smooth shave longer and the girls appreciate a man that smells good and has a smooth face.i hope this helps some of you, pick what works for you.By the way gillette, I bet you are losing money on your blades, try lowering the prices for the everyday guy to afford to shave.

The soft green palette is pleasing to the eye, and the shaped handle has a rubberized grip that makes it easy to grasp when wet. The head is large and contoured, ideal for mowing down wide swaths of follicular profusion. The shower caddy is a neat idea. It is backed by two suction cups for gripping the shower stall (tip: works better when wet) that conceals a small, swing-out storage space for extra blades. The swing gets loose easily, so careful!

The triple blades are usually very long lasting, but with the irritating little pads dragging along your shaving surface, the long-life blades become an unusable waste. If your skin\'s not sensitive, this might not be an issue.That said, it does give a great shave, even on bikini line, and it is very handy to have an all-in one for travel.    "

I had been using the Mach 3 and Gillette 3 blade disposible (along with Edge Ultra-sensitive gel), but noticed more and more razor bumps. It got so bad, that I had to take the day off from work because I couldn\'t show my totally raw/cut/irritated face.  Needless to say, my skin is sensitive.Well, I didn\'t shave for 2 days trying to baby my skin so it would recover.  The next day, I had to shave so I had to make a decisionAs with most cases, when I need something answered, or need other people\'s opinions, I fired up the good ol\' web browser.  I started by researching electric razors since I heard they were easier on your face, but after reading the reviews, I couldn\'t see spending $150 for something that may not even help and probably wouldn\'t give me as close a shave.I had heard of the Fusion and it did sound interesting to me.  The 5 blade feature didn\'t impress me as much as the fact that the blades are closer together.  I figured if they\'re closer it wouldn\'t give my skin the chance to get between them and be sliced off - excuse my graphic language :) I looked up reviews on the Fusion and found some mention of it being good for sensitive skin.  That did it for me, so off I went to buy a Fusion.When I got to the store, their were rows and rows of empty racks (I would guess at least 20 rows) where all the Fusions had been.  Seems like they\'re very popular with the local crowd.  Anyhow there was ONE left and I nabbed it.Got it home and immediately went in to shave.What a difference!  No razor new razor bumps, and it didn\'t even irritate the old ones (from my Gillette disposables).  No cuts, no irritation whatsoever!  And it really gives you a smooth shave.  Even my wife was impressed with my smooth face!So, moral to this story.  If you have sensitive skin, and you want a really close shave with no irritation, get the Fusion.  And yes I agree, the cartridges are pretty expensive, but to me my face is worth it.    "

When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn\'t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn\'t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.So because of this I started checking out \'modern\' regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.    "

I have a tough beard and sensitive skin. A bad combination. I bought the Fusion on a whim. I didn\'t expect it to be signficantly better than the previous generation Mach 3 but hope springs eternal. After two weeks and 7-8 shaves with the same cartridge(!), I can wholeheartedly say that this is a very noticeable improvement over the Mach 3. The cartridges have an astounding life. The Mach 3 would give me about 3-4 shaves before the blades dulled enough to result in razor rash. The Fusion has at least doubled that and is still going strong. Amazing. The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if Gillette is using a higher quality steel in the blades for the product launch. Time will tell. Secondly, I get far less razor burn from the Fusion. Almost none actually. Lastly, it\'s more difficult to cut myself in the nose/lip area which was something I had to watch carefully with the Mach 3. I\'d guess this has to do with a larger blade surface area. In short, the Fusion really is an improvement over the Mach 3. As long as the cartridges continue to last for 8-10 shaves each, I will be a loyal customer.    "

When I first started shaving, about a year ago ( I\'m kinda new to this), I used my moms pink plastic cheapo gillettes that come in packs of like ten. These sucked! Everytime I shaved I would get a new Nick or cut. They didn\'t get all the hair, having only two blades, and irritated my skin. Next, my stepmom bought a pack of cvs brand rip offs of the bic soleil. I thought I was in heaven. These didn\'t Nick quite as much, and had a grippier handle, so there were no slips. I honestly liked this razor, at least compared to those two bladed ones. Then my sister decided to buy herself a Venus spa breeze. I admit to trying it once of twice. This was an even better shave than the cvs ones. The only problem I had where those big shave gel bars. They were slimy and left residue on my legs. I still liked the shave though, but didn\'t want to spend money at the time on sething I wasn\'t completly satisfied with, so I went back to the cvs ones. Finally after hearing my friend raving about the Venus embrace, I thought I\'d try it out. It wasn\'t that expensive, and if I didn\'t like it, I just wodn\'t buy refills. So I bought it. I was in love.The 5 blades cut a little bit closer than the cvs brand \' soleil\'. I didn\'t miss any hairs, even though I only took one pass on each section. I even got a close shave on my knees, thanks to the pivoting head. I also found that my shave took a lot les time. I was done in about half the time it usually took me. I didn\'t even get any cuts.The ribbon of moisture works great. My legs are less irritated than before and it really gave a smooth shave.The soft grip handle was a comfortable fit in my palm. I wouldn\'t say it was grippier than the cvs, but it was certainly a step up from the gillettes.The only thingni felt was not nesasary was the shower pod. Idont keep my razor in the shower anyways, because my younger sis has a tendancy to steal and use my razor. With a razor like this I knew she would want to try it out.

Using these blades while sharp I almost never nick myself. My facial hair is a little tough so I used to have trouble getting a clean shave on the first try. With these razors that\'s never been an issue for me.Granted, these are the most expensive razors you\'ll typically see in stores. However, the amazon price is great (especially with subscribe & save). Moreover, using tips I saw on another razor review, I can get an individual Gillette razor to last about a month. By rinsing the gunk off with hot water after shaving, spraying the razor with shower cleaner, then propping it against the wall the durability improves dramatically.Honestly, if I hadn\'t discovered I could make a single razor last a month I wouldn\'t bother buying these. I think they\'re the best, but they\'re not THAT much better than other razors. A dull razor is a dull razor regardless of brand. Yet, if you can make a razor 12 pack last a year, and they\'re so cheap on Amazon, why not buy the best?    "
989,1018,20100803,B000XVSNTQ,3,"August 3, 2010",A2GHU8I0P3HFRW,More Mortal than Goddess....,"OVERVIEW: This is a perfectly adequate razor. It\'s neither wonderful nor terrible. It\'s ok. The review by Cherise Everhard nails it.LONG VERSION: Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty must be reclining comfortably in her mansion in the Pantheon subdivision on Mount Olympus, counting the revenue from her licensing deal with Gillette. The sale of the razor blades alone must be quite profitable, allowing her to fill her closets with designer togas.This is one of those products that get written about in marketing studies. Where the basic item, a computer printer, for example, has a reasonable retail price but the ink refills are the longterm profit center. In this case, the razor is quite a good value, the price of the razor blades, however, leave you breathless!I myself was seduced by the allure of Venus when a women\'s magazine named the Venus Embrace Razor one of the beauty innovations of the year. (Yes, I read women\'s magazines! So what? This is a women\'s product! If you are a guy reading this review, you can just take off your judgemental hat and go back to watching the droning ball game on the sofa where you usually repose. Relax, have a beer!)Not being able to purchase Mach 2 razor blades anywhere for any price was causing me upset. I had a perfectly good razor that was totally useless. I bought a Soleil. It was French. It was pink-orange and white like a creamsicle. It was curved like a dolphin. It had three blades which was one more than the Mach 2 had. I was unimpressed.So, there I was, with a three bladed razor thinking that this was not nearly enough.Listen, hair removal is a tricky business. There are multiple solutions to the problem, some very, very bad and some very, very good. With chemotherapy and radiation being the very worst solutions, the best solution, in my admittedly fairly limited experience, is waxing. Unfortunately there are times when waxing is inconvenient. Like 10 minutes before you are planning to leave for the beach and you feel some stubble on your ankles. This is when you really need a razor.So I read about the Venus Embrace being an innovation of the year and I was hooked.What you get when you buy the \'starter kit\' is:- A pretty, ergonomically curved razor that has \'attractive sea foam green and turquoise\' (purple and teal) colored gel inserts on the handle. These cause a squishy/sticky feel that is not unpleasant but somewhat odd.... like holding a silicone spatula or a dog toy. The manufacturer claims that these gel inserts cause the razor handle to sit more firmly in the hand and not to slip.-The blade. The \'business end\' of the razor is HUGE! Its an oval shaped disk that contains five \'spring mounted\' blades that are surrounded by wide areas of plastic covered by variously colored slippery coatings that the manufacturer describes as \' Protective Ribbon of Moisture\'.-An extra razor cartride which comes packed in a clever, water-proof, sealed plastic container.-A plastic \'Shower Pod\' which is a small holder for the razor and extra blades that is supposed to attach to the bathroom tile with a suction cup.The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is the sticky/squishy feel of the razor handle. The blade cartridge sits safely in its sealed plastic container and is easily inserted on to the handle.The blade is sized perhaps for true Olympians like Venus Williams rather than mere mortal-sized women such as I. Did I mention is is HUGE? Paul Bunyon huge. Yo, Venus! Did you actually approve the size of this cartridge? I bet not.The shower pod is a tacky plastic thing that would not stay suctioned to my tile wall. It went directly into the trash.Although the razor head pivots, the blades are \'spring loaded\', there are moisture strips, and the handle is curved and tricked out with gel inserts, the Venus Embrace razor is unwieldy. It just doesn\'t go where you want it to go when you want it to go there. And when it goes there you don\'t really get such a close shave. I don\'t notice any better shaving than with my old Mach 2.What I have noticed about the Venus Embrace is that I have not cut myself once and I have not experienced razor burn. These were not significant problems with my Mach 2 but I thought I should mention them.My fundamental saddness with this product arrived when I needed to purchase additional blades and sticker shock set in. Three buckeroos a cartridge makes one think once or twice about continuing to use this razor. Sorry Goddess Venus, but that\'s one Sister\'s opinion.    "

Applied Gillette Fusion shaving cream and tested it next to my old Fusion. No difference, what so ever. The \'larger handle\' is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size. The shave was no closer, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide. Having said that, I can\'t complain, they sent it too me for free.It\'s an excellent marketing ploy designed to influence Americans to buy whatever product big businesses want us to buy next. Having said that, I see no reason to switch from my old Fusion to newer and more expensive cartridges. It received three stars due to the promises made by Gillette, and the fact there older products are just as functional as this newer, more expensive one.    "

When new, they give a very nice clean, smooth, and even shave on your face.After that, it\'s a MAJOR pain to clean out the whiskers that get caught between the triple blades.  I had to spend 10 minutes shaking the razor in both standing and running water to clean it out.  Now when you\'re up in the morning trying to get ready for work, you don\'t have that kind of time to spare cleaning a razor.Problem is, if you don\'t clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.Also, even after cleaning, it doesn\'t last very long at all.  On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &quot;indicator strip&quot; sooner.I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem.

I\'d had a not-so-good experience with the Quattro, so I was a little wary when I discovered this one had even more blades.My experience with the Fusion: It does grab the stubble and take it off slightly better than the M3 Power, but ONLY shaving counter to the direction of the beard growth.  When I shave, I usually mix my strokes up and down, and found that this razor did not remove the beard as well as the M3 Power when shaving on the downstroke.  So I had to restroke my face on certain areas which remained rough after the initial shave, which actually added to my shaving time.  I can only assume the other reviewers who said shaving time was decreased, use only upstrokes when shaving.Second, I was very disappointed when the blue indicator strip disappeared completely right after the first shave.  Refill blades are more expensive than the M3 Power, which usually last me 2 or 3 shaves at least.The last con I have is that the battery button is a bit too sensitive and placed exactly where I like to hold the razor with a firm grip.  Twice while I was shaving I accidentally switched it off.Conclusion:  I would use the Fusion to shave only for special or formal occasions, because of the cost of replacement blades and the shaving style needed for optimum work outweigh the benefits of the slightly better shave I could get.For regular everyday shaving, I\'m sticking with the M3 Power.

That is, you need to apply this at bedtime in order for it to work optimally.  The package insert explains why -- applying the product before you sleep allows it to \'form better plugs\' -- which, while disgusting-sounding, is how antiperspirants tend to work -- the aluminum compound plugs and temporarily deactivates your sweat glands.  So your armpits will also feel kindof nasty and coated when you go to wash them next, but so it goes with this type of product.  The package insert also explains that the aluminum compound in this particular product is different from that used in most antiperspirants, and that it allows for less irritation and better performance -- I can\'t really speak to the accuracy of those claims as I\'ve never experienced irritation or problems with other brands.The scent of the product is mild, and quite unisex.Overall, this product does what it says if you follow directions -- but I\'m not sure I\'ll use regularly as I\'m not fond of the way it makes my underarms feel.

I always found that women\'s razors worked better for this area because men\'s razors are meant for the face (I use the Gillette Fusion for this every other day activity) and have tried quite a bit since I started with this habit back in 2002/2003.  Like with the men\'s razors the products keep getting better with time and the Venus Spa Breeze is no exception.  With this latest incarnation the soap has been attached to the blades and a nice scent has been added as upgrades.  The old Venus blades always worked great but this upgrade is definitely a worthwhile one.  The pros are that the soap produced makes for a smoother shave and more clean and the smell really is nice.  The cons are that I would imagine these new blades are much more $$$ than the old Venus razors with regular cream and the soap attached doesn\'t allow you the same kind of control that you had before.If you like not having to lather up and don\'t mind spending the extra money this is a fine product.

Since I have a unisex name,  I occasionally get men\'s products. Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it. I\'ve never used a razor with the vibrating feature on it before, but I found this great for my legs, especially my knees and ankles. I\'ve NEVER cut myself using this blade, because with the vibration turned on, it\'s pretty much impossible for me to press down too hard. It doesn\'t vibrate too much to where it\'s noisy or annoying.As far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth. I can go 2-3 days between shaves, and when my hair starts to regrow, the hair is finer and not as \'stubbly.\' I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I\'ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus. I also love that this works so well on my underarms. Because it\'s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I\'ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before. This shaves super close without cutting or razor burn. And my legs are smooth ALL day, even if I shave at 8 in the morning. They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night. Ladies, you know what I\'m talking about.I haven\'t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy. The blades seem to last a while, at least 3-4 weeks shaving every other day or so. However, when they go dull, they go dull quickly.The only things I didn\'t like about this razor: one, it didn\'t come with a blade refill, like every other razor I\'ve ever bought, so that was kind of annoying. Also, the refills are expensive. Don\'t buy the \'power\' refills if you don\'t use the trimmer- that\'s the only difference between the \'power\' blades and the \'manual\' blades, and there\'s a dollar difference between the two. I don\'t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out that it\'s just an exposed blade on the opposite side, but I can see how men might find it useful.Overall, this is my favorite razor.

(my first razor was the Gillette Sensor)I do believe this gives me the best shave from Gillette since I started using their cartridge razors.  The problem is that with each new razor comes a price increase.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor cartridges sells for $3.50-$4.00 per cartridge...Ouch!!  Thinking for years that buying the 4 and 8 pack refills was a rip-off, I looked into DE shaving.  I bought an old Gillette Super Speed safety razor and a sample pack Double Edge razor blades and started learning the proper way to shave.  A little math now...at $3.50/cartridge for Gillette Fusion I will spend $182.00/year for razors.  I can\'t use them for more than a week.  In fact the proglide razor seems to lose performance after the 3rd shave for me, but I push it to 6 shaves.  I can buy a 100 pack of Astra DE razor blades for $15.75.  That\'s (rounded up) $.16/razor.  I can use them for 1 week also, so I spend $8.32/year for DE razors.  After a couple month of learning to shave with a DE razor I\'m now getting the same (if not better) results than I get with the Fusion Pro Glide.  The only advantage that the Fusion ProGlide has over old school DE razors is that it is a little quicker, but $173.68 per year in savings is enough to get me off the cartridge razor bandwagon, and into the Double Edge Razor bandwagon.

I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \'made for a woman, not a man.\'  This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.Like the standard (purple) VENUS BREEZE, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR (pale pink) comes with a holder which mounts directly to the wall of your shower or bath.  Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  The three blades are surrounded by gel bars.  There is no need to use shaving cream; just moisten the gel bars to get that silky, satiny feel.  The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme climate.To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  This will help any razor to give you a closer shaver.  While you are soaking, get the cartridge wet, so that the gel gets creamy.  You never want to shave with a dry razor anyway...ouch!  I usually just toss the razor in the tub for a minute or two.  Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  Just one less thing to worry about.The only negative about the VENUS BREEZE is that the gel bars do not last as long as the blades!  With care, the blades in each cartridge last up to a month.  (The triple blades shave my legs so close, that I really only need to shave them every other day.)  But the gel bars either run out or fall off in 2 - 3 weeks.  Then I go back to the shaving cream until the blades give out.Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  I have been satisfied with it for many years.  If Gillette could just make the gel bars last a bit longer...the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.    "

I felt several times like I had razor burn, and actually skipped shaving under my arms one day because of the irritation.  I actually tried to give this the benefit of the doubt, and used it for several weeks, using several extra blades...I was just not impressed.  The shave was too close, resulting in bumps and an uncomfortable burn on my legs and underarms, not too mention the bikini area.  I want a smooth shave, but I don\'t want razor burn.I did, however, really like the grip and feel of the handle of the razor, and loved the handy dandy shower caddy, with the suction cups, and little cubby for extra blades.

I had a 2-3 day stubble- always problematic, especially above the chin and the upper lip- and it cut through that like butter.  Contrary to what a few of the other reviewers said, I feel that the vibration materially improves the feel of the shave- I turned it off and felt quite a difference.

This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps.  The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke.  So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it\'s no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose.  The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze.  Alas, it was worthless.  I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June.  Hopefully it doesn\'t bump sensors off the shelves.  Just in case, I\'m going to calculate the number of shaves I\'ll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.    "

I\'m not looking for a religious experience when I shave - just smooth skin without irritation, nicks or cuts.  The Proglide gives a good but not superior result, and Gillette\'s instructions for an optimal shave require too much prep time.  Also, Gillette hints that the razor may dull after 5 shaves.  It does and the \'special lubricating strip\' wears out sooner.  Frequent razor replacement in addition to the cost of a better quality shave cream is ridiculously expensive.

I needed the travel bag, and it was only (...) for the bag and all the free stuff, so it was a no-brainer).What I like about this razor:1. It\'s pink.2. It\'s thin, girly and cute.3. It\'s comfortable to hold.4. It has the built-in shaving gel.Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 of those are all really superficial and don\'t amount to much.What I don\'t like about this razor:1. The very first thing I noticed about it is that there is a slimy, goopy gook that stretches (picture okra or chicken slime when you\'re cleaning it) as you shave. It is absolutely, positively gross and unsightly. Perhaps I\'m making too big a deal of that, but I have a weak stomach, and that really grossed me out.2. I wet my legs, turned the shower off, and sat down inside.  After I shaved my right leg, I immediately began shaving my left leg (I had some Nair on my bikini area, so I didn\'t have time to waste). While I was shaving my left leg, my right leg began to sting. After about two minutes, it became unbearable, so even though the time wasn\'t up on my Nair and I hadn\'t quite finished my left leg, I had to get under some running water.  THAT MADE IT WORSE!!! Both my legs began to burn! Discomfort is an understatement. I was in pain! I don\'t normally have sensitive skin, and this was the first time I\'ve ever had a shaving product to make me feel that way. It was absolutely unbearable.So bad that I actually had to write a review. I think in my entire life, I may have been compelled to write a review once or twice. That\'s how bad this experience was. So it\'s been about 15 minutes since I got out the shower. My legs aren\'t burning anymore, and they feel somewhat smooth. Not as smooth as my regular razor (Schick Intuition - which is nice and gives great results, but so bulky and big), but it\'ll do.

The reason is, no matter how careful I REALLY try to be, I ALWAYS end up with a nick somewhere.  Picture shorts with little pieces of tissue looking like polka dots on your legs!  Normally, I shave my legs in a tub rather than a shower, as the leg is not flexed and there is less chance of a nick - though somehow I always managed (especially around the shin bone) to draw blood.HOWEVER, all that changed with the new Gillette Venus Embrace Razor!  No nicks - no blood and one of the smoothest shaves ever!!!!!!  I shaved my legs in the shower too!!!I loved the no slip soft-grip handle and it was especially convenient to have the holder suctioned to the wall. The 5 blade curve hugging aspect made shaving my legs in the shower a DOUBLE treat ---One of the closest, smoothest shaves ever, AND I didn\'t have to wash spots of blood out of my sheets the next morning!Marilyn Rondeau    "

The little rubbery fins seem to keep the head moving at a good pace with no problems so far.  It is flat and hugs the skin well and seems to rotate well without difficulty.I will keep using it and testing it, but I am not sure how expensive the replacement blades are- that is often the problem.  So many times the replacement blades are more expensive than the original razor or close to it.The handle was easy to hold on to despite soapy wet hands.  The wall unit  stayed up well so far on my fiberglass shower wall- it has two suction cups which seems a bit better than other ones I have tried with only one.The extra blade pack stores inside which I like, although it has to be cut into with scissors to get at it, so having it in the shower helps to keep track of it, but not for opening when needed.  You have to get out of the shower to open it.All in all I really like this razor so far- I have used it twice on my legs and it has stayed sharp and effective, but I will edit if I can in the future to reflect any changes in my opinion of this as time goes on.

So it came as some surprise that this latest generation really did up the ante a bit from a performance standpoint.  Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven\'t so much as gotten a nick.  I\'ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  While I haven\'t attempted to use the razor without shaving cream, as the claims say you can (I have dry/sensitive skin that I feared would not react well), I will say that I think the skin of my legs gets less dry with this razor and I almost didn\'t need body lotion afterward.The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  The razor comes with a case that I believe is intended to adhere to the wall of your shower, with storage for razor blades, which come individually packaged.  I don\'t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can\'t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.The only downside - and one that isn\'t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.  If only you could use the blade to shave the price!  That said, this product is so good that if you\'re trying to select between comparably priced razors/blades from competitors, I strongly recommend you try this one - I think you\'ll be pleased in every way.

I\'m giving it two stars because I guess it does some things OK, but it\'s really bad, at clipping without the combs. WHen I use it to trim, with one of the attached guides, it does OK. But when I use just the clipper, without the attachments, that damned thing keeps opening up.I have a thick beard, and trim it back until it\'s stubble - which I what I bought this unit for. But the damned thing will open up and pinch my face, about five times, every shave. To use it, I have to pinch down on the head so hard, that my index finger gets fatigued. This thing is garbage! Oh, and the battery does not last long, but I guess that\'s to be expected with AA.If you\'re using this to trim a beard with some height (eg. using one of the attached spacers), it does a reasonable job. But if you\'re looking to shave that beard down to stubble, as I do, look elsewhere. I can\'t believe more people haven\'t run into this issue! I regret the $20 I spent on it, and with Gillette put a fraction of their Marketing budget into R&D. Or maybe some of their execs should actually try using the B.S. products.    "

Going from a 5-blade razor to a 3-blade razor sucked! Though these ones are much, much less expensive, I find myself having to almost shave twice, going over spots the razor missed. Even after my shower I found spots the razor missed. I never had to worry about that with the Embrace.Also, I feel like the blades dull quicker. With the Embrace, I only had to change the blade about every month or so (shaving about 2-3x week) but this cartridge dulls much quicker than that.However, it is nice that any Venus blade fits all styles of razor handles.

It\'s no better than the M3 Power razor I have. The difference in closeness of a shave was minimal to nonexistant, more closely bordering the latter I\'m afraid. On top of which, the new head design renders shaving with the grain, or the downstroke, completely useless. And the detail trimmer on the back of the head is dull and useless right out of the packaging.The single improvement this razor has over the last generation is that the handle of the blade is more comfortable in the hand and balanced better. The downstroke is useless, the upstroke is the shave. The total shave is overall the same except that I can\'t use the downstroke at all anymore. And at the jacked up price they\'re pumping out these beauties at, it\'s not worth anything at all. I\'ll stick with my M3 Power. Sorry Gillette. Your new thing just ain\'t the best a man can get.

It costs about $9. The Gillette Mach3 Cartridges , 8 cartridges cost about $10. Now I\'ve tried this Gillette Fusion Power razor at a cost of about $12 with Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges, 8-Count Package costing about $20.For the extra $3 for the razor, it cannot be beat. Gillette has raised its own bar for excellent shaving. This razor has five blades instead of three, guaranteeing the closest possible shave with several cool features. The blue lubricating strip turns white when the blade reaches the end of its use. It comes with a AAA battery that fits in the ergonomically slip-free grip handle (with a low battery light indicator). This vibrates the five blades at a high rate to ensure a very close shave. The microchip in the handle turns the razor off after eight minutes. Plus, on the back side there is a `precision trimmer\' blade that cuts those sideburns exact and is gentle enough to trim around your moustache, goatee and nose. Gillette claims each disposable blade will last up to a month, but I have found Gillette blades (the three blade version) to last three weeks. So I expect this five blade version to last well past a month. That\'s amazing.The Gillette Fusion handle costs $3 more and the refills (8) cost $10 more, but they last longer and the shave is so much closer. Spend the few extra dollars and get a razor with blades that last longer than any other on the market. I suggest buying in bulk to save money. You do get what you pay for.    "

Cynics of course would find it hard to eulogise over what was obviously just another fad and a rip off.  10 years later the Mach 3 is still VERY highly regarded and widely used even with the coming of the might Fusion Power with a whole two more blades and a built in vibrator to pleasure you even further.I thought I\'d experiment with the Quattro a few years back and I thought it was an improvement on the Mach 3.  I just liked the way it felt and shaved although it didn\'t shave any better than the Mach 3.  I did have one irritation though as it clogged up quite often and it was hard to get clean.  I even used scrubbing brushes to clear it, not always successfully.  I must have liked the razor though as I didn\'t toss it.My Dad was over on holiday and had forgotten his electric razor and was forced to buy a razor.  He happened to get the Fusion Power and he laughed about the five blades and vibrator.  He was soon mightily impressed with it though.  I haven\'t found out though whether he has continued to use it or not.A month ago after the blades for my Quattro were done, I decided to buy this Fusion Power.  I did read the review which were split on whether it shaved any better but everyone, almost, who used it liked it.I bought it and wasn\'t disppointed.  It is a lovely razor to use and the vibrator is novel.I then bought a brand new Mach 3 to compare this Fusion Power with.  I showered then lathered up and did half my face with each one then looked closely.  The shave was pretty much the same for both sides but bear in mind that the blade on the Fusion was a month old!  Mind you both sides felt very smooth although on closer inspection this wasn\'t the case.  It just proved to me that my technique may be a bit average and that you can\'t shave the hairs to the surface of the skin (unlike the simulations you see on TV).I have to say though that the Fusion is one hell of a razor.  It looks so cool and the tactile feel and shape is a big improvement over the Mach 3.  Shaving itself feels much the same though.  I don\'t have a challenging growth though, it is pretty average and I think the most important thing to get a good shave is to shower first.  After a shower you can almost get away with no shaving cream , that\'s how big a difference it makes.Overall in spite of the blades being twice the price almost, I love the fusion.  Gillette have made a product that is a perfect synthesis of engineering genius and marketing passion to produce a truly wonderful prodcut.I hate them of course as they have tempted me to buy a product that is objectively, no better than the Mach 3 but in the final analysis the sex appeal of this fine razor won me over.

With this product, you get extra power; but you have to sacrifice some comfort and convenience to seal the bargain.First, let\'s get the obvious part out of the way: this stuff does a fine job of keeping you dry. In that regard it works as well as any antiperspirant I\'ve tried. Like other \'clinical strength\' products, the directions tell you to apply before bed at night, and explain how the product works by plugging up your pores so the sweat can\'t get out. I can\'t say that sounds too healthy to me, but after using a whole package, I didn\'t get a rash of any kind.Now, the sacrifices: in general, your underarm areas are going to feel weird. They\'ll feel tacky or rubbery to the touch, as though they\'re coated in dried rubber cement, especially for the first few hours after you\'ve applied the product. This might not bother everybody, but I didn\'t like the sensation.Finally, the elaborate packaging has a fatal flaw. You turn a little knob three clicks at a time to meter out the right dosage. The knob gives  satisfying loud click, and the packaging is strong and opaque. There\'s no squeezing or fooling around. But one day, you\'ll turn it one or two clicks and it will simply stop: the product will be all gone, but there will have been no warning. There\'s  just no way to tell when you\'re about to run out; this could leave you in an awkward position on the day of that big presentation...    "

Manual razors, especially disposable ones, are more effective for me, but with my skin as sensitive as it is, I\'m usually decorating my face with little bits of tissue when I\'m through.With this razor, I get the best of all worlds.  With 5 blades, it\'s hard to miss a spot, and it takes less time overall to get the job done.  The vibrating gives it an extra \'kick\' and makes the shave more effective.  The best part is that there is virtually no sign of irritation.For those who are having trouble using this razor against 2- or 3-day-old beards, just be patient and let the razor (and its vibrations) do the work.  Pull your skin so the part you\'re shaving is good and tight and the stubble is separated as much as possible.This razor gives me, by far, the closest shave ever, and with no irritation.    "

I finally switched to a manual razor.PG\'s Gilette sent me both the Fusion and the Mach 3 free, so I tried them both.  I think P&G\'s Gilette is trying to confuse me.  I like the Mach 3 better than the fusion becasue:1) smaller head makes it easier to get into those small places, true the fusion does have the one rear blade for this prupose but the head was so large that I was not able to get the blade into those hard places.  The Mach 3 was able to get the whole head into most of the small places which certainly beats getting just the one blade in there.2) While the Fusion\'s handle was well balanced so was the Mach 3\'s handle and the Mach 3 had better gripping surface then the Fusion did.3) Lower price on the Mach 3, IMHO, means that the Mach does not need to beat the Fusion just get close to it.  In my test the Mach 3 did better than the Fusion.In terms of the question that I posed in my title, as with everything else in life which is better for you depends on what type of beard you have.  Do you have a heavy beard and have to shave multiple times a day(like Tip O\'Niel) or are you a teen, then the Fusion is probably the best thing for you.  Do you have a moderate beard?  The the Mach 3 is probably more what you need.  Or if you have a light one that does not grow very fast, like mine, then the Sensor or the Sensor Excell is more of what you need.  I think that I am going to go for the Mach 3.I stuck with the electric razors for years thinking that the manual razors would nick and irritate my face.  The may have been true thirty years ago but not now.  Electric razors don\'t give you anywhere near as close a shave as a manual does.As for shaving gell goes, save your dollars and buy the Barbasoll brand.  Costs less and is much better than the Gillete Fusion gells.    "

2685,2769,20110322,B004QE83VE,2,"March 22, 2011",A1VABWDOUQLULZ,Don\'t buy the hype,"I\'ve used razors in the Venus line off and on for years, as well as other brands that have built-in moisturizers, so I was curious when I saw Gillette had created the \'Pro Skin\' razor.  There are two cartridges in the package, along with the razor handle and suction shower hook.  The hook fastened well to my glass shower, and has clung since without problem.  The tortoise shell packaging has an easy-open flap in the back, which is nice.  I find the individual packaging of the cartridges a bit overkill, but I\'m not a big fan of packaging, in general.The cartridges slip onto the handle easily enough.  I noticed right away that the installed cartridge is a bit bulky. After dampening it, I found the blades were quite sharp, leaving a smooth, close shave.  My dislike of the Pro Skin razor is that it doesn\'t shave curved areas well, because it\'s so bulky you can\'t shave tight areas, and the gel bars drooled.  They were kind of gross, actually, and dripped down the handle of the razor.  That said, the gel bars left my skin soft and feeling as if I\'d put on lotion.  If you don\'t enjoy that sensation, these razor won\'t be your favorite.  By the time I had completed shaving the bars had worn down quite visibly.  I expect the Pro Skin will suffer the fate of other such inventions, which is the bars will wear down far in advance of the blades becoming dull.  Also, I can\'t imagine storing the razor any way other than on the shower hook.  It would leave a terrible mess laying flat.In short, it does a great job shaving, but for the mess and bulk of the gel bars I won\'t be running out to buy one.  If you need a smaller razor, stick to the original Venus.  If you need a moisturizing razor, spend the extra $4 and get the Intuition.    "

It shaves really smooth and I have yet to nick or cut myself with it. My only complaint is that the razor can be a little messy with the moisture bar as it has a tendency to get gooey and slimy while using it. I\'m always sure to rinse it off good and give it a really good shake before I put it away to make sure it\'s mostly dried off. I don\'t store the razor in the shower where the water will hit it constantly or it would eat away the moisture bar in no time. I shave my legs every other day and this razor seems to do a really good job at shaving close and keeping my legs looking good for the time between shaving. Overall, I\'m happy with this razor and might even buy some refills on my own when I\'m done using up what came with the razor.    "

On the plus side it really hugs your face, shaves cleanly with a single pass, and doesn\'t nick or abrade the skin. Even the edges under the jaw line came clean. I hate shaving and often skip weekends yet find that it works quite well on one, two, or even three day\'s worth of growth. Haven\'t gone longer than that so I couldn\'t say for sure but seems like it\'d do okay for another day or two. Any longer and it would take a pass with an electric trimmer to shorten things up first. The handle is nicely ergonomic too, easy to grip and control when wet. On the minus side the single trim blade doesn\'t work horribly well, at least not for me. I\'ve got to even up my sideburns and trim around my goatee and this just doesn\'t do the trick. Considering what they cost, the blades don\'t last as long as I\'d like either. I\'ve used it regularly for about three weeks and it\'s just starting to dull enough to consider changing the blade. Might be able to stretch it another week but that might be pushing it. Considering that I can go a year with an electric model (Braun) on a single blade/screen set I\'d think they could make a manual that lasts more than a month...Despite the downside, it\'s the best manual razor I\'ve used so far. Quick, clean, comfortable shave... Got one as a free promotion and liked it enough to pick up a pack of refill cartridges. They are a bit pricey but not overmuch. I expect to continue using it for some time to come.   "

790,816,20060923,B000BUW8WM,5,"September 23, 2006",A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,Best shaver I\'ve ever had.,"I\'m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I\'ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I\'ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I\'ve finally found the right one.I\'ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They\'ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn\'t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don\'t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I\'d have a five-o\'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it\'s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I\'ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.    "

It\'s amazing how few razors meet this criteria. The new unpowered Gillette Fusion razor does this better than the older Gillette model it replaced.For me, my beard tends to outgrow razors. I can live with one for a few years and then, suddenly, I find it no longer gives me a close shave. That\'s when I know it\'s time to change.What\'s different with Fusion is I need hardly any effort to remove facial hair and don\'t need much pressure from the hand or wrist. Just get the thing on my face and move it and it does the job even on my chin, under my nose, off my jawbone and in those other spots where lines are hardly flat or straight. The razor has another cutting edge on the back you can use for straight cuts to sideburns or elsewhere,  if you choose.I cut myself a few times the first time I used Fusion and was concerned the five cutting edges may be too much for me. But I quickly adjusted by releasing the pressure in my shaving hand and now take a close shave sans cuts for granted every morning of my life.Ergo, this razor meets my only criteria expertly. I\'d recommend this product to anyone that wants what I want, a close shave without cuts.    "

The fancier ones not only cost more but they are mostly useless when the moisture bar runs out, even if the blades are still sharp. Just use decent shaving lotion and you should have no problems with this razor. Sometimes simpler is better.I normally buy these at the store, but they were cheaper on amazon so I now purchase them here.I am giving it 4 stars, although it is better than the $18-22 price in stores, the $16 price on amazon is still way to high for the product.

It\'s wide enough for a huge underarm so a lot was wasted as the product cannot be rolled back down. It does work, I loved the way it didn\'t let me get wet at all.  But, I think I know the reason for that. I don\'t know what the deodorant has in it but after about the third day I had it on, I noticed that at the end of the day my underarms were sticky....hard sticky. That night in the shower I couldn\'t get it off.  The only thing I can akin it to is the feeling that 80\'s fry-baby might have now. The sticky that comes from not removing all of the grease from the outside of the baby.  Just sticky.  I quit using it then.  Even after repeated washings with my hand and a washrag, it took me another two days to get it from under my arm.  I gave it to my husband to use and he hasn\'t complained.

In theory, it\'s a great idea: it\'s difficult to get sharp symmetrical lines using an ordinary razor, and one would think a single blade would do the trick a lot better. In practice, though, this doesn\'t work. In the first place, either the blade isn\'t sharp enough or it\'s burried too deep inside the cartridge to be truly precise. And secondly, whatever hairs it trims just get stuck in the blade - and it\'s a real pain to get them out.The good. Fusion isn\'t worse than Mach3. This was actually a great relief following the disappointment of M3Power which was a disaster. I can\'t say yet if Fusion gives a superior shave to Mach3 Turbo, but it stands to reason that five blades would perform better than three.    "

I happened to have a Venus Vibrance (which has three blades) in my shower, so I tried the Embrace on one leg and the Vibrance on the other. (I did not turn on the vibration on the Vibrance, because I have never found it to make any difference and because I felt it might skew the experiment.) I put a new blade on the Vibrance, so that both razors were starting out on as level a playing field as possible.There was very little noticeable difference in performance. Both razors shaved my legs smoothly. The only drawback to the Embrace is that it has a slightly larger head, which makes it a little difficult to maneuver around knees and other tricky areas. I saw no difference in closeness of shave between the three and the five-bladed razors; and a few days later, I saw no difference in the amount of stubble.Overall, I\'d say that if you are a first-time Venus buyer, the Embrace is a fine choice; but if you already have a Venus razor, the Embrace really isn\'t an upgrade, and there\'s no reason to buy it.

There are 5 blades, all parallel to each other, which is the secret to the close shave. Each blade is sharper than the one above it. The first blade, which is the least sharp, functions to pull the hair out of the follicle a bit, then the second blade cuts the hair and pulls on it some more, then the third blade cuts some more and pulls the hair out even further. Finally, before the hair can snap back, the fourth blade moves in, and cuts the wily hair to infinity. My theory is that the fifth blade is just a marketing ploy and it really doesn\'t do anything. So, if you are willing to spend the money for the closest shave ever, buy this product. Or, if you are out of work because of the economy, you should get a Bic razor from Wal Mart.    "

The pod has suction cups that allows it to be placed in the shower - without taking up precious space for my other necessary beauty products.  I placed the pod on one wall of my shower three weeks ago and it is still firmly in place.

It is similar to the Embrace Venus razor, but the Embrace has rubberized strips that make the blades float above the skin.  The Venus Spa Breeze Razor has two strips of very hard milled soap on the top and bottom so that you do not have to use soap or shaving cream/lotion when you shave.The soap is not overly scented.  It is not overly lathery either, which surprised me.  It is quite solid and does not melt easily, which is good because you won\'t blow through the soap before you finish the razor in sharpness.The soap does have sodium lauryl sulfate (and some relatives) in it which I avoid in my skin care products, but it is not a large amount and it did not leave my skin parched when I got done using it.The storage rack that comes with the Spa Breeze Razor is nice but I don\'t like the way it attaches to the wall.  It has two square adhesive strips that you are supposed to attach to a clean shower wall and then hang the case up on it with little knobs that hook it in.  I don\'t like that idea- there is too much risk of sticky being left behind being yet another challenge in cleaning the walls of the shower once it has lived through its usefulness and has to be removed.I have given this four stars because of the case mounting idea, and the fact that I don\'t like this razor quite as much as the EMBRACE by Venus.  The EMBRACE seems to shave closer and more easily than the Spa Breeze Razor.    "

2655,2736,20110421,B004QE83VE,2,"April 21, 2011",AUITG1DJ3QUGK,"better than many disposables, with some caveats","I have reviewed a number of products which I tried because my teenaged daughter wanted them and I had concerns... and so used myself as a test subject.  In this case, it is somewhat reversed.  She has been using Venus razors for some time; absolutely insists on them to my dismay, as they are a good deal more expensive than any other disposable razor that I am aware of.  So, when the opportunity presented itself I decided to try it and see why she was so wholly sold on the product.I will preface my remarks on this razor by noting that I have so butchered myself with disposable razors in the past that I gave them up entirely for electric (which, I will note, are a good deal better than they used to be).  That said, for me this trial serves several purposes.1. How likely was I (or she) to cut myself with it?2. Did it provide a better shave than an electric?3. how does it compare to other disposables?I put off the test for quite a bit reminiscing on discovering a trail of blood as I left the bathroom (and having sworn the entire routine off years ago).It did pass the crucial first test.  I managed to shave my legs without bloodying myself.  I think the moisturizing pad helped here.  that said, I *really* do not like the moisturizer.  It smells like fabric softener to me :p and does not feel as good as either a real moisturizer (which you would use after you shave) or provide as much glide as other creams or gels.  I found it mildly offensive.  that took a star off.2. Compared to the electric, it was not as easy to use; involved a bit more fussing: insert (or, as one will ultimately have to) changing the blade.  It was a little bit of a closer shave, but also left my legs feeling scraped.... not as good as my skin felt on the leg I did with the electric (knock off one more star).3. Compared to other disposables, it is not any closer per se but may save one pass.  HOWEVER, the blades get much more clogged and are more difficult to clean than twin blade razors.When you think about it, really it is just one blade which is doing the cutting, the second or third is for what you miss on the first pass.Having tried it, do I think it is worth the extra cost?  NO (resoundingly) but sincerely doubt I will be able to reason with her ;)In sum, yes it shaves a bit closer than an electric.  All blade razors do.I found this one to be safer than most (a plus) but did not like the scent or feel of the moisturizer and my skin felt more raw than when I use the electric.I did not find that it provided a closer shave than other disposables, or permanent blade razors, and do find it harder to clean.In my view the positives and negatives more or less balance each other out and what you are left with is a very expensive disposable.  Myself, I will not be buying this product, though doubt my reasoning will have much impact on the shopping habits of my teenager ;)Edited to note that I brought this with me on vacation (more portable than an electric) and a week later have so many ingrown hairs; it\'s awful!  This never happened with any other razor I have used.  I will not be using it again (and will seriously discourage my daughter from same).  Who wants to risk infections or scars?  I don\'t!    "

For someone who dreads shaving because every excursion results in a bloody nick, this razor changed my view entirely.The handle attaches to the head at the bottom, leaving the head to swivel naturally with each body curve.  Most razors have the handle attaching at the top of the razor so mobility is limited.For the first time since I started shaving my legs, I did not come away with nicks, cuts, or scrapes.  The multiple blade head seems to float over the turns and curves of the body and gives a close shave with little pressure.I also liked the enclosed shower pod which holds the additional blades and keeps them dry yet handy.  Nothing worse than having to leave the shower to get a new razor.  The pod has stuck in its original place so I haven\'t had problems with it falling off the tile as have other reviewers.Overall, there isn\'t anything I can say that I didn\'t like.  So, for women who have tried waxing, lotions, or other razors, give this a try.  I don\'t think you\'ll be disappointed.  No fuss, straight forward and no PAIN!    "

I don\'t want to smell like my deodorant, and the Cool Wave fragrance is very subtle. Also, my wife likes the smell, so that is an obvious plus!3) It seems to last longer than other brands including other gels. I tried AXE but found their clear gel to take more layers of application to work with the same effectiveness as Gillette.4) It doesn\'t degrade or melt when taken around in a gym bag. Over time some of the other gels I\'ve bought lose their texture or melt if they\'re not kept cool enough. I don\'t have that problem with Gillette. I can take it to the gym, leave it in my gym bag in a hot car all day long, and it still works perfectly later.Amazon sells these for a very reasonable price compared even with a place like SAMS, so if you like this deodorant, stock up and save some money.

I thought that this one would be an improvement and I was excited about getting the pro glide version. Like a dummy I didn\'t test it first and got the bulk set from Costco.This is by far the worst razor ever. There was no gliding at all, it was more like grinding. It irritated the hell out of my skin and it was the most uncomfortable shave ever. It felt as if it was pulling each hair out of my face and I was bleeding everywhere. At first I thought that OK maybe its was this specific blade I was using so I got another blade, the same. The next morning I pulled out  an old unused single blade disposable I had for emergencies and it was much more comfortable then this one. I absolutely hate this razor, I ended up giving away the other unused blades. I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor. Felt great. Best shave ever. This did everyting that the Pro glide promised to do. I had no irritation of the skin and the shave was very comfortable and close.I would NOT recommend this razor at all. I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I thought that this was supposed to the best for sensitive skin...WRONG.Do yourself a favor and don\'t spend you money on this overpriced crap.

The 5 blades also feel totally safe. As a matter of fact they do what is advertised and feel like they actually adjust to the contours of the skin.

I mean, my triple-bladed beast was still cranking along, and after 15+ years, I\'ve become accustomed to having my facial hair more pulled out than cut.  It\'s a genentic thing not many people seem to suffer from, which is good for the greater population.  Put it this way, I have \'5 o-clock shadow by 10 AM\'.  It\'s not a good thing.  If I skip shaving for 36 hours, I start to look like a psycho-drifter who has been on the road for a few weeks.Anyway, I sprung for the powered version, figuring I could use all the help I could get.  Shockingly, no pun intended, the shave was not only *amazingly* close, but I didn\'t have the typical 2-5 cuts from having a new blade.  To make matters better, I mananged to have even sideburns for a change.I\'ve been in Vegas about a year and the mid-to-late-70\'s fat Elvis has started to transchannel my sideburns.  Not mutton-chops...yet, but they\'re obvious.  ;-)Anyway, after not my first, but third powered-Fusion shave, about six hours after shaving (at which point I\'d ususally give my wife a rash if I gave her more than a peck on the cheek) I said to her, \'hey, feel my chin.\'  I got an immediate \'WOW!\'  It\'s so nice to look normal for an entire day.There are downsides.  Blades are stupidly expensive and don\'t seem to last more than a week, but the behavior was similar with my Mach III.  I\'ve considered having a ton of cartridges treated with near absolute zero cold, as that appears to help longevity, but have never gotten around to it.    "

The trimmer is single blade and not very useful. 2) Different blade design means you can\'t use M3 blades.  For several generations in the past, you could have used the previous blades. 3) Shave similar to M3 (see above).    "

At this price you can\'t find a better quality trimmer let alone a razor as well. No cheapo plastic. It has a little weight to it and the rubberized grip feels great in your hand. The snap on combs aren\'t made of brittle plastic and have a bit of flex. The base that holds it all is well designed to actually hold everything securely. The trimmer works well and didn\'t pull any hairs on my beard and the fusion razor is well... a fusion razor. We\'ll see how it stands the test of time. Finally a trimmer that won\'t sit on the shelf. Well worth the price.

I purchased a Gillette Fusion razor with a $4 off coupon out of the Sunday news, and that gave me the razor for about $1 after the in-store rebate.This is easily the best razor I have ever owned/used.  One pull of the razor across my face makes the skin unbelievably smooth.  I won\'t be switching to anything else after buying this product.TIPS:Don\'t throw the cartridges out after the aloe \'indicator\' strip fades - that thing is useless junk added on to make you replace the blades more often than is necessary.  Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies.  The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing.  They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry.  I can get more than a month of shaves out of a single cartridge before the blades dull and start to nick or pull at the skin.  Buying a 12-pack of blades lasts me longer than a year . . .    "

The shape was easy to hold (unlike some other high-end women\'s razors I\'ve purchased in the past that had hard shapes to hold).The package I received came with what Gilette is calling a \'shower pod\' which is a holder for the razor and some refill cartridges that has suction cups that you can stick to your shower wall. It is convenient to hang it on the shower wall. It stuck to the smooth surface of my ceramic tile well.The refill cartridges come in sealed plastic packages so they can be stored in the shower, inside the shower pod, without rusting or getting the aloe vera strip worn down from water.To sum it up, it gave a great shave, the shower pod was convenient and the sealed refills are very practical.I have no complaints!

The razor works fine without the power feature which vibrates the blade.  At first, I liked the power feature and used it for about one week, but then I just found it a bit annoying and haven\'t used it since then.  The power feature actually slows you down a bit as you cant rush the blade over your stubble as I have become used to doing after a hot shower in the morning.  I can tell that using 5 blades gives me a slightly closer shave than my previous razor with 3 blades (the mach 3) but I honestly don\'t care about the slight difference.  Hence I have come to the conclusion that this is not much of an advance in shaving technology, in a strange way, it is actually a step backwards as the prices of blades have gone up without a real noticeable enhancement in my shave.  I am glad that they haven\'t stopped making my previous blades and will likely switch back to those after I have used up all of my fusion blades.    "

It is a perfectly fine razor once you get used to maneuvering the rather large head in tight spaces, like around your nose.For the first couple days, I shaved half my face with the old and the other half with the new and really couldn\'t see/feel much of a difference.  I continued to use the new one for about 3 weeks and then went back to the SENSOR.  It shaves every bit a well as the newer one and for about one third the cost for the new blades.  I rue the day when they stop making these blades.  This seems to be in the planning stages as they are now encouraging people to not buy MACH3 and switch to Proglide.

So what you are left with is a razor with NO lubrication, and you end up having to use soap or shaving cream anyway if you want to get the full life out of your blade.

And to my surprise the lubricating feature on the Turbo actually works! A great product.One more word of advice - keep your eye on the price of this item as it fluctuates often! Keep it in your shopping cart and buy when the price drops. I paid $1.83 per blade. Great deal.Once again... ships and sold by Amazon... VERY important!!!    "

I really didn\'t think this Gillette Fusion Proglide upgrade would be much of an improvement, but to my surprise it was.  I found the razor actually gave a better shave than my previous Gillette provided.The new Proglide is smooth and did the job without punishing my face.  I can shave in the shower without a mirror and the razor glides gently over my face without missing a spot or nicking my skin. If there is one downside to using Gillette Fusion razors it would be the high cost of replacement blades. I suppose one must pay the price for quality and inovation.The new Fusion has a feature that my previous one didn\'t.  The on/off switch is lighted.  OK, that is no big deal, but I really appreciate it because my nearsighted eyes can easily locate the switch to turn off the razor.I recommend buying the Gillette Fusion Proglide even if you already have a previous model of the Fusion.

Could the Fusion be that much better than the Mach 3?  Was it worth spending $10 on?  In short answer YES!!!The FUSION follows every curve on your face like an Ariel Atom sticks to every curve and corner on the race track....The MACH 3 on the other hand feels live a Ford Festiva going around your face on 4 donut spare tires.Where the MACH 3 leaves short hairs for the 2nd pass the FUSION annihilates them in 1 pass.Where the MACH 3 lets your face feel like you need to shave again right after your done the Fusion turns your face into a smooth sheet of glass.My last point is that you need to invest in the Fusion cream (or some high end cream). This is the biggest problem  people skimp on the cream and don\'t get the best results.

The difference between the two -- the \'microcomb\' at the edge of the Power\'s cartridge, which allegedly exists to \'help guide the hair to the blades,\' seems like a silly concept to me.  Then again, I\'m a daily shaver and my hair isn\'t so long after one day that it needs to be \'guided\' into the razor blade.  :)I do like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave.  I never get nicked or scratched when using a Fusion blade unless I\'ve been using it too long; the first nick is a sign that the blade is dull and needs to be replaced, which sometimes happens before the lubricating strip indicates a replacement is warranted.  I get about two week\'s worth of shaves out of each cartridge and don\'t do anything special to try to prolong their life.    "

If you want to use the trimmer to do some edging, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. It\'s not powerful enough to do edging. It works fine trimming with each of the combs, but edging is out. My 20 year old Con-air trimmer does better due to more power (2 AA batteries as opposed to 1 AA battery for the styler). And the replacement cartridges prices are insane, although you can get the 6 cartridge replacement from Amazon for cheaper than you can a 4 cartridge replacement at any store. I suggest buying the fusion proglide razor instead of the 3-in-1 trimmer. Not worth the money for the trimmer    "

Don\'t even think about buying blades and storing them -- at least they don\'t work that well in the tropics.  I\'ve found the conditioning strips began melting on my unused blades and sometimes even causing rust on the blade.  My experience with this razor is bittersweet, it is probably the best razor on the market but cost of blades will do you in quickly.I can\'t wait for the next iteration of this series, although by then I might move on to an electric shaver.  Basically don\'t believe the advertising -- a shave that close will probably only happen once with a fresh blade, and if you have thick hair it may also give you a little nick to get it.    "

Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse, she\'s one of those people that reads the manual on everything first, never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging (which she usually copies down in the store).I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present, but that\'s a whole other story. Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice. The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price. This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you\'re only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her, which she thinks is a must. Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The \'ease of use\' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter. Easier than oral, rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data, and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep, which caused my wife to scowl and panic, but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself. Sure, you can go to Target or Wal-Maze and buy yourself another cheapie, but then you\'ll be back exactly where you are now sometime later ... looking for a dependable and accurate ear Thermometer.This is currently the best.

However, this razor is absolutely wonderful.  I shaved my entire body except for my head and torso and it gave a close shave.  First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  However, once you power it on, the vibration allows it to glide smoothly over your body.  When I shave with my normal razors I always get pin hole knicks all over my body (about 8-15) and come out of the shower bleeding. With this razor, I only had one knick--simply amazing. Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.I also had my boyfriend try it and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily but he could get use to that.

We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs.

Despite their abundantly mass-produced stock, they have been well-built (some more than others) and have stood the test of time.  These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I\'m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  While Gillette\'s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  Where I know some bumps on my cheeks and chin should be, the vibration may confuse me and cause me to improperly shave and leave some spots thicker than others.The blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I\'m considering doing the ol\'-fashioned wet shaving.All in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.

There has always been some kind of trade-off between closeness, irritation, tendency to produce ingrown hairs, price, and speed of use.  I never understood how my friends and family members were able to achieve a close and fast shave on a regular basis, while I would shave twice as slowly and get a shave half as good as theirs. I\'ve tried manual razors, electric foil razors, and electric rotary razors.  I had settled on manual razors (only shaving with the grain) because it produced the least irritation and didn\'t leave patches of uncut hairs like all the electric ones I\'ve tried.  Unfortunately, due to my pattern of beard growth, manual razors tended to leave me with ingrown hairs all along my jawline, despite my best efforts to prevent them.  I had figured that I had to settle for dealing with them until now.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best of the manual and electric shaving worlds.

Pros:Handle is weighted well.Very close shave.Less irritation than previous generations, even against grain.Extra blade on back=worth it.Cons:5 blades get gunked up quickly, requiring more passes.Long surface area (of blade) takes some getting used to.Expensive; not compatible with Mach3 system.Update:Down to 2-3 Stars.Used the razor for about two weeks and found that it did not function as well as the Mach3. If you are not an everyday shaver (sometimes I don\'t shave on the weekends or holiday breaks) you will suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth of growth. Also, I found that I simply wasn\'t getting as close a shave as I did with the Mach3, even when shaving every day. I agree that there was less irritation, but only slightly so. I do miss the sideburn blade and the heft of the handle, but I\'m happy that I returned it and purchased more blades from my Mach 3 Power instead--for me, at least, this wasn\'t an improvement.   "
546,566,20061115,B000BUUVTE,4,"November 15, 2006",AOMMNU2TZ67WY,A review from a \'beginner\',"First let me qualify myself as someone who last used a non-electric razor when I was 18...over 25 years ago. Thus the beginner tag. I stopped using a bladed razor because of cuts. For years I kind of accepted an average shave from electric razors because I just knew a blade would cut my face. I even grew a goatee because I could not get a clean shave on my chin. About two weeks ago I received an unsolicited free Gillette Fusion in the mail. I just sat it on my desk and figured I would toss it out eventually. Something inside told me to \'research\' it on the Net. I did and decided to give it a whack come Monday morning (Nov. 6). After perusing these reviews I decided to not buy the Fusion gels. I instead bought the Face Scrub, Shaving Gel and Post Shave Lotion of the Neutrogena Men, Razor Defense line. Let\'s just say I did not know I needed a Face Scrub product. :-)With some trepedition I went ahead with my \'test.\' I could not believe how gently the Fusion glided across my face. And, just as importantly, what an improvement over my electric razor. I honestly do not think I could cut myself if I tried. Okay, of course I could. :-)I recommend this razor. I have not used Mach3, Sensor, etc. so I can\'t say it is better or worse. But I like it.P.S. The cartridges are, of course, overpriced.    "
1596,1648,20090422,B001JQLNFA,4,"April 22, 2009",A2OJCTT5WLB2HR,A Pretty Good Razor,"I have to say, I was hesitant with this product.  I was pretty much convinced it wouldn\'t work well.  I thought the shave gel strips would make the razor not shave close or that the shave gel strips wouldn\'t really be able to take the place of shave gel.  Then, I gave it a shot.  Wow!  The shave gel strips are quite effective and the razor shaved as close as any razor without the strips.  On purpose, I didn\'t use lotion or anything after shaving my legs to see if there would be any kind of razor burn from not using a shave cream, soap, etc.  Nothing!The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was due to what you get for the price.  The package says it is a one count, but goes on to say there are two of the head pieces included.  In other razors, this would typically mean there is one full razor (handle and head piece) and two refill head pieces.  On this, you get one handle and two head pieces.  At $10.99 a package, that makes these $5.50 each which is pretty pricey for a ladies razor.  I\'m also a little concerned that the life of the razor might be short because once the strips are gone, it is just a plain razor.  I\'ll have to update to let everyone know how long the strips lasted.UPDATEUnfortunately, this razor didn\'t stand the test of time.  The first shave was great.  The second was okay, but the strips were drying up.  On the third shave, one of the now dried up strips fell off.  On the second razor in the pack, it lasted about five shaves before one of the strips fell off.  So, I can\'t recommend this product.    "

I was hesitant to buy the proglide since I knew it was just an \'improved\' version of the fusion. I figured this was just an attempt to sell us something all us fusion owners already had and my suspicion was furthered by other reviews posted here, which said the proglide was not much of an improvement over the fusion. But I decided to try it as I love new toys and though I really like the fusion I don\'t think it is perfect as occasionally it does give me razor burn. So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion. I don\'t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced. Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn\'t think it was perfect. But the proglide is so good I\'m not sure what the next step in shaving evolution will be as I feel this is as good as it gets. Definitely worth the $11 or so to switch from the fusion    "

The head of the razer on the fusion is larger than the mach 3. Blade on the fusion not interchangable like the mach 3, mach turbo, m3 turbo, mach nitro.

My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I\'d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I\'ve noticed, however, that it doesn\'t take that long before the shave isn\'t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.

I will also say that my beard typically comes in patchy and the hair on my face is usually pretty coarse.  Everyone\'s face is different and this should be taken into consideration.  This razor feels very comfortable in my hand and perhaps even lighter than most razors.  Traditionally, I have shyed away from Gillette razors as they have a tendency to provide a more painful shave for me.  There seems to be more tugging and pulling then other razors I have used.  I have always found that a Schick Titanium typically gives me a more comfortable shave.  The Proglide is no exception as I still found it to be pulling a bit much to my disappointment.  I also noticed a bit more irritation on my face the next day, but nothing too bad.  However, I will say that this is, by far, the closest shave I have ever had with any razor.  I believe I actually said \'wow\' when I was done shaving.  In my mind I had to determine what the trade off was.  More comfortable versus closest shave.  For now, I am sticking with the Gillette in hopes that my face gets a little more used to it.I knocked off two stars for the following reasons:1) Price!  The razor is not too expensive, but a 4 pack of blades is about $16 at my local gorcery store.

In less than a minute, I had the case open and the razor up in the bathroom.But styling aside, is it better than a razor with only two blades?  The moisture added around the head is more effective, maybe even a tad oily. I didn\'t find the extra blades to make it any more efficient. I still gave it four stars because it does what it should and it doesn\'t have any glaring faults.**** EDIT: After using this for some time I have come to the conclusion that it is far better than a razor with only two blades.  It cuts shaving time.  And over time, I\'ve found that I have to shave less.  Due to having to take fewer swipes with the blade, I\'ve also found that my skin isn\'t as irritated.  I have fewer and less visible razor bumps/stubble. I haven\'t even had to change blades yet. I\'ve been using just plain cold water to shave and my skin also feels very moisturized.

The shave cannot leave spotty stubble, and the blade can\'t dull after 2-3 attempts either.These Fusions are the best blades I\'ve used for the task. I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face. The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.Even with a week\'s growth on the head, the blade is up to it (granted, I\'m pretty bald, so we\'re not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here). It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that\'s needed.The one flaw is not the blade\'s fault - but it\'s still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you\'re using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.I\'ve cut myself quite a few times, usually on the fingers when I\'m switching hands, or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick. It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot. It can be the kind of cut you\'ll actually need to pay attention too.Other blades can cut too, of course, but this razor\'s series of blades will make it quite a bit worse. If it was just my face, I probably wouldn\'t make the mistake, but since I\'m shaving my head I can\'t always see what I\'m doing, and that can be the problem. I\'ve never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.That is not the blade\'s fault - it\'s mine! But I can\'t imagine I\'m the only one whose done this. I know we\'re all careful with blades, but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.But - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised. If you need a clean shave for thick stubble, this should work for you.    "

That is proof of the pudding with their Gilette Fusion Proglide Power razor, and their refill cartridges. While the concept is right with the closeness of a shave, the big gripe about it is that the cartridges quickly get dull only after a few uses. That dullness gets very tiresome, even with the toughest of shaving creams and mixes to make it easier for your best shave.

It\'s sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.  I\'ll say this, it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  When I\'ve waited a few days before using, the Proglide is a dream.  It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  Sadly, I\'ve noticed that if I shave two days in a row my skin gets irritated and the shave is nowhere near as close.  I know that some consider the battery operated vibration to be a mere gimmick, but having used a razor with the same capability for years I have found that my shave is always closer WITH the vibration, and I\'m quick to replace the battery because of that.  Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it\'s worth it (as far as I\'m concerned).  When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.  All in all, I like this product.  It delivers most of the time; I just wish it were always.    "

If you hardly have any hair, you probably don\'t really need it.i have tried ***ALL*** the Venus collection and many others, so take it from a pro!!! i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far. First it covers a much larger area so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors. A few strokes and you\'re done. i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!! i read a reviewer\'s comment saying that Embrace is the same as a 1 blade razor. NO WAY!! this one doesn\'t even compare to the one with 3 blades!!it is so practical, you don\'t need to go over the same area more than once or twice. the smoothing \'bands\' (meant for exfoliation i suppose) seem to assist the shaving because they smoothe the area perfectly. i was TOTALLY IMPRESSED with this one. The head is very flexible so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts. i have a sensitive skin but it is hard to cut yourself with this one - unless you overdo it or if you have very little hair. You don\'t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).i read a review by a man who uses this razor, well i use men\'s foam! i DON\'T use the foaming gels made for women. they foam much less than men\'s products. i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target\'s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper prices.i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product.

But upon using the 5 blade wonder from Gillette I quickly found that the hype was worthwhile and the end result was the greatest shave I had ever gotten.

It was only a matter of time before a womens razor with 5 blades would be released, could the magic happen again?You bet it could.Being in martial arts I found the benefits of shaving areas that men don\'t usually shave as opposed to staying hairy all over (go ahead and insert your metro sexual jokes here) and have used a womens razor for years so I know what I am talking about.  With the edition of the lubricant outer edge, the aforementioned 5 blades, a comfortable grip and a shaving station to put your razor back, this newest invention by Gillette truly is a work of art.  Razor burn is a thing of the past and irritation has been sent out to pasture as well.

I have used high end brands like Clinique. I used an organic brand, the name of which I do not remember because it was a long time ago, that gave me a rash. I have even used a lower priced brand like Barbasol. In the end I can say that every one allowed me to shave well. The Hydra Gel that I am currently use really allows the blades of my Fusion razor to smoothly glide over my face. Another plus is that I only use a drop. I drop the size of a dime is plenty to generate a nice lather on one side of my face. So, basically, 3 dime size gel drop will get the whole face covered in a great lather. One can should last me a couple of months I assume. If I use too much my face tends to be left with kind of a film on it from the gel. It comes off easily but you really need to wash your face thoroughly.Less is better.My face has a close shave, no rashes, no bumps. It is a wonderful product.    "

Now, this one has a solid soap on top and bottom of the razor blades, to take the place of your shaving cream.  I thought this would be good.I haven\'t cut my legs while shaving for probably 10 years...until today, when I used this razor.  Because the head is very wide (to contain the soap strips), it is difficult to see if you\'re actually cutting the hairs short enough, or maybe you\'re just cutting them \'shorter\' but not shaving them down to the skin.  I found myself pressing very hard to make sure the razor blades would reach the skin, and unfortunately, four times they not only reached the skin but went below it.I won\'t be using the Spa Breeze again.  But maybe this is just me.    "

I packaged up the entire original package as new, including the box, original receipt, and the cheesy complaint card you are entitled to write as per their refund guidelines. It cost me $12 to send all of this. Months later (seriously - like 2 1/2 months later!)they sent me back a letter & my receipt claiming that they cannot fulfill my request because I \'did not include the UPC code\'. The UPC code was on their packing!!! I sent it all back like new!!! More than they asked for!!!So - not only did I waste my time and an additional $12...but Gillette is wasting resources mailing this joke back to me...hence their costly product.I attribute this little event to Gilette not caring for my original review here on Amazon (below)...Hey America! Are why are we falling for this? Surely there are more of you who have noticed this disturbing trend of late?I am of Italian heritage with a heavy beard - I shave more whiskers in one stroke than most peach-fuzz Caucasians shave in a whole week...So if I don\'t need all these blades & tacky gimmicks - then no one does.All anyone requires is the original twin blade Sensor - loud, proud & simple. Easy to use with well-balanced quality. That was the Gillette I stuck with for many years. The Sensor was not impossibly wide/no annoying rubber fins/no vibrations/no batteries/no hype.This gimmicky, bulky, and overpriced nightmare fails to last any longer than a simple Sensor twin blade - here\'s why:The 5 blades here work well for the open expanse areas of the face...great. But they are way too wide to get at any tight spots like under your nose, upper lip, or any side-burn/mustache trimming. Gillette\'s solution is to flip over to a single trimming blade on the back. But here is where this entire concept fails: now we are down to the use & life of just this one blade!Get it?Once this one \'trimming\' blade is dull, the whole $3.00+ blade goes in the garbage!So really - it does not last any longer than a twin blade! With the old Sensor, we had the advantage of two blades hitting all the tight spots.And then there is this useless & goofy \'power\' business. So now, not only are we being forced to fork over $3.00+ per blade...but now we also have to start buying batteries. Gillette\'s stance on the environment? Well evidently their position is to now have millions more batteries going into our landfills. Lovely.And yes, Gillette is clearly bullying the marketplace as we longtime loyal customers can no longer find our favorites in the stores. And if we do - they are now priced double of what they were just a few short years ago. In fact, last time I found my Sensors at Walmart - there was a big sticker on the box asking the customer to call a 1-800 number to inform them if we \'see this product being sold elsewhere\'!! So much for competition and the free market economy!I remember everyone used to just go into the shaving aisle at the stores, grab their fave blades and leave. Now these aisles are full of price-shocked guys standing around scratching their heads, wondering what to do.OK, I understand that Gillette cannot effectively inventory all the retailers with every generation of product they ever made. I also believe in the evolution and optional availability of an evolved product. But give us the option of buying a simple twin blade at an affordable price and keep it readily available. But here Gillette has us over the barrel and is literally forcing everyone to pay a premium for what many of us do not believe is any better (in fact - annoyingly worse).If not, then I would say that this is an opportune time for the competition like Wilkinson Sword to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price. They would clean house. Unfortunately, I myself have not experimented much with the competition because of hit & miss availability. Don\'t want to find something one week - and then get stuck without the next. Hopefully that will now change.    "

In the shower or bath, I\'d rather be washing my hair or something which feels more nuturing and relaxing. Therefore, this new razor has an appeal for me because it actually  1) feels good as I hold it (I make jewelry, and I like the feel of a well made tool in my hand--this razor, Venus Embrace, is almost ergonomically designed) and 2) feels good as it glides on my legs.The pod holder won\'t work out here, as we have children. Anyone who leaves an exposed razor in the shower, held by a pod wih suction cups, who has kids, is, of course, insane. I suppose I see the appeal of the pod for childless people, who want a razor which has a station where it can be \'docked\' to air-dry conveniently, and there IS a good spot for the extra cartidges to be stored inside.The pod looks like a small space ship or a mini house designed by a famous architect, or possibly it just resembles an egg. I enjoyed looking at it for a while before I locked it and the razor in the closet after using them.I definitely recommend this razor and I will continue to use it. I will continue to buy refills for it as well. It is simple to use, pleasant to hold, as I said, and easy to deal with. Off to shampoo, now!    "

When I first opened it, it took me a good 5 minutes to realize that it wasn\'t one of the solid bar deodorants. I had no idea how to use it and it took me quite a while to figure it out. The turning mechanism on the bottom can be frustrating because when you first use it it is difficult to make it work. Another problem is that it is really messy. While applying it you have to keep turning the bottom wheel for more gel to come out which can get annoying. After you are done it really messy and easy to get on your hands, chest, and even the actual container. However it is a very strong and powerful deodorant. It felt great and I could smell it\'s freshness the entire day. Without applying too much even it worked exceptionally well. This is the first time I\'ve ever used a gel deodorant, and I think I might just stick to it. If it\'s possible you should buy an individual one before you get a multi-pack to try out.

I always got razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and my facial hair isn\'t even curly. I have tried everything from electric razors, to clippers, to double edge safety razors, and even changing the directions that I shaved. Nothing has ever really worked.  I received a free fusion in the mail, and was skeptical. I tried it, but I still got razor bumps. But then I thought for a second about shaving WITH the grain and NOT stretching the skin, and thought even more about using a shaving brush that I had purchased. I also decided to use a simple, cheap shaving cream, Barbasol Aloe Shaving Cream that I already had in my closet. I found the SOLUTION!  But I should also mention that I shave in the shower with a mirror. I now look forward to shaving, and I feel that shaving everyday is best because it allows your face to grow accustomed to shaving, also allowing the hairs on your face to grow in the direction that you shave, remember-WITH the grain. If you shave with the grain you greatly reduce your chances of having ingrown hairs. If you want to love shaving, and be like that guy who has a perfect shave, get yourself a gilette fusion, a shaving brush, a shower mirror, and a mug. Shave in the shower:Let your face get wet with hot water for at least 2 mins, put some shaving cream on a brush and stretch your skin out (only while brushing)  and brush your beard for 2 mins, fill your mug with hot water and dip your razor in the mug every couple of strokes. Shave in the direction of hair growth, never against and don\'t stretch it, if anything puff up your face! I make two passes, after the first one I re-lather and fill my mug up again with more hot water. And you don\'t need to leave the water on!!! That\'s what the mug is for.

Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better, though the blades got clogged easier. After using that for a while, I got a free Fusion in the mail. It was heaven. I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave, but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave. I\'ll take the latter. My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless; the two times I used it, I nicked myself. Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.As an aside, I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro (my wife got them free with coupons and sales.) I found both annoying, but the Fusion to be far more annoying.    "

It worked quite nicely though it did take me 3 times on one arm and 2 on the other to completely clean off both areas.  This may be due to my not having prior experience using this type of \'pre-soaped\' razor.  I wasn\'t at all sure of how much pressure to apply....I do so hate cutting myself!  I did not have any razor burn or irritation after use so I consider this shaver to be really nicely functional.

217,225,20090316,B0001LQGEM,3,"March 16, 2009",A2WP6HUL15WKNC,Average performance,"After using this razor for a short period of time, I feel compelled to tell others how it stacks up in the world of razors. With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one. The cartridges are still available in some stores, however. This review specifically covers the Sensor3 cartridge system.Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor3. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Sensor3 cartridges are noticeably smaller than the Mach 3 cartridges, by comparison. The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.The shave: 3 stars. I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving. I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days\' facial hair growth. The angle of the blade takes some getting used to. I noticed several times that I placed the blade on my face at the wrong angle, presumably because of my adjustment to the Mach 3/Fusion/Quattro razors which seem to have a more linear handle design. The biggest problem I encountered were several cuts. Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors. I do note that the shave was close, but comfort was lacking.Durability: 3 stars. This is the durability rating I give to the Sensor3 disposables. I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges. Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.Overall: The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable). For razor systems, one would be advised to choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.    "

As long as it was, I was willing to spend more.I was not disappointed with this. I knew my son was running a temperature by his temperament and feeling his forehead. The rectal thermometer read 103.1, 102.4, and 101.9 when taken three consecutive times. Right out of the package the Braun ear thermometer read 101.6, 101.6, 101.5, 101.5. I took mine and it read as 98.8, 98.5, 98.5. MUCH better than my old thermometer and it took a fraction of the time. Not to mention it\'s much easier to get than a rectal temp, and I look forward to seeing just how easy that will be when we need to use it in the middle of the night!No, the screen doesn\'t light up for night time use.

There\'s no special technique, it\'s easy to clean, and it\'s disinclined to cut you. It doesn\'t feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I\'m using the same handle, and I\'ve since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can\'t feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don\'t reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won\'t fare as well. I\'ve bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.I\'ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it\'s difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it\'s been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge. Nitpicking, really.A safety razor would probably give you a closer cut, but if shaving is something you dispense with rather than an event to relish, the Mach 3 is where it\'s at.    "

I chalked it up to the first time.... Next use I still wound up bleeding (though not as badly).  After that I began to use regular shave-gel with the blade (defeating their whole point), and with that I still get razor burn and abrasions, but no bleeding.These blades defeat the very trait I use Venus razors for, and the earlier reviewer is correct-- the \'moisture bars\' fall off after a couple of weeks (maybe 5 or 6 uses in my case), making them no bargain (I can use the regular blades for a month or more each).The DO shave closely and leave skin smooth, but are not worth the trade-off in discomfort and blood.My advice is skip these and get any of the other blades in the line-- I\'ve tried them all at different times and they all work better than the ProSkin ones.

One AAA battery (included) goes into the handle.  Just press the blue button and you get a vibrating disposable razor.  Very cool, but it doesn\'t seem to make a difference.  For one, the marketing materials included in the package make no claim to any incremental benefit of using the vibrating razor function, only that it turns itself off after 7 minutes.  There are plenty of claims about the thinness of the blades, etc. but nothing about the power function.  In fact, it\'s distracting, and in some cases for me, interferes with the tactile nature of shaving.  Sometimes you need that feel when you\'re hunting for a few whiskers that escaped the first one or two passes.  You don\'t want to redo an area too many times, so you sense by feel where the patch is that needs extra attention.  This razor made me realize how tactile in nature blade shaving can be.As for the rest of the features, I\'m sure Gillette made some incremental improvements but I can\'t tell.  I do think the first shave out of the package was just marvelous.  If I were rich and spendthrift I would only use each blade once.    "

I\'ve tried alternative blades, including old-fashioned double edge blades, and although I resist buying and using the Mach3 because IMO the cartridges are way overpriced (one source says the cartridges cost 9 cents to produce, yet they typically retail for around $2.30 per cartridge), I always return to the Mach3 because it gives me the cleanest, most consistently bloodless shave.I\'m looking now at the Mach3 I bought back when they were introduced side by side with a Mach3 disposable, and if there is any difference between the actual shaving heads, I cannot detect it. I don\'t know if handles that hold Mach3 cartridges are made the same as they were when I bought mine, but my old one has some metal on it and is heavier than the disposable, which is all plastic and rubber. The handle of the disposable is fatter than that on my old Mach3, making for a somewhat more comfortable grip.I bought this 6-pack of disposables because with Amazon\'s present special offer (a $2 e-coupon that is applied at checkout) the price per unit is only around $1.80 each (compared, as I say above, to an average price of around $2.30 per cartridge). When I use these up I\'ll look for the best price I can find on Mach3 cartridges or disposables and will purchase whichever is cheapest.These disposables have clear covers over the blades, which slide off and can easily be slid back on, making them especially handy for travel.A few years ago, after shaving for around four decades with various shaving foams, I discovered Aveeno shave gel and have used it ever since. A little bit goes a very long way so I don\'t worry about the price, and I find the Aveeno gel/Mach3 blade combination perfect for my face and fairly dense and tough beard.    "

Whenever it starts to get dull, I can keep the razor itself and just change out the blades. Even the blades seem to last a long time, at least for me. I only have to change them once every six months. I like this because it has a moisture strip, but it\'s small. The razors with big moisture strips are absolutely ridiculous; I\'m assuming you\'re supposed to use those for when you have no soap to use because those basically provide the soap for you, which I find annoying.

I\'ve been using Gillette Mach3 Turbo blades for years, and frankly got tired of paying $3.05/per blade at my local grocery store. I shopped Amazon to look for a cheaper price, and came across these Sensor3 disposable blades which are getting fantastic reviews (for some reason). I thought I\'d give them a try, seeing how they\'re almost 1/2 the cost (per blade) as my non-disposable Turbo blades. WHAT A MISTAKE! These blades are comparatively very dull right out of the box compared to the Turbo blades, and I\'m lucky if I can get 3 shaves out of them before needing to throw them away. Worse yet, they do NOT provide a close shave, they nick the hell out of my face, and sometimes that occurs on the very first use of a brand-new blade. Still, I thought I better do a cost comparison, since the Turbo blades are so much more expensive. So, here\'s the net-net:Sensor3 Disposables: $1.57/per razor, $0.52/per shave (based on 3-shave average per blade)Mach3 Turbo Non-Disposable: $3.05/per razor, $0.43/per shave (based on 7-shave average per blade)When you factor in that I\'m getting a much closer and complete shave with the Mach3, virtually zero nicks (I average probably 1x every 6 months at most), and better pricing on my Mach3\'s online, I\'m not going to be buying any more Sensor3 blades...

I\'ve never used Turbo and I\'m not sure what it would add to my shaving successes, so I figured I didn\'t want to pay more for this feature.Amazon had the best price I could find on the regular Mach3, but when I received them I must say they look different than I remember.  They seem to be made of cheap black plastic, I could swear the ones I bought in retail stores felt better made.  I dropped my razor in the shower recently and the metal tabs that hold the whole thing together bent and tweaked the cartridge -- this had never happened in years of dropping store-bought Mach3s.  And it might be my imagination but it seems like I am needing to change blades more frequently, as if the blade is a poorer grade metal that dulls or corrodes faster.I can\'t prove it but I suspect Gillette is trying to phase out this product to steer consumers to a more expensive update, and is manufacturing a cheaper version for guys like me who cling to this product in hopes of avoiding the more expensive update, but the spotty quality will probably push me there eventually anyway.

Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option. So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested. The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power. That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you\'ve ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your  shaver), you\'ll come to appreciate that gillette\'s blades can last a very long time. The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful. I\'d like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can\'t without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution. That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.Gillette probably hates customers like me. I use a cartridge for up to 6 months without replacement. Partly because I don\'t shave everyday (when you have a beard, skip a day and it\'s not really obvious). I\'m still on the first cartridge so I can\'t tell how dull it\'s become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it\'s 4 months now).

I have always been a Gillette Razor user since I started to shave over 25 years ago. I have sensitive skin on my face and neck so shaving is a difficult process for me. My job prohibits beards so I need to shave every 2 days. With razors I have used in the past, with a 2 day growth,  my beard wasn\'t long enough to soften the stubble so it\'s like shaving sand paper. This always resulted in razor burns, nicks and cuts. Sometimes I looked like a victim of a masacre. My last razor was the Mach 3 Turbo. Very good razor but still got some nicks and cuts. Then I saw the commercial for the Fusion razor with 5 blades. My first thought was \'gimmick\' It will be just like any other razor, so I was reluctant to buy it. Eventually after seeing the commercials over and over again they stated with 5 blades there is less friction on your face and it will reduce problems, I broke down and bought one- the power version. The first time I used it I had\'nt shaved for a few days so I had pretty thick growth. The razor was incredible. It hugs your face like no other razor I have ever used. Even on the curves. It feels like it\'s sticking to your skin. When I was finished, not one nick or cut, and no burning sensation. It was the closest shave I ever got. My face felt as smooth as silk. The real test would be 2 days later with a minimal beard growth. That\'s where most of my problems occur. So here I was looking in the mirror with shaving cream on my face and the razor in my hand. I turned it on and went to work. To my surprise and delight it performed with flying colors. No nicks, cuts or burns!! At last a razor that lives up to the hype! I am sold and will use it until Gillette comes out with a 10 blade version! hehehe. Please remember, everybody\'s face, skin, and beard texture is different so you may not get the same results as I did. The blades are very expensive but last a little longer than the Mach 3 blades. However for the shave I got, I\'ll pay it. The one thing that takes a little getting used to is the single blade up on top. Great for shaving  under your nose or marking a sideburn line but takes some practice to use it. I cut the bottom of my nose with it the first time but have gotten the hang of it. All I can say is give this razor a try. If you don\'t like it you can always go back to your old one.    "

If you\'re going to offer a subscription on a product at a set price, then try honoring that price, not an immediate increase of 38% once you have the consumer signed up.

This is the only razor blade with which I can shave without using any shaving cream (that is why I prefer the one with lubricating strip).  Any other razor blades, made by either Gilette or other companies, including the expensive ones like MACH III, will simply cut me. Then Gillette stopped making them, with no reason whatsoever, probably it worked too well, like the light bulb that will last 100 years.  I complained to their customer service with no avail (they are really not a very customer responsive company)  My friend was smart, he bought a whole bunch from K-Mart when they went out of business.  I used to be able to buy them in local flea markets but lately they all but disappeared.  Therefore, I am simply grateful for Amazon.com to be able to make them available.

1998,2070,20100702,B003987CL0,1,"July 2, 2010",AU70G084OYMMM,Nothing special about this razor when compared to the others.,"I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age. The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better but that was always not the case. So I\'ll briefly compare this to the other razors I\'ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel. The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade. Thats all I have to say about that.The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner. Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same. So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave but I still decided to stick with the comfort of the Mach 3. So up till now the Mach 3 was my razor of choice.Now the story changes a bit:I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided. I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking I would never use anything else. BAD DECISION!!!! My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power. At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I\'m getter older so it\'s my skin\'s fault. I would get ingrown hairs and it was then embarrassing to go out. I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved. I tried various skin treatments to rid of the irritations and redness but nothing would work. The problem with the fusion was that the blades would only last about 3 shaves and then irritate the hell out of your face. ONE DAY I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY ANOTHER RAZOR.I then bought the Schick Quattro Titanium and boy was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion. It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever. They would stay sharp for months and wouldn\'t clog if a shave gel was used.(I know people complain that it clogs but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh it doesn\'t).Now Hydro 5 vs. Fusion ProglideHydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5. At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water. The shave was not as close as I would have wanted. The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge. Still I kept on using it since it came with 2 refills anyway. The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.Fusion Proglide: I bought the sneak peek package just to try the razor before it came out and all I can say is AWFULLLLLL!!!!!!! This time I couldn\'t even get one good shave from this crap. Turns shaving into gliding my A$$!!!! It\'s very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot. So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I\'ve ever used so far. The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind the exaggeration but you know what I mean).Final verdict: Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers. They are nothing but marketing now. Up until the Mach 3 they were my razor brand but the fusion and fusion proglide are nothing but scams. They look cool but I think they are face wreckers. Then again I have sensitive skin so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise. Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help. So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin. It will not clog with Zirh or Anthony Logistics shave gel and causes no irritation. The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates. Sorry for long review but I just had to share my experience.    "

One wouldn\'t expect them to last for months, but more than a 2-3 showers seems reasonable at this price point. The blades themselves are good, though, and last considerably longer after the moisture bars have worn down, so it can still be effectively used with shaving lotion -- which, of course, defeats the point of this skip-a-step design. I gave it 4 stars anyway because it *does* -- for the first shave or two -- do as promised, give you a simple nick-free shaving experience without using any additional gel/lotion/cream. Also be aware that they\'re superior to \'normal\' razors primarily just on long, smooth planes of skin, like legs or forearms. In smaller or less flat areas the moisture blades may not actually be able to make contact with your skin because, by necessity, they do not sit exactly flush with the razor blades. (Aside: other reviewers have said they\'ve gotten these cartridges to last longer by mounting the storage hook somewhere other than the shower, i.e. someplace dry. Will try that and report back.)

The idea of 5 blades that are battery operated to vibrate in an orange handle seemed like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Very gimmicky and overkill and bordering on kitsch.  But rather than going through the hassle of returning them I popped in the battery after rolling my eyes at this corporate invented need and gave it a try.  As much as I wanted to hate it, I found it to be a definite notch up the shaving food chain.  The blades are very sharp and the vibration somehow seems to allow the head to glide more smoothly and evenly over the beard.  The shave and closeness were the best I\'ve ever experienced.  Even the single blade on the opposing edge for maneuvering in tight crevices like under the nose worked perfectly.  All this comes with a cost.  When I surfed over to see what the cartridges actually cost I was horrified.  Soon they\'ll need to be locked in a glass container at the grocery store with an armed guard in front of the display.  Second, not sure if it\'s planned obsolescence engineered into the cartridges, but the blades seem to last only a few shaves, making them even more costly.  The blades being mounted so close to each other also make them hard to rinse and they clog easily.  Buying in larger quantities lowers the cost per unit somewhat.  Personally, I\'m hoping beards come back into style to create some downward pricing pressure.    "

Whenever these shaving companies come out with these number-of-blade toppers, the inevitable question asked is \'where will it end?\'  I think the BladeMask comment answers that question in a facetious but, hey who knows, perhaps accurate way.  Touch&eacute;.I\'ve always been a (very) early adopter of Gillette blade innovations, so I bought the Fusion first day of release.  [ Hey, A.G. Lafley bought the whole freakin\' company after testing a Fusion prototype, so that\'s a pretty good testament.]In terms of the Fusion itself, there are pros and cons vs. upgrading from the Mach Turbo 3.The pros:- Does seem to be a better shave (certainly takes less strokes, that\'s for sure).  Gillette has succeeded in raising the bar again.- I suspect you\'ll get less wear on each blade meaning you\'ll be able to keep the blade in the razor longer.  [A key point when you  read my \'cons\'.]- The industrial design of the razor, the blade and how the two pieces fit together is a thing of beauty.  A real indication of the increasing pervasiveness of CAD in every aspect of our lives and the need to compete on functionality, price AND design.  [Thank you, Steve Jobs.]- The blade on the back is a real breakthrough.  Sounds bizarre in concept, but great in practice.  You\'ll keep your sideburns straighter and not bang up that space under your nose trying to cram 3+ blades under there.The cons:- Well, of course you need that backside razor because the darn surface face of the blade contraption is so big (this is the \'Big Bertha\' of razors) and spongy-flexible like a teenage gymnast that you can\'t get the shaving impact area within a country mile of the undersize of your nose.  The backside razor isn\'t just a coolness factor; it was birthed out of necessity.- Gillette has now taken its famed \'give way the razor to get the blade revenue\' business model (and the mother of all business analogies) to a price-gouging extreme.  $25 for eight blades? (and that\'s the discount).  What will happen is that shaver across the world will look for a way to extend the life of each blade.  Gillette famously doesn\'t recommend when to change blades  leaving the decision to each shaver (and, hey - Richard Nixon and I had different shaving needs, so how could they possibly recommend a standard).  But - my reaction will be to double the tenure of each blade I put in play.  I think others will consider the same practice.    "

It does not cut and tug on hairs and the blades are so smoooth, despite the old fusion blades being terrible. I love this shave and recommend anyone with sensitive skin to buy this product.

I use the manual version.Note: I use these with Art of Shaving brand Unscented Shaving Cream applied with a Badger-hair brush, their Pre-Shave Oil and their Post-Shave Balm. I was always skeptical of high-priced shaving lotions and potions. But, I\'ve got to tell you these AOS products really work! After following their instructions, I\'ve never got such a close or comfortable shave. Get a sample and try it for yourself. I bet you your Edge gel or whatever shave cream you use now goes right in the garbage can. Don\'t get freaked out when you see the price. Actually, the AOS stuff really isn\'t that much more expensive (on a per shave basis) that the products you are using now. You use very little of it for each shave. Your face will thank you.    "

I prefer the multi-blade razors as they always seem to do a better job and the best I have used so far it this Gillette Fusion.  The five blade head shaves my face smooth on the first pass and I do not have to often reshave an area over.  Multiple shaving over the same place tends to give me razor burn.The flexible head follows the contours of my face and always keeps the blades at the proper angle for a clean close shave.  The single blade side is good for trimming my side burns and my mustache.  I also like the Lubrastrip and when it is gone it is about time to change blades.  It is a good indicator of the razors usage.The grip elastomer coating on the handle makes it nice to shave with as you can get a firm grip on the razor even with wet and soapy hands.  Overall it is a good design and it works well for me! I get a close comfortable shave.

I purchased a M3 Power razor about a year ago and had little complaint with it, the biggest complaint I had was that the button on the handle was in a bad position, mainly the space that I like to grip the handle.Unfortunately, it seems, the new generation of Gillette suffers from even more problems than the previous generation. The button is still in that same godforsaken place. On top of that, the downstroke, or rather, the stroke with the grain is almost completely worthless. I will admit, it didn\'t grab the stubble or tear at my face, and it was a smooth stroke, exactly like the previous generation, but it left a horrendous amount of stubble. The cause of this I believe to be the huge blue buffer pad on the bottom edge of the blade. Even the new blade on the back end of the razor is practically useless. It cuts even worse than the ones on the front.The only positive thing I can say about this is the redesign of the handle. Unlike the M3 Power, you can use your index finger up higher on the handle if you so choose to but your continuously pressing against it and bumping the button.My conclusion would have to be that this is a subpar razor for a radically outragous price. $14 for the Razor, $14 for 4 replacements, and $30+ after tax for 8 replacements. It seems like Gillette was more concerned about getting as much money out of your pockets as they could than they were about designing a better razor. I will be returning to using the M3 Power, if only to save myself time whilst shaving.    "

I\'ve experimented with this razor for the past few days.  I will not be permanently upgrading to this.  For some reason, Gillette appears to have completely bought into the notion that five blades gives a better shave than just two or three.  Like the Fusion Power, the Fusion Proglide Power has some of the same problems.  The most obvious problem it has is cost (just like the Fusion Power).  For the quality of the shave you get, the cost of replacement cartridges is not justified.  To be fair, I have noticed a slightly more comfortable glide with this over the Fusion Power.  The blade stabilizer and microcombs do appear to be a modest improvement in this regard.  Also, the Fusion Proglide blades appear to last a little longer than the Fusion Power blades - but not by much.  The micropulses still do not provide a greater degree of comfort over a razor that lacks this feature.  Also, I have not noticed a closer shave with this razor over the current one I am using (which is now the Schick Hydro 3).  When comparing it my current razor, the Fusion Proglide Power definitely lacks the level of smoothness and comfort.  Last but not least, just like its predecessor, I\'ve discovered this five bladed razor tends to nick my face more often than a double or triple bladed razor.  Gillette needs to get back to basics by realizing it is much easier to keep a satisfied customer who gets a good, comfortable shave as opposed to introducing new brands of razors that have gimmicks, and that are, not to mention, ridiculously overpriced.

I have never once had a cut with this razor.Evidently the battery vibration system in concert with the three bladed razors works well. I also get the smoothest shave I\'ve ever been used to. Tip: Run the blade with the whiskers, then make another pass lightly \'against the grain\'. You\'ll wind up with completely smooth skin, no razor burn, and no cuts.The blades are pricey, but in my experience last longer than the blades I\'d used for decades before. When you beging to feel any pulling at all, they are ready to change. Under normal circumstances you won\'t feel this shave against your whiskers at all. You can use the blades for a while after you start to feel a pull ... it still does the job and will just feel like your old razor did.This razor and these blades give me the most comfortable shave above the lip that I\'ve ever experienced. I have a pretty bristly bit of whiskers there, and have experienced lifelong pain shaving that area. I do get a pull feel there even with this razor with new blades, but no pain, and a relatively easy pass to shave there. I do not use the \'against the grain\' tip there tho, LOL, just a second pass with the grain but with a bit of extra pressure to get it close.I\'ve used this razor for a few years now and am delighted.

The cartridges are expensive, so I\'ve alternated between the Fusion and a Merkur safety razor with Feather blades.  When I want a really close shave and don\'t have a lot of time to spend shaving, I opt for the Fusion.  It requires less preparation time for my beard and I don\'t have to be nearly as careful while shaving.  Also, typically one pass does the job with the Fusion.As for the new model, the Proglide, there are improvements.  They\'ve created better spacing between the blades to help keep the razor from clogging.  I think this also improves drying, which should lengthen the life of the blades.  I don\'t care how much, or what kind of coating they put on the blades, they will eventually rust.  It seems also that the trim blade is improved.  It\'s very handy for getting the tight spots, like right under your nose.  That\'s a problem area with a safety razor and certainly with a Mach 3.  All in all, this is a great razor and one that I would use every day if the replacement blades weren\'t so expensive.  I\'ll keep this puppy in the rotation, especially for travel and those times when I don\'t have much time on my hands.Recommended, but only 4 stars because of the price.    "

There are two things that I have always loved about it.  First, it gives an incredibly close shave.  Other razors cut reasonably close, the using the Fusion there are times when I can run my hand across my face and not detect even the tiniest bit of beard.  Nothing but smoothness.  The other thing that I love about the razor is that I have cut myself using it less than any brand of razor than I have ever used.  One might think that five blades might actually increase the chances of getting cut, but this isn\'t the case.There have been several minor design changes over the past few years.  They have all, however, been rather minor.  Until now, that is.  The new Proglide version of the Fusion is considerably different than the other versions.  The main improvement is that blade now tilts back much more sharply, allowing you to shave at many more angles.  I find that this allows a much better shave than before, especially around the nose.  It is just easier to use than before.  The other major change is that there is a heavier lubricant strip.  Frankly, I\'m not a big believer in lubricant strips.  They don\'t seem to me to aid much in shaving.  But if you think this matters, it is definitely true that the lubricant strip is heavier than on the old blades.So, if you haven\'t used the Fusion series, I definitely recommend doing so.  It is a great razor.  And if you have been using the Fusion, I would definitely recommend the upgrade to the new Fusion Proglide.  It is a great improvement to an already great razor.    "

942,969,20080402,B000XVSNTQ,4,"April 2, 2008",A3H7ADUP07D93H,Works great but no better than Venus Divine,"When I was growing up razors were a simple affair.  A single blade and that was that.  I remember the first ads when double blades started showing up.  The idea, according to the advertisers, was simple: the first blade would pull the hair so that the second blade could cut it closer to the skin, something that to me defied all logic.  I didn\'t have to worry about it for a long, however, as after a while I switched to depilatories.About a year ago I decided to switch back to shaving and went to buy a razor.  To my dismay, pretty much every model had four blades. What in blazes did anyone need all those blades for?  The heads of these razors were huge.  And why stop at 4?  Why not 6, or 8?  All I wanted was a simple double-bladed razor.  No luck.  I ended up getting the Gillette Venus with three blades and I\'ve been quite happy with it.  Seems someone at Gillette, however, thought that more would be better, or at least more profitable, so when I saw this new red five-headed beast offered through Amazon Vine, I thought I\'d give it a try and see if it was all just marketing hype.  I mean, what the hec? You can always use another razor around the house, right?.  To tell the truth though, I wasn\'t really expecting to like it.  I figured it would be bulky and awkward and just not worth the extra cost of the replacement cartridges.Turns out that this is quite a nice razor in spite of the extra size of the cartridge, which is definitely larger than the three-bladed ones.  First of all, I should point out that all Venus razors accept all Venus cartridges.  I was able to swap cartridges just fine between the new Embrace and my old Venus Divine.  It doesn\'t matter whether you bought a plain Venus, a Venus Divine or a Venus Embrace razor.  You can use any of the replacement cartridges with any of the razors.  The biggest difference between the cartridges is not the number of blades, but the amount of lubrication, as I discovered when I accidentally ordered plain Venus replacement cartridges instead of Venus Divine cartridges.To test out this new razor, I compared it to my old Venus razor with a new plain Venus cartridge, using the new razor on one side of my body and the old one on the other.  Much to my surprise, there was a huge difference in effectiveness as well as comfort between the two, with the Embrace cartridge coming up with much more hair.  Also, the lubrication seemed to smooth over the rough edges of any dull blades.  When you have this many blades, some of them are bound to be dull, but at a cost of about three bucks a pop, you don\'t want to have to throw one out.Okay, this is way too long a review for a stupid razor.  In short, both the Divine and the Embrace are great, better than plain Venus cartridges.  If you already have another Venus razor, though, there\'s no need to buy a new one.  Just get a pack of replacement cartridges.Oh, and by the way -- the blade holder thingy fell off my tile in less than 10 seconds and only holds two replacement cartridges anyway.  Gillette should scrap these things, which are just going to end up in landfills.    "

351,360,20080313,B000277P5E,2,"March 13, 2008",A2QMXIFIVE4LNS,"Cheaply made, mediocre, and overpriced.","Mediocre and Overpriced, March 13, 2008By  supernatural (Illinois) - See all my reviewsUnfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems. It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I\'ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don\'t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \'fins\' or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \'prep\' your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \'classic shaving\' to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.    "

Recently, I have been forced by them to move to Schick.  Not happy with being a virtual monopoly when it comes to men\'s shavers Gilette decides to over-engineer and to greedily get more profits by going so overboard that they have successfully made me give up on them after decades of being a loyal consumer.  As other reviewers have alluded to I actually got cut a couple of times which has never happened before!  I\'ve come to realise that the battery operated vibrator is a gimmick that does nothing at all to get a closer shave except to cause more batteries to be consumed and to fill up our landfills.  Thankfully, I\'ve been using rechargables for years and hence haven\'t had to buy batteries for years.  For people like me with sharper facial features, this 5-bladed \'wonder\' has such a large amount of rubber that it makes the overall blade area too high/thick (the breadth or height i.e. the vertical edge of the blade) to cover my chin area below my cheeks close enough without cutting my face.  Quite clearly the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns doesn\'t dawn on them when clearly there is a limit to the number of blades before you actually start spoiling the product!  For me it seems any \'improvement\' from going to 5 from 4 blades is so negligible to be non-existent in addition to giving me multiple cuts as the blades now do not contact my face as closely as before when I go from my cheek to my neck area.Unlike Schick where all their blades fit on all their holders greedy Gillette makes us \'upgrade\' to various blades by having to buy ever new blade holders.  Not content with profits from the blades alone, they have to insist on us buying the new holders to increase their revenues.Sick with the blatant exploitation of consumers, I have tried for the first time I can remember the Schick Quattro and I am happy now to get a close shave without cuts for a lower price knowing that any future blade enhancements will still fit my blade holder.Thanks Gillette for pushing me to your competitors; I didn\'t know what I was missing until now.Definitely NOT recommended!

Whereas most other body wash products such as Right Guard and Nivea, at least has some level of adhesion to my skin long enough to wash and distribute across my skin to work up a lather, there is next to no lather; perhaps the emulsification is too high.

1759,1818,20100601,B003983HRI,3,"June 1, 2010",AORCXT2CLTQFR,The Gillette Fusion line\'s latest incarnation.,"When the original (manual) Fusion shaving system was introduced in 2005, it was truly a major improvement over any and all previously available razors. It was (and still is) a truly revolutionary, advanced and innovative shaving system that made shaving virtually painless and hastle-free even for men with tough beards and/or sensitive skin. The ProGlide is the latest incarnation of the Fusion and it does offer some advantages over the original Fusion but not nearly enough to justify switching over (especially when considering that the replacement cartridges will be even more expensive than the manual Fusion\'s!). When I shaved my head with the ProGlide, I honestly noticed NO difference whatsoever (neither better nor worse) than when I shave with the manual Fusion. When shaving my face, I did notice that the ProGlide DID do a slightly better job than the manual Fusion at shaving tricky and hard-to-reach areas (especially the moustache area just below the nostrils and around my Adam\'s apple) but this is probably because the ProGlide\'s cartridges are supposedly 15% thinner than the Fusion\'s. I should also point out that the ProGlide\'s handle feels more sturdy and offers a (somewhat) tighter grip than the (manual or Power) Fusion\'s and that the design is more elegant but (of course) beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The Bottom Line: Fusion ProGlide offers some minor improvements over the manual Fusion but nowherenear enough to justify upgrading to an even more expensive product when an already excellent one is available.

It makes for a much more comfortable feel. I personally would have liked the handle to be a little bit wider, like maybe half an inch, but I\'m still pretty pleased with the shape and feel. While the Divine didn\'t slip in my hand very often, the Embrace doesn\'t slip in my hand at all, so there\'s less of a chance of a painful nick.The Embrace has a slightly larger razor head because of the \'ribbon of moisture\' strips around the blades. The larger razor head is a little annoying because I have to be more careful about maneuvering the razor over my \'bumps.\'However, I am extremely pleased by those \'ribbon of moisture\' strips. They make for an incredibly comfortable shave, much more so than the Divine. I could tell the difference in feel right away and it was amazing. Just that factor alone made this razor worth the price.The Embrace has five blades while the Divine has only three blades, and I can\'t really say I notice a difference in shaving efficiency or closeness because of the extra two blades. I *might* be able to feel a slight advantage to the extra blades, but I\'m also not entirely sure if that\'s all in my head or if it\'s real.The ShowerPod that comes with the Embrace allows you to snap your razor into place and store extra blades inside the plastic pod. It attaches to your shower wall via suction cups, which in my opinion is a huge improvement over the old Venus ShowerPods that required you to attach them with double-sided foam tape. The ShowerPod is a nice place to store the razor in the shower, but I honestly think the whole concept of storing extra blades in the shower is unnecessary. I never change my blades in the shower--I do it before or after--so in my opinion, the storage space in the ShowerPod is a waste of plastic.All in all, this is a great razor if only for the fact it\'s so much more comfortable than the Divine. Don\'t get me wrong, the Divine wasn\'t uncomfortable at all, but the Embrace has improved the model significantly.    "

And I came to always the same results, cut, burn, soring, irritation, razor burn, you name it I had it, and you can guess, many scars, which made the opperation of shaving worse every morning. The gel to keep it short I went from clinique to gillette and always the same result.  I was using one blade that made shaving more tolerable gillette\'s sensor excell when my wife arrived from one of her shopping errands and presented me with what came to be my salvation for the next four years, the mach3, which I put together with the Neutrogena sensitive skin gel and clinique\'s aftershave balm and the rest is history. Then I reluctantly accepted my wife\'s new present the Mach3 Power, and voila! My perfect match I haven\'t been this happy in years, comfy with minor irritation and no cuts for months! Until last week! When I felt so confident and adventurous about gillette\'s new product, I spotted it cueing in the supermarket and thougt \'It\'s gillette! More blades, better shave, what can go wrong?\' Well, when I arrived home my wife told me, that machine looks mean, and I replied, yes and I hope its mean with my beard and gentle with my skin, we shared a laugh. Next morning I went to the bathroom and started sahving, one pass, second pass, not bad... third pass... slash, hughe, and I mean big, cut just on the border of my mandible! I was pulling down when this happened! I was being extra careful due to the sharpness of new blades. It peeled off about 3/8\' by almost 2\' of my skin, I have only seen this kind of surgical precision on dermatomes! It took me eons to stop the bleeding. You can imagine my dismay, I got my refund and be done with it for good!Why can\'t Gillette just have a mach3 power with the nice features of battey indicator and the chip set as well as a more powerfull motor? That would work perfectly for anybody, hell... I would buy it, eventhough their product slashed my chin open!P.S. My wife told me \'I told you it looked mean\' I did not laugh.    "

By then I had already made my mind up to give proglide a try based on a thinner blade. As you will see here the overwhelming majority of people including me find this the best shave ever. What I find is I feel like its not shaving it is so easy to use and the results are a smooth shave no bumps or irration. Yes, very expensive and when I tried to go back to hydro I longed for proglide so here I am very satisfied albeit the price is high but my hopes are the price will drop a bit. I wish hydro would come up with a thinner blade because it really does matter. Everyones shaving experience is different but I am able to use the blade a minimum of 5 times before the blade degrades. I did find it challenging to shave moustache area but with time it has gotten better. I do shave my head as well with great ease too. Proglide really changed the shaving game. Highly recommend!    "

I have the Venus \'Vibrance\' and am quite happy with it, but decided to try the \'Embrace\' out of curiosity because I cut myself so often with just about any razor I use.  At the same time, it seemed like something with five blades would definitely cut closer and get most of the hair without having to go over multiple times and irritate my skin.  The question is, does it really hug to your curves and get all of your hair in one shave and leave skin smooth?  Yes, it does do a pretty decen job of doing these things, but I didn\'t feel it is a whole lot better than my three blad vibrance blades, except that it shaves just a little bit closer, which is nice.  So, overall, if you have sensitive skin, this might be a good razor for you.  If you like to just shave over an area once and expect to get all of the hair, this is about as close as you will get to that.  God Bless ~Amy    "

2024,2096,20100610,B003987CL0,5,"June 10, 2010",A2H2I5FY1PUHP1,Five Stars From a Life Long Shick User,"To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.I\'ll begin by saying that I\'ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.ProGlide vs. Hydro 5Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.What\'s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette\'s as a travel holder with no problem.Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro\'s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as \'suspension\' for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.On initial \'hefting\' the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.The Shave TestAll of the above are secondary to the \'Yes, But How Does It Shave\' test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream and a badger bristle brush.Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \'razor burn\' marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \'dried\' she still said the Gillette side was smoother.Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.ProGlide vs QuattroShave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.So what\'s not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn\'t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.    "

This size package offers the lowest cost per blade.  However, whenever Gilette brings out newer (and ever higher-priced)products, suddenly, the sharpness of the older blades seems to go downhill.  This is obviously designed to drive consumers toward the newer shaving systems.  Being an older guy, I\'ve seen this happen time and again.  Suddenly, the blades you have been using for years are duller and don\'t hold their edge as well.  You move up to the newer shaving system to get back to the old comfort level, at a higher price.  Then, the cycle eventually repeats itself.  I am sticking with the M3Power blades as long as they are available, because the newer system is still more expensive and doesn\'t give me any better a shave.

Well...for the first time in the history of mankind...there\'s truth in advertising. OK, that\'s a bit of exaggeration on my part, but to be perfectly honest, it actually is the best razor that I have ever used...hands down. I usually only shave once a week (to my family\'s dismay), so my stubble is quite long. I use to have to trim down my semi-beard with an electric razor and then shave, but now I use the ProGlide and it literally \'glides\' through my stubble for a nice clean shave. I also like how the stubble doesn\'t get caught in between the blades. I use to have to bang the razor against the side of the sink to get the captured stubble hairs to come out of the razor, but those days are now long gone.If anyone is reviewing replacement blades (as I am doing here), there should be no question as to the satisfaction of the product (proved by the continuing purchase of the product).

He\'s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.His current razor is a Mach 3, so he did side by side comparisons between that one and this Fusion Proglide. He did the typical half-the-face test where he shaved each half with one of the razors. He did comparison tests where he tried it powered and non-powered.For all of these tests, the result - the shave closeness - was about the same. This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.As for the *process* of shaving. running the Fusion Proglide with the power off felt similar to using the Mach 3. However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \'pull\' - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  I\'ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.He was expecting the trimmer blade to be pretty useless - but it turns out it was pretty convenient for trimming. You can\'t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.He used it for a half dozen shaves, and the blade still has a little life left, which is on par with a Mach 3.For people who already have a Mach 3 and didn\'t care about the \'shaving process itself\', there\'s no real reason to change blades. People who are having issues with tugging and pulling might appreciate the smoother shaving experience with the Proglide.On the issue of blade cost, if you buy the Proglide blades in bulk, you can get blades closer to $3 a blade. Still, this can seem expensive compared with other options.In the end we\'re hoping when we run out of Mach 3 blades that the blades for this one might have dropped in price and we\'ll move over to the Proglide. However, but it\'s not like we\'d toss out the Mach 3 and the existing blades in order to use this.    "

I can tell you that the blades, though expensive, last a long time for me.  I have moderately tough facial hair.  The old disposable razors gave me a few days of shaving and they were history.  I have shaved up to two months with these razors and still got a good shave.I have read that there are controversies about the value of three blades.  I think the three blades help keep the razor at the optimum angle on my face for shaving.  I do get a pretty good shave as well.  I do use Edge Advanced Shave Gel in combination with my Gillette Mach3, which may help get me a better shave.Most men in the United States shave, whether we like it or not.

The razor clogs, and I always wind up breaking out (even as an adult).I like using a better made blade from Gillete. But I\'m never going to run out and buy the latest and greatest with a bunch of blades in a row, vibrating components, etc. I just want a decent disposable blade that doesn\'t cost a fortune. I truly won\'t cave in and buy expensive blades often, I\'ll be the guy who skip days of shaving to make expensive blades last. Give me a cost effective alternative, and I\'ll shave everyday.    "
508,518,20100714,B000BUUVTE,5,"July 14, 2010",A3R2CKUWKONROT,"Phenomenal Shave, Plain and Simple","My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette\'s Fusion blades:  Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use.  After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize.  This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain.  Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken.  While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm.  Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus.  Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again.  Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return.  My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years.  I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year.  The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece.  However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave.  Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit.  Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.    "

You put it on and it stays on, it\'s completely invisible. With other deodorants you will begin to smell your body odor permeate through the inferior deodorant after a few hours. With Gillette Clear Gel, there is no body odor, ever. If I wanted to, I could go days without showering and it would keep working strong the whole time.

236,245,20050609,B0001LQGEM,5,"June 9, 2005",A2ERK85P6X5I6S,FINALLY! Something that works on my face!,"I have the worst possible combination for shaving: a thick beard and sensitive skin. Ingrown hairs and razor bumps were a weekly, if not daily occurance for me. I started off as a teenager with the original Sensor. When that got too painful I transitioned to the Sensor Excel. That served me well through my college years, where I could get away with shaving every 2 or 3 days. I found that my face needed a day or 2 off before I could shave comfortably again. When I entered the workforce, the president of my company noticed the stubble on my face during my \'off\' days and insisted that I shave every day. Well, after about a week of daily use with the Excel, my neck was about as raw and sore as it ever had been. That was about the time that Gillette introduced the Mach3. I transitioned to that, and eventually the Mach3 Turbo, but I was STILL getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps.I did some research and found that my technique (shaving against \'the grain\' without shaving with the grain first) was causing a great deal of my problems, so I started to change my ways with less than stellar results. The Mach3 was designed to be used \'against the grain\', and shaving in the direction of my hair growth produced almost no results at all. I couldn\'t even feel the razor cutting anything as I pulled it down along my face and neck. In addition, the added width of the blades made it nearly impossible to shave the areas underneath my nostrils. I had to keep my old Sensor handy to tackle that area when I was done with the rest of my face. My fiancee suggested spending $20 on the new battery-powered Mach3...no, thank you!Then I saw the Senor3, and decided to give it a try. The blades were cheaper than the Mach3 (even at Costco Warehouse prices), so it wasn\'t much of an investment for the experiment. All I have to say is, \'THANK GOODNESS!\' The Sensor3 has the best of both worlds between the Excel and the Mach3. The blades fit any Sensor handle, which is a more traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn\'t have to invest in a whole new system. It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it\'s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors AND I can get to the area under my nose. But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results. To the outside world I look clean-shaven every day, even though I can feel a tiny bit of stubble. That\'s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.I now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I\'m as smooth as a baby\'s backside. I\'ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort. The \'Art of Shaving\' products are a godsend. Invest in the Pre-Shave oil, trust me. I also went \'retro\' and picked up their shaving cream and brush. Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it\'s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route. I think I FINALLY found something that works for me after 15 years of shaving!    "

Then I bought a Gillette manual fusion and stopped laughing.  It was awesome with closer shaving and the blades lasted one month for me!So I just purchased the Proglide Power Razor.  My \'qualified 5 star rating\' is given because the improvement of this razor over my first 5 blade manual Gillette is no where near the improvement seen in moving from the 3 blade to 5 blade system.  There is no night and day difference.  I would not be surprised if the razor by Gillette testing is an improvement.  But the difference I believe is too small to discern for an average user.  It may come down to whether you like the vibration.  I will say that I have not determined if the vibration helps prevent the buildup of hair between the blades which is feasible.  Nevertheless, I love this razor.  It is entirely optional whether you use the power capability or not.  And relative to my older manual 5 blade the handle on this Proglide is much more rounded and comfortable.  It is not heavy at all and in fact is likely very light yet solid if you remove the battery. So I would recommend giving it a try and figure out for yourself how you prefer to use it.  My one caveat at for this early review is that I have not been able to determine how long the blades last but do not expect that to be significantly different, and if I am not mistaken the older blades still fit as well.

It took one try to conclude it was totally useless for my purposes.  I have a full beard that is cropped fairly close to the chin line.  I found the Fusion Pro Glide razor head too thick and bulky to perform any type of precision shaving at the edge lines.  Coupled with the trimmer as a handle, it was extremely awkward to use.  I attempted to use the battery operated trimmer along the lip line underneath my moustache and got nothing.  The trimmer is not sharp enough and does not get close enough to cut anything.  Trying to trim the rest of my beard with the snap on combs was an exercise in futility.  The trimmer head is too small and the 3 combs do not provide enough flexibility in terms of hair length.  All in all, I found this product to be a total waste of money.  The best part was the Duracell battery which I removed before throwing the rest in the trash.  Do yourself a favor and don\'t get taken in by s slick marketing campaign designed to sell overpriced razor heads.  If Gillette had spent as much money on the product as they did on the packaging it might be a different story.  There are a number of small rechargeable beard/moustache trimmers in the same price range that out perform this product and a variety of disposable razors that offer more precise shaving.  I\'d rather have a couple of products that perform well instead of one that does not.    "

Although I thought the five blades were a gimmick and put off trying it, I really do like it better than the previous Excel razors.  The \'precision\' blade on the top rear side is much more convenient than I would have expected, allowing me to get a good line on my side burns.  The blades last over a month for me, and I shave every other day on average (full beard growth, just sensitive skin).  When the Proglide Power razor went on sale for less than a new Fusion cartridge would cost me, I decided to give it a try.  Yeah, that was a no brainer.  :)  I liked the shave, and I decided to stick with it for another eight cartridges when this package went on sale.In my opinion, these aren\'t a big advance over the Fusion Power.  In fact, it doesn\'t seem much if any different to me.  The Fusion Power worked very well, and so does this.  These give a clean shave with minimal effort, even when I recently went five or six days without shaving over vacation.I was disappointed when the bottom glide strip on my first Proglide cartridge came loose.  I have never had a problem with a Fusion Power cartridge.  The two Proglide cartridges since then have held up nicely, though, so I think/hope it was an anomaly.So, I recommend giving these a try if you\'re unhappy with your current razor.  I do think that the Fusion Power are just as good, and they can probably be found for less money because they are the previous model, so you might want to try those first.    "

I\'ve been using this razor for several months, after waiting to hear from others just how well it works.  I have a fairly tough turf, shaving only MWF, resting on the weekends.  Up until this point, I liked Sensor Excel best, and detest every electric unit I\'ve tried. Since I really like the razor, I was surprised by some of the low rankings. I use Edge gel with extra lubricants, and I shave in the shower (yes, these things make a huge difference).Pro:-Blade life appears improved over my Sensor Excel-Vibrating handle not a gimmick, works well once you get used to it. Initially I found a lack of my normal \'feel\' when shaving, but quickly adapted-A beefy well-weighted handle with a secure seal for the battery.  Other razors have popped apart with the blade flying off on me if I dropped them, but not this one.  My Sensor Excel was notorious for this.-Large blade \'eject button\' is nice, yet doesn\'t let the blade pop off prematurely (see above)-The \'hole\' in the handle head is great! I have a wire rack that holds my shampoo and soap.  This same rack has a few \'hangers\' that this razor slides onto nicely-Very good battery life (still on the first one months later)-Plastic holder has a bigger \'foot\' to stay upright better and it\'s easier to see at a glance how many blades that I have left due to the clear sides, a feature that my Sensor lacks-On/off button flashes when battery gets low... hard to miss and allows you to get a least one shave-Best for last: a very close shave on a very tough faceCon:-Razor head is large, single blade on the back is a good idea and is sharp, but I can\'t seem to make it work as good as it sounds. It\'s a first generation idea that I am hoping gets some refinement.-Price... Ouch! Fewer blades per pack AND much more expensive. Buy in bulk, look for sales, save coupons-Plastic tray is much larger than my Sensor yet holds fewer spare blades (4).-Old blades from Sensor are not compatible with Fusion (you can mitigate this problem by taking your old shaver to work for those embarrassing days when you miss a small spot)Bottom line: Recommended if you\'ve got a rough face!

I absolutely think that they are the best razors. You buy a handle that comes with razor cartridges and a holder for the shower and then just buy additional razor cartridges as needed. One cartridge will last me for months, much different and eventually much cheaper than the cheapest disposable razors which only last about a week or so.Gillette\'s new Venus Spa Breeze Razor combines the great Venus razor blades and handle with new shave gel bars that eliminate the need for separate shaving cream.I wasn\'t sure at first about how well the shave gel bars would work but after trying, I\'m hooked. This changes shaving for me from now on. It\'s aggravating to have to use shaving cream and with the Venus Spa Breeze, you don\'t need it.Perfect for shaving in the shower, just wet the razor and glide the razor over your legs. A smooth shave with no irritation. Afterwards, my legs were incredibly smooth and soft. Just be careful over smaller areas like underarms to be sure you have plenty of water to avoid irritation. It seemed the longer that I used the razor like over the long stretches of leg, the shave gel bars seem to really work the best. The razor doesn\'t produce foam or cream like actual shaving cream but just a slick moisturizer, that\'s why it works best with plenty of water.*Note* If you are currently a regular Venus razor user, the cartridges for the Venus Spa Breeze fit the blue Venus handle also so you could just purchase the Spa Breeze cartridges to use with your current handle.Highly recommend. Venus Spa Breeze razors are all I\'m buying from now on.    "

I received the Gillette Fusion as a free promo and decided to try it. The initial sensation of having 5 blades scrape across my face was a bit unsettling (I imagined a layer of skin being shaved off) but the results were startling. Very close and comfortable shave -- only the beard was removed, not the skin. Single blade on the reverse side works fine for trimming sideburns and under the nose. I used the first blade for 22 shaves and did not nick myself once. I could only get 6-7 shaves out of a Sensor blade so, for me, the high price for Fusion blades is justified.    "

Impressed by some great reviews here, I decided to give this a try.Using my old Sensor or Mach3/Mach3 turbo I had irritation, averaged 2-3 nicks or cuts per shave, and the razors weren\'t up to cleanly shaving a few difficult areas of my face (under the ear for example).Using this thing, this wondrous Fusion Power Razor, left me with as many, or more, irritated areas, averaged 5+ nicks or cuts per use, and it couldn\'t cleanly shave even the areas the other two razors have no problem with.  Plus, it actually gets stuck shaving against the grain.I\'m serious, it stops moving and you have to put more pressure on it, bear down harder, to get it to move which, of course, results in those extra cuts and irritation, and then it still misses patches of beard you just tried to shave.This is just a waste of money.  The technology behind this is only different, not better.  No doubt it\'s the 5 blade foolishness that makes it stop moving in rougher sections of the beard, and the power blade vibration seems to accomplish nothing at all.I\'m convinced that the rave reviews here are from people new to shaving, people who have light beards, or people getting paid to promote the product.

I go between the two as far as replacement blades and whichever is on sale. They are pretty similar, and either of the blades actually fit on either the razors.I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago. I have since tried a few new models thinking that perhaps one of these new razors might work better... but I keep coming back to this razor.The Mach 3 is so far, the only replaceable blade razor that I have found I can easily, properly shave my head without nicks and cuts. The blades tend to wear fairly quickly compared with the Shick Hydro 5, but what is the use of longer lasting blades that slice my head to ribbons?The grip is a great improvement on the Sensor XL, more heft, better wet grip. The blades are easy to attach and remove. They last me a couple of weeks on average, but I shave my head every two to three days and shave my neck below my beard every day. That\'s a lot of use.I did start using a new shave gel and it works magically with the razor. No more issues with serious gumming up of the blades. Check out King of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.. It\'s expensive for a shave gel, but nothing works better for shaving my head and preventing the shave gel/cream from gumming the blades.I know the replacement blades are expensive, and many third party sellers are reselling stolen merchandise... but that\'s part of why they are expensive. Those of us who are buying the blades on the up and up are paying for all those stolen and re-sold packages. So I just recommend buying from a store or trusted seller rather than eBay. Also watch for replacement blades not sold in retail packaging. Often these are either knock offs or have \'fallen off a truck\'. Spend the extra $5 and make sure you are getting the quality blades from a reliable source.    "

But if what happens to me happens to you, then it is worth every dime.I have razor bumps on my neck.  I had seen a dermatologist many years ago to ask him why my neck always seems to break out in red bumps.  He pulled a couple of my whiskers to show me the exact reason.  When my whisker grows, it immediately starts to curl inward after it breaks the skin. It then grows back into the skin which causes the red irritation mark. He said this is actually quite common and sometimes called razor bumps, but it is really ingrown whiskers.If I go more than 48 hours without shaving - 2 things happen.  I start to see red bumps all over my neck and worse - more than 1 of them will bleed.After my latest bout with this issue I decided to give this baby a try. Wow, closest shave I have ever had and more importantly - no bleeding.  Since it cuts the whisker so clean, I can also go more than 2 days without shaving.Please note that in my testing, I actually ordered this Power version, and the non-power version.

The lubrication strips are better than others I\'ve tried--you really don\'t need shaving cream or soap, and they last quite a while.The Venus has the added advantage of a holder that suction-cups to the shower wall, so you don\'t lose the razor.  So far it has stayed put.  Inside the holder is a spare blade, so if you decide it\'s time to change blades, you don\'t have to venture dripping from the shower to find a refill.Yeah, the blades are expensive.

But, even though I have no financial reasons constraining my purchase of this example of our \'finest\' technology, I think there could be some misplaced priorities in a society that would spend almost $4 for a razor blade for their razor that vibrates while shaving via a little battery propelled motor.  Do we really need this product to satify our need to look so nice, or could we feed a few more people with the same amount?  Or do we buy it simply because it is the best?  Or, perhaps we need to by this product to assure Gillette makes a fat margin after they pay their marketing people who make up an eight word name for this product (if we count the hyphenated word as two)?  I think men should stop shaving until Gillette finds a way to sell these things for less than $2.  The world would not end if we let our beards grow and reduce their sales to next to nothing.  The worst that would probably happen is they would be forced to sell their company at a huge discount from its current value to a buyer who would pay so little for the company that the blades could be sold for an amount significantly less than $2.  Could we even survuve in a world that no longer produces $4 razor blades?  I bought these blades because they are the best available, but I really do not need the best available.  They really do not do anything of value for me.  I just think it is incredible that we have been sold on the idea that we need a smooth shave.  Now we have guys who shave their heads so they will not reveal their natural loss of hair.  And some guys are shaving their bodies because they think their hair is in the wrong place or their girlfriend or boyfriend do not like hair in the \'wrong\' place.  I think our thoughts are in the wrong place.  I believe we all have the right to appear the way we wish.  But I also have the right to chuckle at my self and others who think $4 razor blades are great stuff.  I rated this product with five stars because it works well, but I reduced it to three stars because it is so unnecessary.  While this is an unnecessary product, it has no real objectionable purpose other than its reflection of how we squander our assets at time when we criticize our government for its outrageous spending choices that are driving our country to financial failure.  In conclusion, do we have the moral authority to demand a like reduction in our wasteful government spending while we continue to buy $4 razor blades.  The answer must only be \'Yes\'.  Our government should not have any control of private spending, but the electorate must have total control of government spending via the House of Representatives even with items of insignificant amounts.  Even though this example is related to razor blades which seem insignificant, our government\'s thinking in this regard is they should be spending as little as possible to accomplish a specific purpose and then only when they have determined that the purpose is one that is worthwhile and necessary.

I was beginning to think that the competition to create a razor with the largest number of blades was getting ridiculous. I starting shaving my legs with the original single blade razors which did often cause embarrassing scrapes and cuts. The twin blade was a much heralded advance that resulted in a better shave and less abrasions. I even bought into the triple blade and was impressed, but  I drew the line at the quattro. This was getting ridiculous. Soon we would not have to move the instrument more than a millimeter to shave an entire calf. Come on!?The free vine product enticed me to try the Embrace five blade razor and its a winner. The shave was safe and incredibly smooth. I like the idea of the replaceable cartridge in the comfortable and light weight plastic handle. The case that suctions to the shower wall is a cute extra but not a reason to purchase this razor. Its performance, however, is definitely  worthy of the purchase price.    "

And after owning it for a month or two now, it\'s definately a good trimmer to be battery powered, but not great as it is advertised.  First I\'ll list the pros...ProsGreat for shaving-With the fusion proglide heads, this razor is awesome.  It has the same quality, but better since it has the higher quality handle.  I threw away my old proglide handle in favor of this sleeker and more efficent design.  As far as the face shaving aspect of this product, it\'s excellent.Great for trimming your facial hair-Another aspect where the Styler is excellent.  I\'ve used it to trim my goatee and sideburns quite a few times, and it gives an even and effective trim.  Plus, it\'s the original reason I bought the Styler, since my Phillips Norelco beard trimmer cut and trimmed my facial hair unevenly.  With this though, trimming is very fast and simple.  I also like how the trimmer comes with three length combs, making it easy when I decide to grow a beard and blend my goatee with interchangable trimmer combs.  When trimming my goatee, I used the 3 guide comb, which is perfect for trimming the length on shaggy hair without completely oblitterating my goatee.  Then, when I wanna grow my beard out, I used the 1 guide comb to blend my goatee in with my stubble.The razor comes complete with a stand to hold everything-I couldn\'t believe for $20, I got a razor/trimmer/attachment combs/tray.  The tray that comes inside the packaging means your bathroom will be more organized than using traditional razors or trimmers.  It\'s also smart the way the tray has 3 openings in the back for each guide comb and one opening in the top for the fusion head attachment to rest in.  And the fusion attachment head is built efficently, since it has an attachment that fits neatly on top of the trimmer head.  It also looks cooler and makes storage easy and effective.Now onto the cons...ConsNot great for lining facial hair-While this trimmer is perfect for trimming facial hair and shaving, it\'s not great at lining a beard, sideburns or goatee.  This actually surprized me, since the Gillette campaign in the advertisements claims it\'s great for lining and detailing.  Specifically showing in the commercials how supposedly great it is in detailing and lining facial hair.  In that department, it\'s a bit of a disappointment, but I\'ve never found any cartridge razor that can line as well as a disposable razor, and this is no exception.  And as far as the edger is concerned, the few times I\'ve tried lining with it, it never did a phenominal job, more like mediocre at best, since in most instances I wound up using a disposable razor to correct it.Doesn\'t have a long battery life-Not really too surprizing here, since I\'m kind of OCD when it comes to keeping my facial hair looking neat.  Plus, I have used it more often than just on my face, thus a partial reason why the battery isn\'t lasting very long.  I\'d say the average battery life of the Styler would be a month if not used for body hair or any other non facial detailing purpose.  Since it\'s so efficent though, this isn\'t a major issue for me.  Others might see it that way however, since batteries are kind of costly to replace.Not great for use on body hair or lining the back of your neck-I really don\'t consider these two areas major issues, since the Styler is only intended for face use anyway.  I feel though that I must point out for those who think this might be great for trimming body hair or good for lining your neck in between barber visits, this isn\'t the tool for either purpose.  With this being a battery controlled trimmer, it\'d take you forever to use on body hair.  Plus, to me using something on your body hair that\'s intended for your face is kind of cross contaminating anyway.  I initially thought I might be able to use this for lining my neck hair in between trims, but this won\'t leave an even cut or line.  Something my old beard trimmer could do, but again not a big deal to me, since this product is for facial shaving and maintenance.Overall, I rate this 4 out of 5 stars since it\'s great at shaving and trimming facial hair.  Really, for about $20 bucks, this Styler is a quality invcstment for any guy.  It can do most things a beard trimmer can at half the cost(not counting the cheapo pieces of crap trimmers).  I wish this thing was rechargable, then it would be darn near perfect.  If you\'re expecting to be using this for any other purpose than facial hair, you might want to invest in a good body hair trimmer or hair clipper set instead.  Otherwise though, I have been happy with this purchase and would buy another set once it needed replacing.    "

So I\'ve tried practically every razor on the market in search of something which doesn\'t cause irritation. Simply put, this razor has proven to be the best I\'ve ever used. Unlike most razors, it does exactly what it claims to do: glides across the face and neck without even a hint of friction or irritation. Thus, it\'s now my razor of choice.That said, the ProGlide isn\'t cheap. In fact, at roughly three dollars a cartridge the cost of ownership is fairly outrageous. So I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend it for everyone -- the second-best razor I\'ve found is the King Of Shaves Azor, which is FAR less expensive (it can be bought online from the brand\'s site).

It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements.  It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils).  A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable.  The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands.  All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming.  What else can you ask for?  I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful.  It\'s now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it\'s thoroughness and reliability.  The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers   so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes.

The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves.  That was an excellent product.  However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to \'migrate\' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model.  I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be.  I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none.  I\'m lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn\'t cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What\'s the deal?  Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product?  That they\'d rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one?  If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off.  I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it.  So much for my customer loyalty.  I\'ll either switch brands or stop shaving until there\'s another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3.    "

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

Overall, I thought the razor was really good. I have very sensitive skin, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn\'t have a razor burn from the 5 blades.  However, having been forewarned about that possibility, I used a lighter hand than I do with a 2 or 3 blade model.  I love the feature of letting it hang in your shower. Very nice with small children so I don\'t have to worry about it falling off the shelf into their reach.  I also could tell a noticeable difference with the moisture strips. My skin felt very smooth after just one use.  I like that the pivoting head made it easy to shave underarms and around the knees without knicks or remaining hairs.My only complaint, as one other person mentioned, was that the excessive amount of plastic on either side of the blades makes for a lot of extra work.  You think that you\'ve already shaved a certain part of the leg, only to realize that you must have only gone past it with the plastic.

These blades would not stay on either of my Venus razors - the friction from drawing it up my leg was enough to pop it off several times over the course of one shave.  They also did not fit correctly into the plastic they come in; I had to pull the blade out with my fingers instead of pulling it out by the handle like you\'re supposed to be able to do.  Finally, they were so dull that they didn\'t take hardly any hair off of my legs.  I\'ve been using Venus razors for several years now, and I know how sharp they\'re supposed to be out of the box.In conclusion, be careful what you buy.

They very cleverly use terms like \'a better way to shave\' or \'30% closer blades\', and there is a reason for this. The reality is that very little (if any) improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems. And Gillette knows this through their own internal research. Their studies show that customers can\'t discern the difference between 3-blade and Fusion systems. It is all just perception. However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems. The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.Here is another interesting tidbit you probably didn\'t know about all of this. Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements. Well there is a reason for this too. The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer. Gillette doesn\'t want folks to get a bad first impression. As you probably know, they don\'t make money on the razors. The real money is with the replacement blades. And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.With the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.

I have purchased the refills faithfully and only used something different (Quattro) when I was traveling because I have a travel case for the other razor.I shave my face and head.  I use Gillette shave gel just as I have for years.On to the Proglide:I have never understood the point of a power razor that was not an electric razor.  Now that I have used a power razor, I still don\'t get it.  I have a hard time telling where the razor is on my head with the vibration activated.The blade has not lasted nearly as long as the original fusion blades.  I do not know what has changed, but after just two weeks of shaving, I look like a cat has gotten ahold of my head with his claws extended.  The original blades would last at least a month, but not so with this new blade.  I also do not get nearly the quality shave that I get with the original blades.I would save my money on this razor and go for the original fusion or even the quattro.  I got it for free in their promotion and my head wishes I had missed the link on Twitter.    "

They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion Power blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.Pros:- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade- 5 blades makes the process smoothCons:- Price- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It\'s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.    "

I\'m a 5-6 day a week shaver, so pretty regular. And I will also say I H-A-T-E shaving. Man\'s face was never meant to have a sharp object ran across it to take hair off. That\'s what I believe.For all the talk of these razors having a smooth shave, I\'m not that impressed. It feels different than the Mach 3s I\'ve been using since the late 90s, when they came out. Probably because it\'s a wider surface moving across my face. The features of my facial hair are: Relatively fine, not thick, but tough. And along my neck the hair grows in at least 3 different directions making shaving that much more frustrating. I will also add there is a spot along the left side of my larger than average chin that consistently gets missed. I must run the blade over it at least 3 times, and by that third time, my face has had enough and is quite irritated. I don\'t believe I had that problem with the Mach 3s.I posted a comparison shot of this razor (they are placed upside down relative to the camera, too). The one on the left is after 3 uses. The right has not been used. Notice the glide strip appearing on the bottom-it\'s half gone! I don\'t know if the metal will last the weeks I\'ve been reading about, but that strip isn\'t going to! I don\'t anticipate having a anything near a smooth shave if I let those blades touch my face a few more times, not based on my years of experience.AND...I must also note that I have well water that is VERY hard. You can see the calcium build-up on the sides. I believe that probably shortens the life of any razor.I don\'t doubt the guys who say they have gotten good use from this blade. I haven\'t, and likely won\'t, so I will eat the 10 bucks I spent and go back to my Mach 3s.    "

Maybe that\'s where the advances end since I could not tell a difference in shaving between this razor and the Schick Quattro and M3Power razor.  I don\'t feel like it gets a closer shave.  In fact, I don\'t notice any advantages in this razor at all.If you have never used a \'Power\' razor before, try it.  The vibrating that is put off by the batteries is very slight but definitely makes for a closer shave. Battery life is long, and one advantage this razor has is a low battery life indicator. That\'s about it though. The trimmer that was hyped so much is pretty much useless.  I am not a very hairy guy, but I tried it on my sideburns and it didn\'t do anything. Maybe I wasn\'t using it correctly but I couldn\'t tell what it was supposed to do.  As for under the nose, it was worthless there too.The major disadvantage of this razor are the blades.  You\'re going to pay an average of $3 per blade! Considering a blade lasts two weeks at most (which is how often you should replace them, regardless of whether they still work), prepare yourself for a $60 a year razor budget.  The M3Power blades are only $2 a blade, and backwards compatible with previous razors.If money is no object and you don\'t already have an M3Power, this isn\'t a bad razor, but it\'s not nearly worth the hype and price when compared to its predecessor.

By far the Gillette Proglide is the best safety razor I have ever used and I have been shaving for over 50 years.But, to get the best shave with this razor or in fact, any razor you should follow these simple techniques:1.  Get a shower mirror, not that expensive, and shave in the shower at the end of your routine, make sure water is running and at a pretty good temperature.  The longer you stay in the shower before shaving the softer your beard will be and easier to shave.2.  Get yourself a bottle of Baby Oil, doesn\'t have to be Johnson&Johnson\'s any brand will do, even Walmart\'s brand.  I tried the Baby Oil gel, but it\'s too messy and gooey.  Just plain old Baby Oil.  Step away from the shower and put a good amount of oil on your face and neck. Rub it in as best as you can to make sure your beard is pretty saturated with the oil, you don\'t have to over do it, but just make sure you have enough oil on your face that you know it\'s there.3.  Shaving cream.  So far the best I have found is Aveeno\'s Therapeutic Shaving Gel. Available everywhere just about. Apply the the shaving gel OVER the oil that you put on your face.4.  That\'s it! Shave now like you would normally with your Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor.  You will not believe the closeness of your shave, plus your face is being nourished somewhat when using the Baby Oil.  The oil makes the razor glide smoothly over your face and actually lubricates the shaving blades, MAKING THEM LAST A LOT LONGER THAN IF YOU DID NOT USE THE OIL.Summary:  I change the Gillette Fusion Proglide blades once a month, honest.  Once a month! And I shave about 5 to 6 times a week.  Getting 20 to 25 shaves is nothing using this technique.  I probably could go longer than once a month, but can\'t be too cheap, lol.Hope someone tries this.  The combination of the Baby Oil and using Aveeno\'s shaving cream makes this all work in my opinion.  It\'s not that expensive to try if you already are using the Gillete Fusion Proglide razor.    "

Once I got over the shock of the gigantic sized cartridge, I was okay.What comes in the package:  One handle, one cartridge and a suction holder (which didn\'t stay suctioned anywhere in my bathroom).The handle: Is smooshy and has a soft gel-like grip.  I loved this.  It doesn\'t slip around in the shower and fits nicely in my hand.The cartridge: Did I mention this was huge?  I was trying to find a common object to compare it to.  I ended up using money. The cartridge is almost as wide as two quarters.  There is still portions on left uncovered above the quarters. The razor itself has 5 blades-nice.  On either side of the blade is an Olay bar-which is what makes this so huge.  I\'m assuming these will shrink with use.The shave: I was not brave enough to use this without soap on my legs.  I usually just squeeze shower cream into a bath puff and lather my legs. So, I don\'t use a thick lather...just enough to help the razor glide and not give me razor burn.  I did notice that there was an improved smoothness to the shave.  Even with my usual shower cream, there was not a big lather. For me, this is a plus. For others, the lack of shaving cream/gel thickness may take some getting used to.The shave was close. My skin was smooth afterwards.  It even did well under my arms.  Now, if you were to use this anywhere between your underarms and your legs, there may be issues since the cartridge is gigantic. This is a bummer.The cartridge refills run about five dollars each.  A bit pricy but if you are no longer buying shaving cream, the cost evens out.  The plus is that you can use the refills on any Venus handle (per the product description of the replacement cartridges).  However, this handle is better than the Venus handles I\'ve used in the past, but if you have a handle...it\'s nice to know you\'re not being forced to buy a new one. Brownie points for Gillette.The front of the package has a sticker guarantee that states \'Love it or 2x money back\'.  My final thought for this review is: If I would have paid for this product, would I take advantage of the guarantee?  My answer is no.  Although the size of the cartridge is what is keeping me from giving this 5 stars, the bars on the cartridge are superior to the nasty little sticky moisturizing strips on other razors.  The shave was good.  If purchased on sale, it would be an excellent buy.I will update my review to note how long the bars last on the one cartridge that I have (shaving every other day...down from my previous daily OCD shave).

I\'ve never cut my armpits while shaving before with my Mach 3, but with this, I\'ve cut my armpits, my bikini area bleeds, my legs don\'t get as close a shave as I\'d like... this razor is a bulky mess and I DON\'T recommend it.

Frankly, I was often not even looking for quality - I was just looking for a quick, (relatively) fast way to remove unwanted stubble.Low and behold - I happened to read some reviews of Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, complete with 1 Razor and 2 Women\'s Razor Refill Cartridges. The women who used them seemed pleased, so, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring. Sure enough, the simply packaged product arrived at my home, just yesterday. In need of a touch up job, I decided to try my hand at this blade. I must say, I was very pleased. It didn\'t feel like I was even shaving! That was how smooth the razor glided down my legs, and under my arms. The moisture strip definitely did the trick. No ashy, flakey skin or the pain I come to associate with razor burn. The shave was close, too. I don\'t see stubble, after nearly twelve hours - which is unheard of, for me. I am from Lebanese/Latino/Indo European stock.

Some people have said they get like 100-200 shaves per blade.  I guess the key is that these blades don\'t lose their efficacy after a few shaves because they go dull, but because they accumulate gunk.

Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn\'t waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3\'s were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I\'ve had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an \'upgrade\' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so.  I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you\'re handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, \'What were they thinking?!\' crosses my mind.  I\'ve discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.

The only thing they seem to have changed is the razor holder, and I do NOT like it.The old razors came with a large holder that sticks to the shower wall and opens up to hold two spare razor heads. This new holder is MUCH smaller and suctions to the wall. You just slide the neck of the razor into the holder, and that\'s it. I\'m not sure why they changed this. I would think wall space in the shower isn\'t really something most people are trying save, and now, your spare razor heads have to be kept outside of the shower. To some this may not be a big deal, but I ALWAYS change to a new razor head while I\'m in the shower.Overall, I still love the razor and the job it does, but the new holder design is, IMO, no good.

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "

Finally, you do not need torrential water pressure to clean your razor.  Actually, cleaning the Fushion reveals its best feature.  Under the flow of tap water, with the motor on, it sounds much like a mini didgeridoo, the Austrailian aboriginal instrument.

This blade cleans my face perfectly and I find it extremely rare to suffer a nick or cut on my face.  The handle is perfectly designed and bends to the contour of my face.  The blades pop in and out easily.  One drawback is that the blades are just a bit pricy.  But, the blades also last as long as three of the disposable blades I used to use.  The moisturizing strip could last a little longer, but it isn\'t a major factor for me.I gave this product a 5 because it is the best razor I have found.

While I was impressed with the Mach 3, and more so with the Mach 3 Turbo, when I switched to the Quattro, I knew that was the razor for me. Close shave, smooth glide, rarely any cuts at all even on my difficult-to-shave face. Recently when I went to the store, they were out of the 4-pack of Quattro blades, and so instead of buying an 8-pack, I decided to try this brand new razor from Gillette. I\'d never had a 5-blade razor before (let alone a battery-powered vibrating one) and so I decided to go all out, even though I was very disappointed to find that the cartridges cost $3.50 EACH.It comes in a nice easy-to-open clamshell package with a cheesy-looking but convenient holder that can either lay flat or stand vertically, which is what I prefer. It comes with a battery, which was very easy to install, and is touted as being shower-proof. I wouldn\'t know, because I don\'t shave in the shower.The vibration was not at all what I was expecting. I don\'t really know what I was expecting since this was my first powered razor, but when they say \'gentle micro-pulses\' I think of a soft intermittent buzz. Not so. This razor is strong, and it vibrates like a cell phone, constantly, insistently and very noticably. I was surprised by how strong the vibration was for a small appliance.I used my standard Gillette foam shave cream, and set to work trimming my face. The first thing I noticed is that I couldn\'t really feel the razor on my face as it vibrated and shaved my whiskers. The second thing I noticed is that I also couldn\'t feel when my face was clean-shaven while the razor was vibrating. I rely on the way the razor feels and sounds on my skin to know when I\'m done shaving a spot, and the vibration drowned out any noise or sensation or any other feedback I might have gotten from the razor. However, it didn\'t make that much of a difference, because I had to go over the same spots four or five times in order to make them clean-shaven. I\'m not sure what the 5th blade is doing, but I don\'t have to shave the same spots that many times with even an old blade on my Quattro. However, when I was done, the final result was a pretty good shave, with a few nicks here and there--the Fusion doesn\'t work well with bumps on the face when vibrating.I also used the single trimmer blade on my sideburns. It seems to work as advertised, and it is easy to use for accurate trimming of the sideburns. The problem, however, is that the single-blade end is no good for shaving a larger area such as your entire moustache, but the five-blade side is way too large for such a task. I found it very awkward to shave my moustache area with either end.Bottom line: I will be returning the Fusion and exchanging it for a set of replacement cartridges for my Quattro. It still outperforms the Fusion in spite of having one less blade in the area of comfort and shaving sensation, and the cartridges are $1.50 cheaper each. I may go back to the Fusion sometime, but if I did, it would be the manual version, never the vibrating version. This was my first and last experience with a battery-powered razor.    "

Gillette\'s is good at all that. I don\'t have sensitive skin, but I\'ve always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.Everything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream.

I switched to a safety razor for facial shaving more years ago than I care to remember and I have yet to find a disposable or replaceable or for that matter rechargeable (and I have tried quite a few) that comes anywhere close to equaling the resultant closeness of cut or smoothness particularly when those infuriating independent gray hairs that crop up under the chin are considered. However, I am not as adept in avoiding a sling blade result on the back of my head with a safety razor so I am constantly in the market to identify a disposable or replaceable that fills the bill.To that end, the ProGlide is acceptable but I still had to make several passes on the back of my head to get a smooth, minimally stubby result, not unlike the outcomes with a Mach 3 or Schick 3... or one of the five rechargeables currently residing in one bathroom or another. Interesting enough, I also got better results on my head with the back side trimmer single blade than the front side five blade shredder.  I didn\'t feel any discomfort like pulling or tugging or experience any inadvertent nicks. Actually, I was mildly surprised that it had cut as close as it did since it felt like it was not cutting at all which I suppose is somewhat of an endorsement.However, with the ongoing cost of replacement cartridges, for my needs there are far too many less expensive, equally beneficial alternatives.

It seems every 2-3 years, a new shaving product comes out that is much better.  I think Fusion is that product.

I use mine extensively everyday and the razor stays good and sharp for weeks; my current one has been used for over a month and I don\'t get cut or stubby whatsoever (however, with everyday use, 2-3 weeks swould probably give best results.) All in all, I really cannot live without them. They are incomparable to other razors, even other five blades.

The orginal Venus had hard plastic that went from top to bottom.  The Divine has hard plastic that goes a couple inches down from the top and then it stops and has a rubber piece that comes up from the bottom.  Then has a few more inches of the hard plastic.  Both of the razors that I had broke right in the middle where the hard plastic was missing.  It is very disappointing, but I will not be buying this razor again.    "

1054,1083,20080415,B000XVSNTQ,3,"April 15, 2008",A2HXE29CU1I24Y,A few good improvements...until next year\'s replacement.,"Gillette has once again upped the ante by switching from a 3-blade shaving system and jumped to 5 blades since the competitor has brought to market their \'quattro\' version.I\'m surprised that after producing a powered razor in the form of Gillette Venus Vibrance, they have opted to go back to basics in a non-powered model that we now see as the Gillette Venus Embrace.  And despite being non-battery operated the price of both products has remained the same.PROS:1. The rubber grip on this new model is top of the line.  There is a \'gel\' quality feel to it that creates a soft cushion to the fingers, but still maintaining a nice solid grip.2. The shaving head is a size XL!  This means even more moisture content to help protect and smoothen the skin while shaving.3. The in-shower storage has been redesigned from the all=time rectangular shape of previoius Gillette razors and formed into a pod shape which Gillette now calls a \'ShowerPod\'.  The modern design is visually appealing and should enhance the bathrooms.Another good thing is that there are two suction cups behind the pods to create an easy install process.  This is a great move away from the old stick tape which can be placed once only with no chance for relocation should you decide you stuck it to a bad portion.  With the ShowerPods, you don\'t need to overthink your location which gives freedom to shift or hide the razor as you please.4. FIVE (5) Blades.  This is a matter of debate.  I welcome more blades to help reduce having to go over the same area and refrain from skin irritation.  More blades also means the hair has more chances of being cut even deeper has the blades pass over the area.  But I am quite disappointed as well with the quality of the blades (which brings me to the cons...)CONS:1. FIVE (5) THIN blades.  Compare the quality of the blades from the old Gilette Venus razors to this new 5-blade system and you will see what they have become.  It seems Gillette has every intention to help consumers keep on replacing the blades more often than before.  The blades are so thin that they loose sharpness faster than ever making you wonder and evaluate how much you should really be spending on this aspect of personal grooming.Of course I welcome more blades in a shaving system to create a smoother shave.  To achieve such characteristic is to have the blades spaced very closely together.  By choosing to do this, you risk loosing other customers that have a thicker hair folicle since a smaller gap means the hair doesn\'t pass thru between the blades and ends up getting stuck.  In the process, the shaving system fails to work as intended and resulting to nicks and cuts.The solution is to frequently run the blades and shake it in a container of water (or running water if you don\'t have the heart to save water at this day and age) in order to loosen and remove any shaved hair that may have piled up in the shaving head.2. EXPENSIVE.  Sure buying a new shaving system is relatively cheap.  But if you still haven\'t learned from the PRINTER/INK CARTRIDGE market, you should watch out for the price of replacement heads especially for newly introduced technology like this.3. MARKET LIFE.  As with Gillette products and marketing, they always have something up their sleeve.  So I wouldn\'t be surprised if they have a powered version ready for market release or a simple change of color depending on the theme of the times.  So you invest in a pack of replacement heads from your local wholesale warehouse and  before you know it, you are marketted another revolutionary shaving idea.4. COLOR/DESIGN.  The color is really wonderful and in time for Spring, but displaying it with your white ShowerPod may not fit all bathrooms.  Yes, it\'s a shaver but it still is built to be displayed within easy reach at the shower for convenience.  But give us a more neutral color like WHITE!  In fact make an ALL WHITE SHAVER and call it the GILLETTE VENUS ANGEL.  Together with the ShowerPod, that should be a better option for most bathroooms.CONCLUSION:Yes, the Venus Embrace is great.  You have created a five blade system and beat the competition once again.  The gel handle is the highlight of this release together with a very big shave head to help create an even smoother experience.However...What I would really like consumers to experience is a better shaving system with a head that lasts longer.  With all the manufacturing techniques, why not create blades that are not only sharper, but also maintains the sharpness.  This should be more convenient than having to stack up tons of replacement blades in the bathroom.  Make use of stronger and lighter materials like Schick\'s use of TITANIUM.  How about go seal the deal in technology and create a PORCELAIN-coated BLADE.  Anything as long as you can give us an idea that you also care for us to save.  In turn, we will create the illusion that we will also be loyal to the brand until the day we die.I still have a problem with the close spacing of the blades creating clogged hair in between them.  The idea of more blades will create cutting shaving time may not hold true since you will have to do more steps in loosening the hair particles in water.Overall, this is another winner in shaving experience.  But it\'s what we would expect from a manufacturer who wants to introduce better technology and ensure a steady replacement of expensive shave heads.    "

After trying their Custom Plus3 and being extremely disappointed, I decided to give Sensor3 a try. They are exponentially better than Custom Plus3, but they still don\'t come close to the original Custom Plus as far as the quality of the lubrication strip and overall comfort are concerned. The razor tends to drag on your skin, leading to razor burn. Why Gillette can\'t use the same quality lubrication strip on Sensor3 as they do on the Custom Plus twin is beyond me. I would also prefer a non-pivot head to give me better control over the shaving angle, but that\'s more of a personal preference. It does not do all that great of a job on the chin and directly under the nose. The angle of the blades does not allow for good surface contact in these areas and can lead to nicks. Also, for my beard, each razor is single-use regardless of the brand, so I need to get the most bang for my buck. These come in a bit on the high-priced side, so that reflects negatively as well. I\'d give it 5 stars for the quality of the shave, subtract one star for the price factor (Amazon\'s price here is *ridiculous*! You can easily get these for 30-40% less in any store, but that is still expensive on a per-razor basis) and subtract one more star for the not-so-great lubrication strip (better than Custom Plus3, but still not as good as it could be). Overall, I will continue to use these, in conjunction with the original Gillette Custom Plus.    "
907,934,20111205,B000XVSNTQ,5,"December 5, 2011",A3EADWE0F3A1J6,Amazing!,"First I have to commend Venus on there packaging. We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you\'re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you\'ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.Finally, getting to the part that\'s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they\'re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs.

When I\'m at home, I like to shave with something that feels like it\'s built to last. After all, you don\'t drive a Power Wheels toy to work. HOWEVER, sometimes the need arises for a disposable razor...and when that time comes, consider reaching for a Gillette Good News razor.Aesthetics: 3 stars. There certainly isn\'t anything to look at on this razor. Lately, many of the big names (Fusion, Quattro) have been marketed in special colors and designs. This is plain razor with a plastic blue handle. The end. Yet, in its understated styling, it still has good features for a cheap disposable: pivoting head (non-pivot style available), lubrastrip, good blade angle.The shave: 4 stars. Yep, this thing ranks right up there with the big boys. It is a close and very comfortable shave. If you\'ve got sensitive skin (like me), the Good News performs quite nicely. It\'s a close shave without ripping a layer of skin off. Cuts are highly unlikely (unless the blade is dull, of course). The lubrastrip provides a small level of glide, but a good shaving cream/gel is recommended with this razor.Durability: 3 stars. I\'ve had disposables that lasted just one shave, others that last a week or more. This one is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack with regard to durability. I typically get three shaves out of a Good News razor.Conclusion: Good shave, ideal for people with sensitive skin. They don\'t last long, but the upside is that they are among the lowest-priced disposables on the market. Recommended.    "

That, coupled with the ribbed rubber strip, creates major shaving frustration. In any case, Gillette makes the best blades, at least for thick barbed wire beards like mine.

It\'ll still nick you, but not often.

For me it has changed the way I feel about shaving tenfold. The fusion was good but I still had issues with razor burn. The proglide changed all that. Usually I go about a day in between shaving. After buying the Proglide on Saturday and shaving that evening, I didn\'t shave till Tuesday night & that\'s cause I wanted to. I could have went a couple more days but I like a smooth head so I shaved. I couldn\'t believe how close a shave I got with this blade and went for days without any razor burn or irritation at all and that\'s going with the grain. I always liked going against the grain cause it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was, my head couldn\'t take the pain afterwards so I stuck with going with the grain. With the Proglide I\'m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road I\'ll give it a shot because just going with the grain I get a damn close shave. I know it won\'t be the case for some other people but for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years. Highly, HIGHLY recommend buying this prduct.    "

Cuts my skin, not a close shave, requires too much pressure to bring blades in contact with skin.","I recently discovered Gillette\'s Venus line of razors (I know, they\'ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite). Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \'what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel so I don\'t have to lather up my skin?\'. Apparently, something other than these Venus Spa refills with the shave gel built in.I don\'t know; maybe I just got a bad batch of razor cartridges, but the one that I opened up doesn\'t really release any shave gel until I\'ve moved well beyond a leg or forearm or two. When it DOES release that gel, it\'s more as a concentrated, thin \'string\' of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair. Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger\'s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor\'s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \'lips\' to get the \'teeth\' to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it\'s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades. Just not well executed.I\'d read all of the reviews for the single packs of Venus Spa cartridges, so I knew that there\'d be a 50/50 shot that I\'d actually like these, but putting them into use for myself solidified it for me. You shouldn\'t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that\'s what I feel like I need to get these to work right. As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I\'ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges. At this rate, I\'d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much. THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference. THESE razor cartridges? Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o\'clock shadow every day, and I didn\'t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble! If you like one of Gillette\'s other types of Venus cartridges, stick with those. As has been proven to me before, the grass ISN\'T always greener on the other side! And the stubble may actually be longer!    "

It comes with a handle and two razor cartridges. The razor handle will hold all Venus razor cartridges, not just the Spa Breeze ones. The entire package was very easy to open and the razor handle and cartridges come in a nice waterproof container that can be stored in the shower, although it\'s not all that sturdy. The package comes with a bracket so you can hang the razor in the shower, however, I couldn\'t figure out how to use it. While the razor cartridge packages are conveniently waterproof, I had a hard time opening them and ended up having to use scissors, which damaged the shaving gel bar a bit.The Venus Spa Breeze Razor was just okay. I love the fact that there is a scratch and sniff panel on the front of the package so you can smell the shaving gel to see if you like the odor and the white tea scent was very pleasant. You need to be careful how you store the razor in the shower especially if you can\'t figure out how to hang it - put the razor face down and the shave gel bars are activated and the razor becomes messy to use. The handle fits pleasantly into the hand and the cartridges snap on and off quite easily. The shaving gel bars are a unique feature and work quite well, but don\'t expect lather like from regular shaving cream. The razor provides a nice smooth shave although I did knick myself a bit, causing my leg to bleed.Venus Spa Breeze Razor is an interesting concept that is perfect for people that may be traveling and don\'t want to pack shaving cream. However, I\'m not sure how long the shave gel bars last, which makes me a bit wary. In the end, I prefer regular razors and shaving cream.    "

Since that generally means I use different deodorants, I\'ve also found that I am fairly sensitive too--some deodorants (that don\'t brag about being strong) will irritate my under-arms.  That\'s not a good combo--to be blessed with genes that make me perspire more than average, yet be sensitive to many deodorants.So, enter this Gillette Clinical Strength.  I had both very high hopes (that it would solve my odor issues), yet was a bit worried that, especially since I had never used anything Clinical Strength before, that it would surely irritate me in some way.To my surprise, everything seemed great.  It\'s basically odorless, goes on smoothly and doesn\'t leave any residue.  Thankfully, no irritation whatsoever, to my surprise.  On a day to day basis, it covers me all day long with no odor (which is way above and beyond many deodorants I\'ve tried).The ONLY reason it didn\'t get all five stars is because I can occasionally tell that it didn\'t fully cover me; but only when I\'ve been doing a decent amount of physical work or been in the heat.  Perhaps I\'m asking too much, but for me, the perfect five star deodorant would be able to get me through a 24-hour period even if I did a decent amount of physical activity.Even though I\'m a very frugal person, and although I was \'manly\' enough to occasionally break through this deodorant, I will certainly pay a premium for this deodorant in the future, as it works better than all the other many brands I\'ve used.

When I first started shaving, I used a disposable manual razor. Twice. After that, realizing shaving wasn\'t something one could usually get out of by choice, I bought an electric razor, of the rotary type. When the Gillette Mach 3 was introduced, I got that to keep for a backup, or for a closer shave for important events, concerts, shows, etc. Eventually I upgraded my rotary razor to a Braun Pulsonic (expensive) razor. Soon after, I tried the Gillette Fusion Power, to see how it compared. Lets just say it compared just enough to be actually worth comparing. This again went into the cabinet as a special occasional razor. About three months ago, as the cartridge in my Braun Pulsonic was aging beyond it\'s recommended life cycle and the shave was getting less close, and more painful, I decided to try the Gillette Proglides cartridges. I used them on my Gillette Fusion Power handle, since it\'s basically the same as the Proglide handle.Here was my experience with not one but four separate cartridges:I decided to shave at roughly the same time every day, just to get a real good idea of how it performed in relation to my electric. I also shaved the day prior, with my electric.The very first shave was very smooth and close, with no tug and pull, just as advertised. I was surprised, but pleased. It did tend to nick up my face pretty bad, but the blades were sharp enough so it didn\'t affect comfort. I shave well in advance of leaving home, so this wouldn\'t have been a big deal. The second and subsequent shaves were dramatically different from the first one. All were painful, rough, uneven, and frankly not all that close. I was close to just heading back to the Pulsonic with two year (plus) old cartridge, but I decided to stick it out. As the strip of lubricant wore down significantly, the comfort of the shave improved. It wasn\'t as close, but it was almost, if not as comfortable as the first. This lasted until the strip was nearly gone, and it was clearly time to replace.I decided at that point to return to my Pulsonic, and just buy the new cartridge, as it had served me well for two years on one cartridge.A few weeks later, I had an interview, so I bought a three cartridge set of the Proglide cartridges. I decided that after I used the one for the interview, I would use the other two to do a slightly different test.With the final two cartridges, I decided to wait varying periods of time between shaves, so the stubble would be a different length each time.Overall, the results were the same as the first time, with a few differences. Any shave of stubble that was between two days and five days old was much more comfortable and close than it would have been at the same point in the cartridge life cycle with shorter stubble. The longest stubble, which was about six days growth, resulted in a shave that was less close, but as comfortable as the other longer-stubble shaves.I don\'t know whether my rate of stubble growth is typical or atypical, but I can grow a nice goatee in about a week.Overall, I think that Gillette is going in the right direction, but they need to strike a finer balance between shave quality, and longevity of blades in order to make these worthwhile.After all the hype (which I tried to ignore, but who can, really?) I was expecting something different, and much improved. Frankly, even the few times when I turn to a manual razor, I would probably turn to the old Fusion, just because I didn\'t have as many guessing games. It worked until it stopped, which was just before the color from the strip was gone. Even for someone who shaves primarily with a manual razor, unless they have money to blow, I wouldn\'t recommend the Proglide.Overall, my opinion is that this is a debatable improvement over the previous generation, and that it was so far over-hyped that it created false expectations. Had it not been hyped so much as a dramatic improvement, I might have given it four stars, but that type of advertising really irks me.NOTE: This was my experience with the product, and since this sort of product depends a lot on individual faces, hair, shaving habits, etc., it\'s not good to draw a conclusion based solely on a few other reviews. In addition, different people expect different things from a razor. I prefer a balance of longevity, comfort and closeness, while others prefer one over the others. My opinion is: if you\'re an owner of a Fusion handle, you can always get a small pack of the Proglide cartridges and try them out. They may well work differently for you.    "

I suppose there is a degree of subjectivity involved when you make a comparison with fresh blades. I remember that Consumer Reports was unimpressed with the vibrating Fusion when it came out, but I got one right away and liked it--even while aware that each \'improved\' razor came with ever-more expensive blades.Now there is the Fusion Proglide Power Razor. It makes claims of important improvements on what I would have thought was unimprovable--after all it is just a razor with a new generation (it claims) of blades.So the question is this: is there a positive difference?I read the information that came with the razor and on the web and was impressed by Gillette\'s audacity (for instance, a circuit board to keep an even flow of juice to the vibrator motor even as the battery runs down, and special groves to feed whiskers into the onrushing blades as the user draws the Fusion Proglide across a cheek!).I figured to keep it simple: fresh blades in my current Fusion and in the Fusion Proglide, one for each cheek; four down strokes over gel shaving cream on the left cheek for the Fusion and four more on the right for the Fusion Proglide. Little did my familiy know that my morning routine had become a major evaluation activity.Well, there is a difference.

It\'s triple blade design seems like overkill, I mean really, I can get just as close of shaves with a classic DE safety razor, and have less razor burn. If you haven\'t learned already, more blades dragging across the surface of the skin means increased chance for razor burn, it\'s just that simple. So while this razor is less prone to give razor burn than the 4 and 5 blade designs, it\'s still going to be worse than a 2 or single blade design. We\'re talking about human body hair here, we\'re not using it to shave an angora rabbit.The 3 blades are spaced well enough apart that they don\'t easily clog, and rinse very easily. The handle is nicely contoured and easy to hold without slippage at most any angle, and is textured enough not to be slippery when all soapy. Speaking of soapy, those little goo-bars on the razor are awful. They turn to slime, clear slime like when you blow your nose with a bad head-cold. It\'s just stringy and disgusting looking. They also do little to help the blades glide over wet skin. I ended up with the worst razor burn I\'ve ever had by trying to use this razor on wet skin. Once I went back to foaming up my legs with a super-slick tallow shaving soap, I was able to get irritation free shaves.The little goo bars don\'t last past 4 shaves for me before they\'re gone. They don\'t last nearly as long as the blades stay sharp. Cost-wise I\'m not thrilled either, with the price of the cartridge refills. Once these cartridges are depleted I\'ll be happily going back to my M&Uuml;HLE R89 razor with Gillette 7 O\'Clock SharpEdge blades.    "

My daughter has the worst allergy after using this product, dermatologist visit is unavoidable. Called Gillette, was on hold for 30 minutes. They said they will return the cost of the product to me. The next day my daughter was in agony, couldn\'t sleep at night because her skin was so inflamed and itchy. Went to a dermatologist, after she carefully read the ingredients used in Venus Spa Breeze, she was shocked. She said it\'s outrageous what they put in that product, she said the worst petrochemicals were used in that gel bar. Allergy now turned into infection, and my poor kid is using topical antibiotic with a possibility of starting an internal one if it doesn\'t get better. :((((( The terrible thing was that her best friend also reported similar symptoms and when I tried to shave a small area on my skin, it was inflamed and covered in blisters within 24 hours.

I can sympathize.  When you go as far as to skip shaving because it\'s too expensive, you know there\'s a problem.However, I\'ve found that the Fusion blades are, like the Mach 3 before them, worth the extra cost.  I have very thick, fast-growing facial hair, which earned me more than my share of scrutiny when I was in the military.  Therefore, I need razors that can cut through it without excessive strokes that each take a bit of skin with them.The Mach 3 was a huge improvement over dual-blade razors for me, and for quite a while I stuck with those rather than paying a premium for the Fusion 5-blades.  Also affecting my decision was the old Onion article: \'**** Everything, We\'re Doing Five Blades,\' which reinforced my perception that a five-bladed razor was nothing but a marketing gimmick.And perhaps it is - but it shaves noticeably better than the Mach 3, either because of the additional blades or some other less-obvious improvements.  Not only do I get a better shave with fewer strokes, but I can even skip a couple days and then cut through the beginnings of a hoary beard with little effort.And even better, the new razors seem to last longer than the Mach 3s, giving half a dozen shaves or more before they need replacement.  The Mach 3s gave up the ghost after just 3 or so.I certainly recommend these razors if the cost is not a huge obstacle, especially if you\'ve got facial hair from hell like I do.    "

I know I get an extra blade out of the deal, but based on what was advertised, and what various sources suggested, this discrepancy made me immediately suspicious.However, upon close inspection of the blades themselves, they seem authentic- A real lubricating strip, the little \'fins\' at the bottom of the blades resume their original shape after being pressed, the blades are in good alignment, are clean, and have what seems to be dots on them indicative of authentic Gillette manufacturing.  Even the boxes have evidence of being machine-glued, and not hand-glued. One test I haven\'t actually tried is shaving with them, but at the moment, I\'m convinced they\'re the real deal.So, I appreciate the free blade, Razors N More, but please- In such a counterfeit-saturated market, I think it would be best to stick to the letter of your product description.

I personally use the Venus Spa Breeze and loved when it first came out  a few years later and the novelty has worn off.  I find that they are not shaving as well as they used to and the \'bar\' on the actual razor head is not providing any sort of lubrication when it comes to shaving.Now onto the Pro Skin!  These come with a nifty little shower hook that suction cups to my tiled wall rather well.  What happened to the hard snap case that holds the razor in the front and brand new cartridges inside??  This was a big disappointment.  Where am I supposed to store the cartridges?  I hate when I have to separate things because I end up finding unused cartridges of a brand that I am no longer using and disposed of the handle a long time ago (HELLO INTIUTION).  After my initial disappointment and annoyance of that change I vowed to keep an open mind.  The shaving went great!  I found my legs feeling way smoother than they have in a couple of years.  The \'Moisturerich\' head really seems to work.  For me it did not drip or ooze  I think that may be a factor of how much water you are using and how long you are shaving.  My one complaint is that it doesn\'t do as well in the bikini area or around my knees because of the bar  but that is to be expected with this type of shaver.Highly recommend but wish that companies would stop skimping and charging more.  My husband actually commented on the smoothness & suppleness of my legs the very next day when he bumped my calf.  This lead to stroking my whole leg  at the time it didn\'t click that it was actually the Pro Skin razor.  I think I may replace my Spa Breeze with the Pro because at the end of the day I like my legs to feel as if they have been moisturized with lotion.

The Embrace is the first time I feel like they\'ve improved on the original design.  The Breeze has a similar moisture ribbon, but it always melts off before the blades are worn out, and the heads are just too expensive for that to be tolerable.The moisture ribbon on the Embrace is pretty solid to the touch so you really don\'t get any more than you need and it doesn\'t melt prematurely.  There\'s no residue on my legs when I\'m done shaving, just smooth skin.  The best part is I can have both legs shaved from ankle to hip in one third of the time it used to take me to shave with other razors because I don\'t need to use shave gel, and the handle and the shape of the head make it really hard to cut myself, so I can just go zip-zop.The only issue I\'ve had is that it\'s slightly tricky to shave armpits with the Embrace because the head is so big, and it\'s a bit difficult to maneuver in intimate areas.  It\'s no less effective than other razors, it just takes some adaptation and adds a little time.  That said, all in all, my total shave time -- legs, armpits, intimate region -- is half of what it used to be, and that\'s more than worth the price of the Embrace.    "

She also stated that the shave from this razor was closer than most she has tried.The only drawback to the razor is the replacement blades, which, when compared against disposable razors, can run into some money. Since I am the sucker that spends the money on new blades, she and I will have to have a talk about just how much extra this unit is worth.

This three bladed shaver glides easily, works well over sharp angles and with its built in shaving soap is the perfect touch up razor before a quick run to the pool.I mounted the included razor case (using the material provided) to the left of the shower head and keep it there in its holder. So far I\'ve managed four shaves off of one blade and I anticipate more.

There is absolutely no way this is a 4- or 5-star product. I call shill.I\'ll start with the few good things about the razor:1. It feels very nice in hand. The \'grippies\' are in just the right place. It has a nice heft with the battery in. The size and shape fit the hand nicely.2. It looks very cool. I really like the orange and grey/silver meme that has been going through design the past few years. If anyone watches you shave, they will be impressed seeing you with this. However, I, for one, typically shave alone so this isn\'t worth much.3. The battery level indicator is very cool and effective. It\'s hard to describe, but I wish everything I own that uses batteries had this indicator.4. The single blade on the back of the razor is brilliant. It\'s not as effective as I\'d like, but it is much better at keeping a sharp sideburn line than the five blades. I suspect the angle/ position will be worked out in the future.Now the bad:1. It doesn\'t shave any better than any other razor I\'ve ever used. Yeah, it gives a pretty close shave. But my tried and true Sensor Excel blades, the handle of which I purchased in 1996, give just as close of a shave without any of the other problems listed below.2. It\'s very expensive. $30 for 8 cartridges?! Ridiculous. Absolutely not worth it. The Sensor Excel 8 pack is literally half the price - still more than I think they are worth - but gives a better shave.3. I\'ve never had a more uncomfortable shave. The blades catch my stubble, making for a very slow shave. Yes, of course, shaving with the \'grain\' of your beard reduces this problem but it still happens. Most people have swirling grain somewhere on their face. This razor makes shaving those areas very difficult and slow going.4. The blades have a short lifespan. I am only able to get 3-4 shaves out of a head before the stubble-catching problem gets so bad I can\'t use it. By contrast, my Sensor Excel blades easily last 7-8 shaves - about two weeks, though by the 7th or 8th shave it is catching pretty bad too. My straight edge doesn\'t have this problem at all, given a quick run over the strop before each shave.The overall experience is expensive and uncomfortable and results in a mediocre shave. It is a disappointing product and not worth the investment.    "

When I bought the M3Power, I assumed that I would never feel the urge to buy another razor because it had 3 blades (seemed like plenty) and had the power component, so what else was there?But then I started hearing about the Fusion and I read these Amazon reviews, and I decided to take the plunge and give it a shot (oh how I miss the days when they used to send the Mach3 free in the mail!). Costco has a nice deal where it is $18 for the Fusion Power with 4 blades (and handle) so I should be set for some time. I used each M3Power blade for at least a couple months without incident so the same should be true for the Fusion. I remember when the Mach3 first came out and it was recommended to change the blade every 3 months, but now because of that Aloe strip, they only last 3 uses? To me that is nonsense and wasteful as the blades themselves work just fine down the road and so do the microfins which IMHO work fine even if there is no more Aloe left!Anyway, I couldn\'t wait to have my first shave with the Fusion, and I couldn\'t believe how fast I was finished shaving my whole face! Because the blades are closer together, it felt as though I was shaving with barely even one blade, and I did not find that hairs got stuck between them which was my only concern with the design. With the power turned on, the razor went smoothly across my face, and I barely felt anything which is really what one wants when shaving. I personally don\'t like to go against the grain on my neck, but the Fusion did a decent job going with the grain so I was most pleased. The single blade on the back was nice for evening out sideburn hair and getting at those pesky under-nose hairs. Lastly I felt as though the pivot motion of the blade head was even more forgiving than the predecessors which made the transition between shaving my face and shaving my neck hair even smoother.The only gripes I have are its cost, but that\'s obviously a supply/demand issue, and its color which is orange and quite bright. I like the blue of the Manual Fusion better, but I like the power that I get from the Power Fusion, and since color is superficial, it is hardly a big point of concern. I just wonder if Gillette intended this color to displease people so they will be enticed when they come out with the Fusion \'Nitro\' or some other color scheme!Still this is the BEST razor on the market and worthy of a buy if you are like me and don\'t go through a razor head every week.

My commute to and from work involves a good deal of walking. Over the years of trying different antiperspirants (Old Spice, Arm & Hammer, Right Guard, etc...) I had finally found something that protected me all day...Degree. I\'d get into work with my shirt looking like I\'d just went through a bit of a downpour, but my armpits were covered.So Degree is my standard of performance to which I judge the Gillette by.I also have a favorite scent of Degree (Power, which used to be Powder...But I\'m guessing the Marketing team thought men would have an easier time picking up Power). In essence my Degree serves as my antiperspirant and cologne.Using the Gillette is certainly different and away from the norm...Instructions state that the product should be applied before going to sleep and you\'ll be all set for the following entire day! Supposedly you could even take a shower and still be protected!As well, the stuff goes on clear and clean. The next morning you don\'t even know you\'ve got anything on, and it delivers on its\' promise of all day protection as well.This product really is an excellent antiperspirant, the only reason I didn\'t give it a full 5 stars is that I feel too high a premium is asked for this product. Even at the current sale price, I can get almost 2x more of my usual Degree antiperspirant at 1/2 the cost of just 1 of these Gillettes (yes, taking into account that this is a 2pack of Gillettes)!!If you don\'t mind the premium though, and you want something clean, clear and WORKS as promised...Then I wholeheartedly recommend this product.

It does shave very close, but not closer the other 3 bladed razors I have used.  After the 6 months of use, I found that it shaved very well until I had to shave over the edge of my jaw and chin where it failed to give a good clean shave right under my jaw-line and chin with the first stroke.  I found if I try to shave closer, I got to many nicks.  I only got a close shave in those areas after I lathered up again and shave agaist the grain, but at times I did get razor burn doing that.  With out question, my old Gillette Sensor Excel with it\'s two blades did a much better job with only one stroke.  The Sensor Excel seems to huge the surface of my face much better, and the Mack 3 Turbo seems not to keep all 3 blade in contact with my skins surface when going over my jaw and chin.  All in all, I would have been happy with the Mack 3 Turbo\'s shave, it\'s great looks, and I really love the new handle.  And most of the time, if I shave slower I got a great shave after lathering up again and shaving against the grain.  However, I was not happy at all with the way the blade got dull so very fast, and there not cheap!  This is by far the biggest disappointment with the Mach 3 Turbo and the reason I give it only 3 stars.  It\'s also the reason I went back to my Sensor Excel until I got my new Gillette Sensor 3.  I think the Sensor 3 shaves just as close at the Mach 3 Turbo and does ever better in the problem areas under the edge of my jaw and chin.  The Sensor 3 blades are about $1.00 less per pack and last much longer then the Mach 3 Turbo Blades.  And one more good thing, I can use both Sensor Excel Blade and Sensor 3 Blade with both my Sensor Excel and new Sensor 3!  I\'ll keep the new Sensor 3 at home, and keep my old Sensor Excel in my travel bag to use on my many camping and fishing trips, vacation or when ever away from home.  I would recommend the Gillette Sensor 3 over the Mack 3 Turbo because of these reasons.    "

I purchased mine from Zellers, from all the places in Toronto, Ont. Zellers was the only store that had them in stock, I could only assume the other more popular places like, Walmart and Shoppers Drug Mart were all sold out.At that time I had a chin strap with messy stubble on my neck and cheeks. So it was a perfect time to fix up my style.So I started with the trimmer, I love the feeling of the product, despite how cheap it cost, it surly does NOT feel cheap. The combs are easy to clip on and off. I used a size 2 to trim my chin strap down and looked great. The only downside i found with the trimmer is the numerous times i had to run thru the hair to make sure i got everything, I still ended up missing a few. Also the width is quite narrow but nothing to disappointing. Then i removed the comb and used the trimmer to line up my chin strap to easily shave around it, but it doesnt seem to trim close enough to do a line up.I moved on to the razor, I shaved around my chin strap, i love how smooth it glides across my face, but the shave was not very close as the disposable razors i was using before this. I had to go over a few times, still had missed spots and even going over that, it leaves a layer of very short stubble, no matter how often i go over it. Mind you i went with the grain, not against it. UPDATE: i tried shaving again, this time i applied more pressure to the device which did end up shaving alot closer but caused a bit of irratation on my neck. Its also not as smooth as it was the first time around, not sure why.Then i used the precision edging blade to finish off my style, used it around my strap to give it a final line up, didnt seem like it was doing much aswell, I had to shave the area a few times to actually get the left over stubble from the razor. I\'m unsure if its the product or i was unfortunate to have picked up a faulty one with a dull razor :\. So i plan on buying a pack of cartridges and i\'ll give this another go.So over all i\'m giving this a 3/5 for now, i will edit and update the info untill i give it another shot.UPDATE: Gave this item a second shot, in all honesty i like the product just because it does what it says it does. Don\'t expect a powerful device, considering its powered by a single battery. But its exceptional for the price, small, easy to storage, nice look and feel. Easy to maneuver. Its worth giving a shot. Im sure since this product was such a success, with all the positive feedback ive read through out numerous sites, they\'ll try to create a much better one in the near future.. at least i hope they do, cuz i\'ll def. be looking out for that one.  end result 4/5.

1593,1645,20090423,B001JQLNFA,4,"April 23, 2009",A23GFTVIETX7DS,"Great for travel, works as advertised, but . . .","The Gillette Venus Breeze is a lightweight, three-bladed razor with solid lubricant that obviates the need for shaving cream or shower gel.  All you have to do is wet it and begin shaving since the soap-like pieces above and below the blades turn to a clear substance the consistency of (sorry!) mucous as you shave.  The handle is molded to fit comfortably in your hand, although the weight feels more like a disposable.This pack comes with two sealed blades -- airtight so as not to dry out the lubricant.  Herein lies the first problem:  instead of a neat row of blades in a small holder, you get individual pods.  For this reason, the packaging is bulky, and it seems like a very non-green approach to razor blades.I use a Gillette Quattro as my primary blade, so I compared the two.  I used the Venus Breeze without soap of any kind, and I used the Quattro with my usual Dove Body Wash.  The Quattro shaved slightly closer, although this wasn\'t obvious until the second day.  My skin was noticeably drier on the Venus Breeze leg, however.  The best news is that the lubricant worked since I had no razor burn or other discomfort while shaving.I recommend this razor primarily for travel when you don\'t want to take cream or gel for shaving and you can pop a pod into your bag.  Because the lubricant is solid, you don\'t need to put anything in the airport carry-on quart size bag, which frees up more room for other items.This razor works exactly as advertised, although I suspect it will end up because more expensive than most choice simply because of the cost of replacement blades.

The 5 blades scared me a bit too....ouch, would that really hurt!  To my surprise, and delight....the thing ROCKS!It does give a smooth shave and seems to save me time...to my surprise.  Like others have mentioned, it is a bit bigger so a bit tougher to get under the nose....but it\'s doable.  The extra edge blade on the top is kind of cool...but I have only used it a few times.I think the three things that make this work are (1), battery vibration, (2) part under the blade that hits your skin first before the blades do....seems to lift the beard so blades cut better and, (3) five blades...5 makes a difference but the big difference is the closeness of the blades.  It seems this closeness makes it less likely that the blades cut me.  I seem to get less razor cuts.The only drawback I can see is the cost...I have had a hard time justifying the cost of razors in the past...seem too expensive, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.I highly recommend you try it.

But for most guys, it simply doesn\'t deliver the closeness the \'old-fashioned\' 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:1) They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  But in the current Proglide commercial, the cartoon is altered to show the second blade doing nothing except scraping the skin, with the hair ending up sticking out above the skin surface.  Major BS here by Gillette.2) If you\'re not comatose, you\'ll notice on their \'Take the Proglide Challenge\' commercials (the one with the used-car salesman guy), they are actually comparing Proglide vs. a DISPOSABLE RAZOR!!!  What does that prove?  How low can Gillette go???Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn\'t totally worthless.  They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  Bottom line is, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  After 2 shaves, you\'re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that\'s less close AND less smooth.    "

It has a nice, clean smell that is not overpowering. As for sweating, I live in AZ and we are already hitting 100+ degree weather and by around the afternoon I was sweating.

All the upgrades since just seemed more gimmicky to me (lotion pad that wears after 2 uses, extra blade that makes the razor too big), and based on previous changes I would have ignored this one. However I got the razor and 1 blade free in the mail and gave it a try.  I have been using the same blade for 4 weeks now and I love this thing.  I feel like that thing performs wonderfully well.  The shaves are close and it has minimized the need for shaving in reverse which i need to do.  Also i feel that the strips on this last longer because i still get that squeeky clean and smooth feeling each time.  Another big plus is how easily the hair is cleaned from this blade.  The running water removes all hair thanks to the design that leaves the front and back of the blades fully exposed.  I must say that this product exceeded my expectations.  However, i have taken off a star due to its expensive blades (almost $3.50 per blade, retail).

This includes a huge number of razor types, hair removal gels, buffers, sanders, yankers, radio signal needles, and much more.I admit that when the first more-than-two razor blades came out, that my boyfriend and I thought of them as a silly gimmick. The only reason we tried one is that a friend of ours worked at Gillette and I wanted to give her some feedback on how they worked. We thought it would be a wash. We were quite surprised that it did actually provide a better shave.In a way, it makes sense. The whole reason to have multiple blades is that hair is not all orderly and in a line. The first blade might cut off some of the hairs, but some will just bend beneath it. That bending then creates tension for the second blade to be able to cut it.If you only needed two blades, then you could do a single pass with a two bladed razor and have it completely clear all hair in its path. Of course, that doesn\'t work - at least not for me! When I then tested out a three blade razor, it definitely cut more hair on the first pass. Also, because you now have more \'cutting power\', you don\'t need to press as hard.So does this logic move on to give blades? Again, I was a little skeptical. First, the ergonomics of this razor are just GREAT. I\'ve tried many, many types of razors over the years. They can be very slippery in the shower. This one has a super combination of shape and texture. It fits nicely in the hand, and stays there securely.I also really like the wall attachment that this tucks into. The attachment holds spare blades as well. It stays securely on our shower wall and is easy to put the razor in and out of.So how well does it work? I\'ve tried it with a variety of soaps and gels. It slides smoothly and with the five blades it cuts thick hair with just one draw, without much effort. The without much effort part is really key. It means you get far less cuts, because you are not pressing down into skin bumps or goosebumps. You don\'t get razor burn because the blades are not dragging hard along your skin, slicing off the top layer.I haven\'t had any problems using it on any part of me. Underarms, legs, ankles, you name it. I would most definitely rather have the five blades with its gentle cutting power vs a smaller version. Heck, smaller razors with two blades *do* exist. There\'s a reason I use this one instead. It simply works better.Highly recommended.    "

This thing REALLY works, and works fast, and gives the ultimate cut while it\'s at it!!!  Really, really nice! He also loves the detailed cutter on the top of the blade to get precision cutting... comes in real handy!Overall, we both recommend it hands down, and we will be tossing the old razors away for this one... and paying the extra for the refills on this one... it is most DEFINITELY worth it!

493,503,20110703,B000BUUVTE,4,"July 3, 2011",A1IIUCG9TJFUWS,Wish I\'d Bought One Sooner:,"When I first heard that somebody was actually selling a 5-blade VIBRATING razor, I thought I\'d never EVER try it. It sounded like a perfectly good way to turn my face into a pepperoni pizza with extra EVERYTHING on it. The truth, however, is that this is a FANTASTIC product, and I now wish that I\'d bought one MUCH sooner.Random thoughts (since so much has already been said in the Amazon reviews here):1. I HATE shaving. I just frigging HATE it. I can never quite seem to get it just right, and I generally do end-up looking like something straight out of a Stephen King novel when I\'m done. THIS razor has actually changed that for me; I have yet to cut myself with this thing -- believe me when I tell you that (for me) that is really saying something -- and I honestly think that you\'d have to TRY to draw blood with this thing in order to do so.2. Thirty (plus) Dollars for a dozen replacement blades is absurd. (I do pay it, though. Because the shave IS that good.)3. The originally installed blade (usually) in products like these is a high-quality (pharmaceutical grade) titanium (this is true for almost everything sold in this retail space, by the way), and is designed to give you a fantastic first impression -- which it does. The originally installed (set of) blade(s) is an incredibly sharp, long-lasting set -- a finely-tuned, well-engineered piece of highly-toleranced machining that is designed to keep you coming back for more -- which means: buying replacement blades, and a LOT of them. That first, originally-installed set of blades is created to IMPRESS, and the real test of a concept (such as vibrating blades) really needs to be taken past the first usage, and deep into the experience of using replacement blades. I\'ve been using this for about a year, now... and the product continues to impress.4. Replacement blades, of course, are quite different than the originally installed blade -- but there is a simple method to make your replacement blades last much longer than they do, and it\'s this: spray some shower cleaner on the blades, and hang the razor upside down, so any moisture can drain away. The alcohol within the shower cleaner will pull the water away from the blades, and will keep it away. This will prevent the conditions that create rust on the actual blade(s) -- and without that chance to rust, your blades will last for weeks EACH.5. Shaving with a vibrating razor takes a bit of getting used to: you don\'t \'pull,\' but instead, you sort of let it \'drift.\' That\'s not exactly correct, but it\'s close enough. All you really need to do is to exert enough pressure to indicate the general direction of the stroke, and let the razor DRIFT at its own speed. You don\'t \'pull,\' and you don\'t force it. You let it drift.6. Use a good shaving gel, set-up a fogless mirror in the shower, and this thing will give you some incredibly close shaves as you stand under hot water. Take care of your blades with a bit of alcohol-based shower cleaner, hang the unit upside down so water can drain away, and this actually is a worthy investment -- even if they do charge $30 for a set of replacement blades.4 stars.Thirty Dollars for 12 replacement blades is NUTS.That\'s not even debatable.

I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven\'t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion\'s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \'hinge\' farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Also, before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren\'t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don\'t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.    "

It has a nice weight to it -- definitely doesn\'t feel cheap -- and is grippy to hold, though the razor has quite a bit of bulk to it when using the Fusion ProGlide attachment. Not something to stop me from using it, but it\'ll take a little adjustment over the \'finesse\' I had with a regular Fusion handle. The trimmer is really where this thing shines. The Braun-branded trimmer is quite powerful and is perfect for shaping up my facial hair. I use it for sideburns and to keep a unibrow at bay. Gets the job done very nicely. Nothing to plug in, it runs off a single battery and the included stand is very space-saving.If you\'re already a Fusion user, this is a nice upgrade. If not, consider it just for the trimmer. I\'m happy with how much counter space I\'ve reclaimed and that all my face care appliances are now in one convenient package.    "

At this point I have no reservations and can fully recommend the product.OLD REVIEW:I like the shave that these give -- the blades are sharp and I rarely cut myself when they are fresh.  I think that the lubricating strip is better than most when I first use the razor.However, the lubricating strips don\'t last quite as long as other razors I\'ve used and I find myself wanting to replace them after about 5 shaves (I kept my previous razors for about 7).  In contrast to my other experiences, the blades are still sharp, but the lubricating strip is completely gone.  For what it\'s worth, I keep my razor in the shower -- I assume it\'s possible that they will last longer if I keep it elsewhere.Because of the good shave at first, I continue to subscribe to these razors.

It\'s not as effective as previous Venus style blades. The good part is it\'s nearly impossible to cut yourself with this head. It is so wide, and the blades so recessed, that they don\'t really scrape the skin the way you expect. For those used to using the larger Venus blades, this will take only a little adjustment, because it\'s a little wider than the earlier models. For those used to normal shaving heads, this will seem odd and will take quite a bit of adjustment. I don\'t know about using it on more delicate spots - I don\'t think I\'d try.The blades are spaced so that they are surprisingly easy to rinse and they don\'t clog. The handle is probably the best Venus has produced so far. The shower pod is ok - the suction cups actually stick to the wall as they should and it holds a couple of spare blades.If you have trouble with nicks, or if you have boney areas around your knees or ankles, I think you\'ll like this set-up. For my part, it\'s ok, but I\'ll be sticking with the previous Venus blades, which are the best available, and give a closer shave. I might nick myself once in a while when I wouldn\'t with this one, but it\'s worth it to me to get the closer shave.

Oh I\'m sure Gillette spent big bucks to make the fusion power blades stand up to the imense stress and vibrations that occurs during the blades one week lifespan.Most likely they just think people are stupid enough to either want the color coordinated ones or that customers will think something bad will happen if you use the non-power version blades. Or people will think the power ones are better.  Bottom line: Gillette thinks you are gullible. Buy the non-power blades.The overall shave is good if you shave everyday. For longer growth the mach3 is better since you have a wider spacing between blades to avoid clogs.As with the mach3 power the vibrations seem to give a better shave: soothes the skin, helps unclog the blades, might lift hairs better.

2352,2430,20101017,B004B8AZH0,2,"October 17, 2010",ARP7M5J4MTTXX,OUCH!!!,"I\'ve read some reviews questioning if these are genuine Gillette Fusion razors, and I have to admit I am also leary.  The packaging looks legitimate, and was sealed.  The razors themselves looked cheaply made, and the blades were not very well aligned.  Some protrude further from others, and this was definitely noticeable when shaving with them.  I\'ve also read reports from anonymous Gillette factory employees hinting that the refill razors are of lower quality than the blades included in the complete razor package.  I guess the goal it to impress you with the starter pack with a comfortable shave and blades that last weeks, then make the money off you with the pricey refills of lower quality that require more frequent replacement.  I don\'t know whether this is evidence of that theory, or if these blades are not authentic.Either way, I was not impressed with these blades.  The pull the hair out of my face and leave painful irritation and red bumps.  Up until this point I have been picking up the $4 Pro Glide razors with 2 blades included.  I had no problems getting a comfortable shave with the Pro Glide package, but haven\'t tried the Pro Glide refills either.My suggestion is to avoid these alltogether, and perhaps try the Pro Glide refills.  Or skip all the chance, and continue stocking up on $4 Pro Glide razors when they go on sale here at Amazon every couple months.    "

For a long time I would get replacement blades through my Costco. Then they stopped carrying them. Perhaps this is the reason why. The blades are not the same quality they used to be. These give me a terrible shave, and irritate my  skin. I spent $40.00 on a new style Gillette razor  and couldn\'t use it. (My current razor vibrates, giving me a close shave, or at least it used to) Costco, with their  terrific customer relations, had no problem taking the razor back.

Can we return these, I am not sure. Jury is out not sure i will re-order.Update:My second shave was a struggle, if i want disposable razors i wont pay the premium. I have been using turbos for quite some time and a blade lasted me a moth at the least with 2 shaves a week maybe, I expect 4 shaves at the least from these. There is something up with these blades, not the same quality as store bought or something else. What is the mystery I am not sure but I wont be re-buying from amazon even the different branded blades.    "

The five-blade Fusion is that good.\'Fact is, you might want to take out some extra insurance on the esophagus. Close means *very* close in this case.The nice thing about an economy that spins out choices like a five-blade razor is that you don\'t *have* to buy it. Gillette\'s earlier products will clean you up just fine, not to mention comparable razors and blades manufactured by the Other Guys.But if you want close to mean \'as close as it currently gets\', you might want to invest in the Fusion (a small investment) and the replacement blades (a large one).I have often suffered an irritated face while shaving with a blade, one of the reasons I moved to a beard and an electric shaver some years ago. But so far, in the thick of the Midwestern winter, I have yet to feel any irritation.The battery-powered, chip-driven gizmo may be overkill, I must admit. I seem to get as good a shave from the Fusion with the power off as with the little hummer humming away.Factor in the cost of the blades. Then, if you still want a shave as close as it gets, the Fusion would be the thing.    "

The Sensor Excel blades were the first among Gillette razors to add rubberized \'microfins\' at the bottom of the cartridges...a standard they have included on every Gillette produce since Excel\'s debut. But with so many razors brought to market since its rollout, how does Sensor Excel stand up to competition today?Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor Excel. It\'s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Excel cartridges are noticeably smaller than, say, Mach 3 cartridges (about 1/3 smaller). The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than most razor systems today. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are very easy to shave as a result.The shave: 4.5 stars. One can tell that this truly was Gillette\'s workhorse model for quite some time, and that a lot of research & development went into the creation of this system. The Sensor Excel offers a comfortable shave with minimal drag, leaving the user feeling clean and smooth. As stated above, the blade angle and smaller cartridge design allows for easy precision shaving of sideburns and moustache/goatee areas--an ideal choice for men who maintain those types of facial hair. It is noteworthy that, as a person with sensitive skin, I felt no facial sensitivity after shaving with the Sensor Excel--something that I cannot say about newer razors such as Quattro and Fusion. For those with sensitive skin, this would perhaps be a wise choice.Durability: 2.5 stars. This was where Sensor Excel disappointed me. I get, at most, three shaves out of one cartridge. Drag and other issues resulting from dull blades arose quickly after two to three shaves. It\'s safe to say Sensor Excel has been surpassed by newer razors that have better blade coatings. By comparison, during my testing of the Gillette Fusion I got almost two weeks out of one cartridge. However, with the steep cost of blades for newer razors, Sensor Excel may still be a more affordable option.Overall: A fine razor offering a no-frills kind of approach to shaving. No advertising or fancy marketing to deal with when it comes to Sensor Excel--just a razor that does what it\'s supposed to do, well. Durability comes into question here as newer razors offer better blade coatings, but still a smart choice for those who don\'t buy into (and don\'t need) the uber-bladed razor trend. Recommended.

The Fusion  has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days\' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade.

Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn\'t careful.- Shave isn\'t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.- Design and look of the Fusion isn\'t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.- The single blade on the back is useless.  It\'s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it\'s a nice shave, but it\'s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.**** RECOMMENDED    "
